Experts said Sunday that outdoor trick-or-treating — particularly for children who are vaccinated — should be fine this year. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “It’s a good time to reflect on why it’s important to get vaccinated. But go out there and enjoy Halloween as well as the other holidays that will be coming up,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday. Dr. Megan Ranney, associate dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, cautioned against indoor Halloween parties for children too young to be vaccinated and encouraged parents in areas with high virus transmission to mask their children, but agreed that Halloween fun could go on this year. The big picture for  Covid-19 in the US  is looking a little brighter as new infections and hospitalizations decline. The average rate of daily new cases has dropped below 100,000, to 93,814 as of Sunday, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University.  Fauci said he would like to see new daily cases well below 10,000, but the decline is a start. “Hopefully it’s going to continue to go in that trajectory downward,” he said. While conditions are improving and the sense of normalcy is expanding, Fauci warned that the fight against the pandemic is not over. “We have to just be careful that we don’t prematurely declare victory in many respects. We still have around 68 million people who are eligible to be vaccinated that have not yet gotten vaccinated,” Fauci said. About 56.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Although experts don’t know the exact percentage of vaccination coverage needed to control the spread of the virus, Fauci has said the “vast majority” of the population will need to get vaccinated. “We’re not there yet,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said. “This virus can continue in those places where vaccination rates are low.” The potential for spread is especially concerning as winter holidays — often accompanied by gatherings and travel — approach. Health experts have promoted vaccination requirements for air travel this holiday season; and while Fauci declined to offer his stance on the matter Sunday, Professor of Emergency Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University Dr. Esther Choo weighed in. “Now is the time for mandates for airlines,” Choo said. “It should happen quickly because people are making plans right now for our fall and winter holidays.” Here’s when vaccines could be available for the youngest kids The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering a proposal to expand vaccines to children as young as 5, and those younger may not have a dose authorized for them until early next year, former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said Sunday. The FDA is likely to ask for more data and perhaps for studies involving more children, because it is a new vaccine and a new virus, Gottlieb told CBS’s Face the Nation. “And that could push it into 2022. Previously we had talked about trying to have that data available before the end of this year, which could have prompted an authorization perhaps by the end of the year, at least in kids ages 2-4. I think that it’s more likely that it slips into the first quarter of next year at the very least, but not too far into next year,” said Gottlieb, who is also on Pfizer’s board. The FDA has called a meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), for October 26 to discuss pediatric vaccines. Pfizer has submitted data and a formal request for authorization for its one-third dose vaccine for use in children 5-11. But Gottlieb said he expects VRBPAC to also discuss what might be needed for authorization for the youngest children. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Having more information to consider can raise public confidence in the vaccines, Gottlieb said. He is already confident and plans to vaccinate his own young daughters. “There’s a lot of parents like me that, as soon as the vaccines available for their children, are going to go out and get their kids vaccinated, that see the benefits of vaccination,” he said. “There’s a lot of parents who still have a lot of questions around vaccination. I think for them, they should have a conversation with their pediatrician to try to get comfortable with the idea of vaccinating kids.” Gottlieb said he thinks it will be years before the CDC recommends making Covid-19 vaccines part of the regular childhood vaccination schedule, which would open the door to school districts mandating them. “I think it’s a very long way off. Certainly, CDC’s going to look at children ages 12-17 differently than 5-11,” he said. What we know about the long-term impacts of Covid-19 It’s important for people to understand “not dying from Covid is a great thing, but that isn’t the only metric we should be using,” Michigan emergency room physician Dr. Rob Davidson said Saturday. He said at his hospital, some Covid-19 patients have been on a ventilator for more than a month, and some have endured invasive procedures to stay alive. Even if they recover physically, some Covid-19 survivors end up suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, due to time spent in the ICU, Davidson said. A study published in February found  30% of Covid-19 survivors experienced PTSD , which is a psychological illness that usually occurs after someone has a life-threatening experience. The virus can also have negative effects on pregnant people infected during their third trimester and their babies,  research shows . Between March and September of last year, symptomatic pregnant people at one Israeli hospital had higher rates of gestational diabetes, a lower white blood cell count, and experienced heavier bleeding during their delivery. Their babies also experienced more breathing problems, a research team reported in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine. The study has limitations since it only looked at women in one hospital, so its findings may not be true for all people who are pregnant. Then there is long Covid — when symptoms can last months after infection. A  large study published last month  showed more than one-third of Covid-19 patients suffered symptoms three to six months after getting infected. Some had multiple, long-lasting complications. Breathing problems, abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were among the most common issues reported. Accompanying  data showed as many as 46% of children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 22 had experienced at least one symptom  in the six months after recovering.

Here's how to help.","(CNN) —  More than 700,000 people die by suicide each year, according to the  World Health Organization . Translated: Every 40 seconds, someone in the world takes their own life. That’s a sobering statistic to ponder today, on 2021’s World Suicide Prevention Day. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Suicide rates have been climbing for years in some parts of the world. In the United States alone, suicide rates have increased by 35% between 1999 and 2018. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  calls suicide a “growing public health problem.” Experts fear suicidal thoughts  may escalate due to economic hardship and mental stress caused by another lethal crisis facing the world — COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A leading public health group estimated last year that as many as 75,000 Americans could die due to drug or alcohol misuse and suicide connected to the pandemic. President Joe Biden expressed his concern in a  proclamation released Thursday  announcing that September 10 is World Suicide Prevention Day in the US. “In 2019, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and the second leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 10 and 34,” Biden wrote. “And that was before the COVID-19 pandemic compounded, for many, feelings of isolation, exhaustion, and economic and public health-related anxieties. Increased rates of depression have sparked concern that we will see a further increase in suicide rates.” A study released in June further highlights those fears. The CDC found emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts started to increase in May 2020 among adolescents ages 12 to 17, especially girls. “The mean weekly number of these visits was 26.2% higher during summer 2020 and 50.6% higher during winter 2021 compared with the corresponding periods in 2019,” the CDC researchers wrote. Widespread risk All ages, races and income levels are at risk, with 77% of all suicides occurring in lower- to middle-income countries,  according to WHO . Globally, youth can be hardest hit: Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15- to 19-year-olds around the world, the agency said. And that’s only part of the grim picture. For each person who has died by suicide, many more people think about or attempt suicide,  according to the CDC . In 2019, 12 million American adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.5 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.4 million attempted suicide. “If you or a loved one are thinking about suicide, please know that you are not alone and help is available 24/7 by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK or through the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741,” Biden wrote. “Next July, the new Mental Health Crisis Line 9-8-8 will take effect. By expanding the crisis line and investing in our Nation’s crisis care infrastructure, we have the opportunity to prevent suicides and save lives,” he continued. There are ways each of us can help prevent suicide. Here’s how to do your part. Recognize distress signals There are many risk factors that can lead to an increase in thoughts about taking one’s life. It’s important to recognize these in yourself or a loved one, experts say, because many people do not talk about their thoughts of suicide in advance. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Is there a history?  People who have a mood, anxiety, alcohol or other substance use disorder, a major physical illness or a history of trauma, abuse or suicide in their family are at higher risk,  according to the CDC . Was there a loss?  A death in the family, the loss of a job or the loss of a relationship is a risk factor for suicidal behavior, especially if they feel isolated or alone without social support, the  American Foundation for Suicide Prevention  says. Economic distress is a reality facing millions who are out of work right now due to Covid-19-related job loss, social isolation or quarantine. Is there a belief system that honors personal sacrifice?  People with religious or cultural attitudes that see suicide as a noble resolution of a personal dilemma are at higher risk,  according to the Suicide Prevention Lifeline . Can they get a gun?  Research has shown that  easy access to firearms  is also a key risk factor. Did the person survive a suicide attempt?  Any previous suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor, according to the WHO. But there is also an odd “copycat” phenomena where suicides increase after local clusters of suicide or deaths of famous celebrities reported in the media. For example, deaths  by suicide rose by 10%  in the US after comedian Robin Williams ended his life in 2014. Look for actions Again, not everyone will give their friends and loved ones verbal hints about their suicidal thoughts. That’s why it’s important to look at  actions as well as words  to recognize warning signs. According to the  National Institute of Mental Health,  be wary if your loved one:   Increases their use of alcohol or drugs or starts to behave recklessly, such as driving while intoxicated or without a seat belt.   Has extreme mood swings, from euphoria to the depths of depression or appears agitated, expresses rage or talks about seeking revenge.   Sleeps too much or too little or withdraws or isolates from others.   Appears to be in unbearable psychological pain or talks about being hopeless or a burden to friends or family, or talks about feeling trapped or having no reason to live.   Begins to search online for ways to kill themselves, such as buying a gun or obtaining medical prescriptions.   Begins to give away prized possessions or visits or calls to say goodbye.   Be sure to regularly check on loved ones. During the pandemic families and friends are more isolated and alone and many warning signs may be tough to recognize. Listen carefully when you talk to them about to their concerns and observe how they are expressing themselves. If you are having suicidal thoughts If you live in the US and are having suicidal thoughts, call the  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  at 800-273-8255 (800-273-TALK) for  free and confidential support . It’s open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For crisis support in Spanish, call 888-628-9454. TrevorLifeline, a  suicide prevention counseling service for the LGBTQ community , can be reached at 866-488-7386. Befrienders Worldwide  connects users to  the nearest emotional support center  for the part of the world they live in. Crisis Text Line , which Biden mentioned, is an international service that provides a live, trained crisis counselor via a simple text for help. The first few responses will be automated until they get a counselor on the line — which typically takes less than five minutes. If you are in the US or Canada, text 741741. If you are in the UK, text 85258 and those in Ireland can text 50808. The National Health Service also  lists a variety of resources on its website .

https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/09/10/browns-chiefs-preview-patrick-mahomes-baker-mayfield-afc-contenders/,,Browns-Chiefs Preview: AFC Playoff Contenders Square Off In Week 1,CBS Baltimore,CBS Baltimore,The Browns open the season against the Chiefs in a rematch of last season's Divisional Round playoff game.,"( CBS Pittsburgh ) —  The Cleveland Browns came into the 2020 season with a fair bit of talent, but few wins to show for it. New coach Kevin Stefansky reorganized that talent and led Cleveland to 11 wins and their first playoff appearance in almost 20 years. In the Wild Card round, the Browns downed the Pittsburgh Steelers, who they had already lost to twice during the regular season. They then fell just short of topping the Super Bowl-bound (and then reigning Super Bowl champion) Kansas City Chiefs. Expectations are much higher in Cleveland this season. And the Browns aren’t going to surprise anyone, least of all their Week 1 opponent. The Chiefs, behind Patrick Mahomes, advanced past that Divisional Playoff win over the Browns to the Super Bowl. But their second consecutive appearance did not result in their second consecutive win. On Sunday, Kansas City will start what could be yet another Super Bowl run on Sunday at home against Cleveland. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts Stefansky has turned the Browns into a legitimate contender in just a season. “To Kevin Stefansky the team is bigger than any one individual,” according to former NFL coach and studio analyst on  The NFL Today  Bill Cowher. “It isn’t about how many touches I get here, how many touches I get there. Kevin Stefanski is about building a culture.” “No one’s bigger than the team,” Cowher continued. “And I think if he takes it one game at a time until he really accomplishes something. There’s a simplicity about Kevin Stefanski…  Coaching is about bringing people together, it’s about identifying what your strengths are, and, more importantly, the ability to mask what your weaknesses are. But to have people embrace the roles that they have. And I think that’s the one thing, that he has brought is humility to that football team and unselfishness to that football team.” The Browns have quality players across the lineup. And that starts with Baker Mayfield at the quarterback position. “I think he’s a terrific thrower of the ball,” said studio analyst on  The NFL Today  Phil Simms. “He moves around well. He’s got a great first move out of the pocket, throws extremely well on the run. And he has that quality. He’s got a photographic memory, from what I understand, and he’s just kind of a natural leader. I think players gravitate towards him. He grew up last year, we saw the real talent that he is.” The offense that Stefansky built, or imported from the Minnesota Vikings, gives Mayfield some flexibility, without the pressure to make things happen on his own. Cleveland was third in the NFL in rushing last season behind Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. The pair combined for 18 touchdowns and over 1,900 yards on the ground. That legitimate ground threat helped in the play-action as well. Hunt hauled in 38 catches out of the backfield. Wide receiver Jarvis Landry had 72 catches of his own, even after Odell Beckham’s injury made him the focus. Beckham’s return enhances a Browns offense that could use his speed and play-making ability, but already knows how to put up points. “Odell Beckham is going to return to this team hungry but humbled,” said  The NFL Today  studio analyst Nate Burleson. “This isn’t the same Odell Beckham from years ago, rocking the number 13 in New York City, acting like a rock star. This is an individual who’s coming off his second significant injury and knowing he’s joining a squad that did it without him and almost beat the Chiefs without him.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University The Browns should be able to put up points this week, but can they stop the Chiefs from doing the same? The upgraded defense promises to be one of the NFL’s more physical units. That starts with defensive end Myles Garrett, who has the potential to be Defensive Player of the Year. He’s bookended by new arrival Jadeveon Clowney, with tackle Malik Jackson another new addition. Linebacker Anthony Walker steps into the middle of the Browns defense, and safety John Johnson bolsters the secondary. “They’re loaded on defense,”  The NFL Today  studio analyst Boomer Esiason pointed out. “They can pass rush, they got a good secondary, and they finally got the right coach doing the right things and getting the best out of their young quarterback.” Will Mayfield be able to keep up with his counterpart Mahomes? It may very well depend on whether the Chiefs new-look  offensive line  can hold off the Browns’ pass rush. The old unit’s failure to protect Mahomes in the Super Bowl is a big reason the team made offensive line an offseason priority. They signed Center Austin Blythe and guards Joe Thuney and Kyle Long in free agency. The Chiefs traded away their first-round pick for left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. and then drafted center Creed Humphrey and guard Trey Smith. Lucas Niang steps in at right tackle after opting out of last season. If the offensive line comes together, the Chiefs offense may actually improve this season, which is a scary thought for the rest of the NFL. Kansas City was the only team to put up over 5,000 passing yards last season. Tight end Travis Kelce hauled in 105 passes for 1,416 yards, the second most in the league. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill wasn’t far behind, with 87 catches for 1,276 yards. Both return, along with receivers Mecole Hardman and Demarcus Robinson, who also remain threats. Clyde Edwards-Helaire, who averaged 4.4 yards on his 181 carries, is also a pass-catching threat out of the backfield. The Chiefs’ high-powered offense has covered for their defense in recent seasons. The unit, while better against the run than the pass, allowed an NFL-worst 415.8 yards per game last season. The difference may have simply been a function of opponents playing from a deficit and having to pass more. This year’s defense may be a step up from last year’s, given a few offseason changes. Chris Jones slides over from defensive tackle to defensive end, possibly improving the pass rush. Second-round pick Nick Bolton steps in at linebacker, though fellow linebacker and second-round pick Willie Gay will be out until at least Week 4. Safety  Tyrann Mathieu  wears a lot of hats in this defense, and Daniel Sorensen led the team in tackle last season. Mathieu, however, remains on the team’s COVID list and could miss Sunday’s game.

Ideally, the US would get cases as low as possible, but a reasonable goal would be to get below 10,000 a day, he said. In mid-June, before the surge in cases driven by the more transmissible Delta variant, the US reached a seven-day average of about 11,000 new cases a day, according to Johns Hopkins University data. On Thursday, President Joe Biden outlined a plan that imposes stringent new vaccine rules on federal workers, large employers and health care staff — requirements that could apply to as many as 100 million Americans. “We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,” Biden said, his tone hardening toward Americans who still refuse to receive a vaccine despite ample evidence of their safety and full approval of one — the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine — from the US Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Todd Rice of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville called the move necessary. He said his hospital’s staff has been pushed to the brink and he worries about cases climbing in cooler months, which typically see higher rates of respiratory problems. “The key to getting out of this is to get people vaccinated,” Rice told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Friday morning. “We have to do something to try to increase our vaccination numbers.” Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital Of Philadelphia, said that Biden’s announcement was an important step and that he “put his finger right on what the problem is right now in this country.” And some experts pushed for more. “I loved the speech; I wish he had gone further. I wanted the president to restrict travel this holiday season to people who’ve been vaccinated,” CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said. However, many Republican governors — some in states with high hospitalizations and low vaccination rates — condemned the strategy. Some even said they would challenge the action in court. “To be clear: the vaccine is the best tool we have to combat the pandemic but heavy-handed mandates are the wrong approach,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said in a tweet Thursday. But even with both vaccination and mitigation measures in place, the endgame might not be complete eradication, said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “Basically, it’s going to end the day that we have achieved enough level of population immunity, that the virus essentially becomes a nuisance and no longer a threat,” Jha said Thursday. Vaccines still as effective against Delta variant, CDC says  Since Delta has been the dominant coronavirus strain, overall estimates of Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness are “similar to those during the months before Delta became predominant,” according to a study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Friday. The CDC analyzed thousands of Covid-19 hospitalizations among adults in nine states between June and August, beginning on the date the Delta variant accounted for more than half of sequenced cases in the state. The Moderna vaccine was the most effective in reducing hospitalization, the study found. Among all ages, the Moderna vaccine had a 95% effectiveness, while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had an 80% effectiveness and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had a 60% effectiveness. Overall, vaccine effectiveness was lower among those age 75 and older, “which had not been observed previously” in this sample network. The study found vaccine effectiveness overall to be 89% among adults under the age of 75, but 76% among those age 75 and older.

Jim Justice announced in a news conference Friday. “We lost another 38 people since Wednesday. We’re going to continue to lose people in this surge without any questions,” the governor said. “A high percentage of the folks in the hospitals are unvaccinated.” How the US is tackling the virus  Changes to the Covid-19 response begin Friday, when the maximum fine for violating the federal requirement to wear a face mask when traveling will double to a range of $500-$3,000, up from $250-$1,500. And to help Covid-19 patients who are impacted by the Delta variant surge, the US is going to increase the availability of new treatments, including monoclonal antibodies, Biden said. He said the treatments “have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people.” Also on Thursday, the New York Police Department confirmed Thursday that any employee who does not get vaccinated or provide proof of a recent negative Covid test will not be allowed to work and will not get paid. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also previously announced that any new hires for any New York City agencies will be required to be fully vaccinated. Having workers chose between vaccination or weekly testing will likely increase vaccination, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said Thursday. “It’s not convenient for most to get tested once per week,” he added. Data expected on children’s vaccines in the fall  The vaccination effort is largely aimed at US adults, but with school getting started around the country, many experts and parents are concerned about how children will be protected from the virus. Children have a lower risk of serious symptoms from Covid-19 but are not any less likely than adults to get infected in the first place, Fauci said in a New York Times interview released Thursday. “So, we’re seeing more children in the hospital now because the Delta variant is more readily transmissible among everybody — adults and children,” Fauci said. Throughout Florida’s 15 largest school districts, at least 34,085 students and 6,347 employees have tested positive for Covid-19 during the 2021-22 school year, according to a CNN analysis. In Kentucky, 39 of the state’s 171 public school districts have had to close at some point during the 2021-22 school year due to an increase cases, quarantines and/or staff shortages, Joshua Shoutla, a spokesman for the Kentucky School Boards Association told CNN in a statement Thursday morning. The Los Angeles Unified School District hopes to curb spread among students by requiring all eligible children to be vaccinated by the end of the calendar year, the school board of education decided in a unanimous vote. Children under the age of 12 are currently not eligible to be vaccinated. But those 12 and older can get the Pfizer’s vaccines under an emergency use authorization. According to a CNN analysis of the latest CDC data, about 43% of all 12- to 17-year-olds in the US are fully vaccinated. Data on Moderna’s vaccine for younger age groups will likely be ready in late October or early November, following Pfizer’s data which is expected by the end of September, Fauci told the New York Times. After the data are presented, Fauci said it is “very likely” the companies will apply for an emergency use authorization.

(WJZ) —  Anne Arundel County officials announced that 52-year-old Thomas Stemen of Churchton was sentenced to ten years in prison followed by five years of supervised release for stabbing a woman with a semen-filled syringe outside a grocery store. Stemen pleaded guilty to one count of felony first-degree assault and one count of second-degree assault. He must also undergo a substance abuse and a mental health evaluation and receive treatment upon his release from prison. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “The defendant’s actions were truly horrific,” said State’s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess. “He intentionally went out into our community with the goal of assaulting unsuspecting women. With this sentence, he will be removed from our community for a long time. I am thankful for the citizens who identified him from video released by law enforcement and that the survivors are able to move forward after this senseless assault.” Officials said on Feb. 18, 2020, a woman called to report an assault that occurred earlier that day in the parking lot of Christopher’s Grocery Store Edgewater. She told officers while she putting back her shopping cart, a white male bumped into her and she then felt a pain in her buttocks. She said she jumped back and asked the man if he burned her with a cigarette. He responded with “Ya, it felt like a bee sting, didn’t it?” Once she was home, she observed a small red spot and what appeared to be a puncture wound on her buttocks. She said she also felt a wet substance on her pants after the assault occurred. Police reviewed the surveillance video which showed a white male walking up behind the victim, pulling something out of his pocket and pushing it against her. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The surveillance video also showed the same man lunging at two additional female subjects. The next day, the victim observed a large round red area on her buttocks where she was attacked and sought treatment at an area hospital. Stemen was identified by tips from the community and was arrested. A search warrant was obtained for the defendant’s residence and vehicle. During the search of the vehicle, officers found a large syringe in the driver’s side door that had an unknown liquid inside. There were additional syringes found in the defendant’s residence, including one syringe containing an unknown substance. Also recovered at the home was the same sweatshirt, pants and shoes that Stemen was seen wearing on the surveillance video. The syringes were sent to the crime lab for DNA analysis and police obtained a search warrant for the defendant’s DNA. The substance inside the syringe found in Stemen’s river’s side door was identified as semen and a DNA match.

https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/09/10/vaccine-mandate-joe-biden-legal-covid-delta-variant/,,Federal Vaccine Mandate: How Could The New COVID Rules Affect You?,CBS Baltimore,CBS Baltimore,President Biden recently announced broad new vaccine requirements with the potential to affect approximately 100 million Americans once they go into effect.,"( CBS Baltimore ) —  The COVID pandemic seemed to be waning in the spring. As case numbers fell and vaccination numbers rose, mask mandates eased, and people returned to offices. Life was moving toward some sort of new normal. It’s since become clear that the pandemic wasn’t ending so much as entering a new phase. The Delta variant has COVID case numbers climbing in parts of the country once again. Similar to the pandemic’s early days, certain regions are running out of beds in their ICUs. Most of the new cases and virtually all of the resulting hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated. Experts believe that mass vaccination combined with vigilant masking is the only realistic path out of the pandemic. Vaccination mandates are being implemented across various levels of government and the private sector. On Thursday, President Biden announced  broad vaccine requirements  with the potential to affect approximately 100 million Americans. When the federal government’s rules start hasn’t been determined. But the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA)  full approval  of the Pfizer vaccine for use in anyone at least 16 years old strengthened the legal ground on which it will be built. Some Republican governors have  promised to sue  the administration for the pending rules, claiming them to be unconstitutional. Cities And States Can Mandate Vaccines A  1905 Supreme Court case  upheld mandatory vaccination to end a smallpox epidemic in Massachusetts. The  Jacobson v. Massachusetts  ruling read, in part, “the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured A  second decision in 1922  called  Zucht v. King  confirmed the matter. In that case, the city of San Antonio, Texas was sued for excluding students who weren’t vaccinated for smallpox. The Supreme Court’s decision read, in part, “long before this suit was instituted,  Jacobson v. Massachusetts , had settled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination.” The history of our authorities implementing  public health measures  for the benefit of society dates back to colonial days. Quarantine laws, to prevent the spread of smallpox, existed back to the 17th century. States along the coast routinely required a ship’s sailors and passengers to quarantine onboard before coming ashore. New York City often required immigrants to be isolated when they arrived. To this day, tuberculosis patients can be forced to isolate until they finish their medications. Cities and states can mandate vaccines for their employees. And many already have.  New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio previously issued a mandate requiring all city employees to be vaccinated by September 13. Any of the city’s roughly 400,000 workers who don’t will be subject to weekly testing. Those who break the mandate can’t go to work and won’t be paid. The mayor mandated vaccinations for all school  teachers and staff  as well. California has a similar rule in place for its government workers. Effective last month, the state’s 238,000-plus government workers, along with its 2 million-plus healthcare workers,  must be vaccinated  or wear masks in a work environment. After the FDA’s full approval of the Pfizer vaccine paved the way, other city and state governments across the country have implemented or are considering similar measures. The  Los Angeles Unified School District , the country’s second biggest, will require all students 12 years of age or older to be vaccinated to attend in-person classes. Students must receive their first dose by October 3 and their second dose by October 31. Employees of the school district have to be vaccinated by October 15. The  Culver City Unified School District  was the first in the state to require student vaccinations. New York City has also instituted broader mandates on the local level. Customers and employees of indoor dining, fitness and entertainment establishments have to show  proof of vaccination . The rules started to phase in on August 16, with full enforcement by September 13. ( Broadway League , the theatre industry’s national trade association, previously announced that Broadway theatres must require attendees to be fully vaccinated.) While similar to mandates issued in France and Italy in July, New York City’s was the first in the United States. San Francisco implemented similar restrictions in public places on August 20. And countless individual establishments in  Chicago ,  Minneapolis , and across the country have their own requirements. Some states have moved in the opposite direction, banning agencies from requiring proof of vaccination. As of early September, 20 states have banned  proof-of-vaccine requirements  by legislation or executive order. Some of these laws date back months, to when the country was in a different stage of the pandemic. The laws tend to apply to state and local governments, rather than private schools and private employers, and only prevent requiring vaccine proof. State officials can still encourage vaccinations. Some laws are linked to the vaccines’ authorization for emergency use, meaning they no longer apply to the Pfizer vaccine. Federal Government Attempting National Mandate While cities and states have long had the power to implement vaccine mandates, it’s unclear if the federal government can. According to the  Congressional Research Service , a sort of think tank providing Congress with legal and policy analysis, “except in certain limited circumstances, including in the immigration and military contexts, no existing federal law expressly imposes vaccination requirements on the general population.” The federal government does have authority in certain areas that would support executive action to fight COVID. Congress could also effectively create a mandate by stipulating that states must require vaccines in order to receive certain types of federal funding. It seems the administration is going to test its authority. On Thursday the president  announced vaccine requirements  that could affect up to 100 million Americans. “It’s not about freedom or personal choice, it’s about protecting those around you,” Biden said in prepared remarks. For starters, all federal workers and on-site contractors must be vaccinated. The President had  previously stated  that masking, socially distancing, and regular testing would be an option. The civilian workforce, separate from the military, numbers over 2 million. Mandatory vaccinations are moving ahead for the additional 1.4 million  active-duty troops . The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is also developing a rule that would require companies employing 100 or more employees to mandate vaccinations among their workforce. That covers roughly 80,000 million Americans, by the government’s estimation. The unvaccinated would need a weekly negative test to work. Failure to comply would open up companies to a $14,000 fine per violation. The President’s announcement also included new vaccination requirements for healthcare institutions that accept Medicare and Medicaid and staffs at Head Start programs.   Today, I laid out my new plan to combat COVID-19 and boost vaccinations. Watch as Press Secretary Jen Psaki breaks it down:  pic.twitter.com/SJnjdfIjsA   — President Biden (@POTUS)  September 9, 2021 READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The move marks a clear shift for the administration. While the president strongly supports vaccines for anyone who is eligible and healthy enough, he didn’t previously think it was the federal government’s place to mandate them for citizens. The divided politics of the nation were likely a big reason why. A vaccination mandate may push some of those who are on the fence into receiving shots, but maybe not enough to make a meaningful difference. At the same time, it will harden the anti-vaccine position of all those who are against it. The move is already stirring up resentment among Republicans. Various state governors as well as the Republican National Committee have come out against the yet-unwritten rule. Republican Governors Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Brian Kemp of Georgia have threatened to sue, promising to “defend freedom” and “stop this blatantly unlawful overreach” respectively. Republican Governor Greg Abbott called the vaccine mandate “an assault on private businesses.” The president, for his part, seems resolute in the change of direction. “The bottom line — we’re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers.” Employer Vaccine Mandates Gaining Popularity To date, many employers do not require employees to be vaccinated. But it’s well within an employer’s rights, and plenty of high-profile companies have instituted vaccine mandates on their own. Disney, Google, Morgan Stanley, and Netflix are all on the list, not to mention many hospitals and healthcare systems.  Banner Health , Arizona’s largest healthcare system, mandated vaccinations for its employees, despite that state’s position on mandates. Many of the companies announcing mandates are comprised mostly of  office workers , who are largely able to work from home and largely reluctant to work alongside unvaccinated coworkers. They are also companies that has generally thrived during the pandemic. Companies that employ large numbers of manufacturing, warehouse and food service and production workers are less willing to require vaccines. They fear pushing away workers in what’s become a difficult market for hiring them. For that reason, the announcement from  Tyson Foods  requiring vaccines is particularly notable. All of the company’s employees must be vaccinated by November 1, with executives and office workers facing shorter deadlines. The nation’s largest meat producer employs 139,000 people, fewer than half of whom were vaccinated at the time of the August announcement. The company has endured multiple COVID-related shutdowns at its various processing plants throughout the pandemic. Workers have died of the virus, and families have sued the company for failing to take the necessary preventative measures. United Airlines , another company hit hard by the pandemic and the resulting shutdown of the travel industry, announced an employee mandate of its own. It was the first among airlines. All 67,000 domestic employees must be vaccinated five weeks after the FDA fully approves a vaccine, meaning five weeks from August 23. Those who fail to send an image of their vaccine card to the company will be terminated. (Certain health and religious exemptions will be allowed.) United has no plans to require vaccinations among passengers. Drugstore chain CVS updated its vaccine requirements shortly after the FDA announcement. All corporate and patient-facing employees have until the end of October to be vaccinated. Pharmacists have until the end of November. The President’s change of position is likely to spur other companies to act on their own, even before they’re compelled to by law. According to one  recent survey  of about 1,000 companies taken before the President’s announcement, 21 percent claimed to already have vaccine requirements, with 52 percent planning to implement one this year. Governments have offered everything from lotteries to scholarships to encourage vaccination. Companies have given their employees bonuses, gift cards, and paid time off. But vaccination rates have slowed from over 3 million per day to around a million, and COVID cases are steadily rising. With giveaways reaching the ceiling of their effectiveness, governments and businesses are taking a harder line. COVID Pandemic Continues Vaccine mandates will take effect in the coming weeks, and more will follow as additional cities, states, and private employers take up the mantle. Any of the roughly 80 million unvaccinated people who receive their first shot today and their second shot three weeks later won’t be fully protected until two weeks after that. And full FDA approval won’t cause many of the unvaccinated to rush out and get their first shot. Meanwhile, people will continue to be infected, and COVID case numbers will continue to rise. The  seven-day average  of new reported coronavirus cases has jumped to about 136,000 a day from under 12,000 three months ago. That’s still lower than January’s peak and the previous seven-day average. The full vaccination rate is  53.4 percent  for the country. But state percentages range from 68.4 percent in Vermont to 39.6 percent in Alabama. Many counties across the country have vaccination rates lower than that. And to state the obvious, the virus transmits within these smaller communities. Americans have received over 377 million doses, with 62.7 percent of the population having received at least one dose. Vaccination numbers continue to increase at a rate just under a million doses per day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had advised that the fully vaccinated could  forgo masks  and social distancing in most indoor and outdoor settings. Their revised guidance recommends that vaccinated people in areas with higher COVID transmission revert to wearing  masks indoors  again.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW:  Dometi excited to talk to you today man! First of all, how did you get linked up with the  VMA s and what was your reaction when they came to you and offered you the opportunity? DP:  Ah man, I’ve been with MTV News since December 2018 and I was over the moon when I got the opportunity to work for the network that has shaped pop culture around me for so long. I grew up on the Sways and Suchin Paks and the Kurt Loders and the crazy thing about it I didn’t even have cable growing up. I used to have to run to a friend’s house in order watch MTV so it was an extra special treat. My first red carpet for MTV was the MTV Movie and TV awards; I’ve been addicted ever since. Some of the work that I do in journalism is so heavy. When you get a chance to talk about your favorite albums its a treat. MW:  You’re a huge music fan, who are some of your favorite artists that really influenced you growing up? DP:  Jay-Z. It’s almost cliche to say, he influences everybody. I’m really a fan of Jay-Z. There’s a rapper out in Philly, the Roots, Black Thought of the Roots who plays the house band for one of the late-night shows. I actually have a Black Thought tattoo on my arm says how much I love him. It says, “my journalistic range is a catalyst for change,” that’s one of my favorites. But as for those that are performing in the show, Polo G. a young artist from Chicago, who I’m glad to see has transcended drill music and is now making hits that transcend culture and got him to the  VMA  stage, so I’m excited to see that kid perform. I love Kacey Musgraves she’s premiering Star Crossed performing Sunday night. It’s a lot going on this week. MW:  You mention Jay-Z which brings things full circle. The  VMA s are taking place in New York this year. What does that mean to you to have that energy that the city provides? DP:  I think it’s particular significant that we’re back in Brooklyn, back at Barclays, the day after the 9/11 20th anniversary but also in a time when we’re dealing with COVID-19 and we’re figuring out a way to safely move forward. Everyone wants to get reacclimated and see what this new normal feels like. Beyond the show and the entertainment, there’s also this air of, ok how do we do this, what does work look like, what does fun look like, what do concerts look like. It’s great to know that all the folks here will be fully vaccinated. Talent, us folks backstage are getting tested every other day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Its’ significant on multiple levels especially because of everything New York has gone through. Right at the onset of the pandemic I was talking to first responders, and they went through a lot. This is kind of a homecoming for a lot of folks right now. This is going to be one of the biggest shows ever because not only are we commemorating 20 years since 9/11 but it’s also the 40th anniversary of MTV the brand, the network. We’ll be celebrating that. We’ve got to commemorate that. Then you have a personality like Doja Cat hosting. She is unhinged, unfiltered, hilarious, crazy, exciting, all of the things, hosting and performing. I think it’s going to be one for the books. MW:  What are you most excited about for your own role? What’s something you can’t wait to do on the night of? DP:  I’m looking forward to Chloe of Chloe x Halle step out on her own. It’s funny because she was a newer act. A lot of folks are probably more excited for the Foo Fighters and Billie Eilish; I’m excited for them as well, I love Billie. But I’m really excited to see Chloe come into her own and perform solo for the first time. Had a phenomenal performance in years past at the  VMA s, so I can’t wait to see what she brings this year. That’s the one I’m on the edge of my seat for. I’m also looking forward to Machine Gun Kelly and Travis Barker with Papercuts, when I looked at that video, it’s probably one of the most jarring videos of the year. I can’t imagine what the stage design is going to look like. You got The Kid LAROI performing with Justin Bieber, Stay. Justin leading the pack with 9 nominations. I’m just excited who takes home video of the year, artist of the year. Artists, I’m rooting for Megan Thee Stallion. I’m excited for it all. I can’t even pick one thing. MW:  It will be a party in Brooklyn for sure. Thank you so much for the time and all the best with the show! DP:  Thank you so much and I’m going to invite everyone to follow us at MTV News and we’ll be reporting from the red carpet. You’ll see some of my conversations with some of the night’s biggest stars, so I can’t wait to see you guys there!

The total number of suicides increased by 18 percent from 2019 to 2020, according to the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The toolkit includes sample social media messaging, a pledge to spread culturally informed and evidence-based suicide prevention strategies, information on the state Behavioral Health Administration’s (BHA) Stories of Hope campaign and fact sheets on:   Supporting People with Lived Experience   Warning Signs of Suicide   Risk Factors of Suicide   Health Risk Factors of Suicide   Protective Factors of Suicide   Groups at Elevated Risk of Suicide   R.A.C.E. for Suicide Prevention   Lethal Means Safety   READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn During the first two quarters of 2021, suicides by firearms increased from 43 percent to 51 percent during the same time in 2020, according to the Medical Examiner’s office.

From the beginning of the pandemic, BHA has been reaching vulnerable populations through telehealth, working with behavioral health providers to identify gaps in service, and spreading awareness on suicide prevention and recovery efforts.

As of Friday, 64.2% of city residents age 12 and older have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 56.9% of eligible residents are fully vaccinated,  64.2%.

It raises concerns for many parents with little ones. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The FDA said on Friday that they are “working around the clock” to support the process of making the COVID-19 vaccine available for children under the age of 12. “The vast majority of people that we see in the hospital are unvaccinated,” said Dr. Esti Schabelman, Chief Medical Officer at Sinai Hospital. Hospitals are staying busy and doctors say it’s not just COVID-19 patients. “Our biggest issue right now is just the tremendous volume of patients that we have due to people likely delaying care during the height of the covid pandemic,” said Dr. Schabelman. With the new school year underway, Dr. Schabelman said Marylanders should not let their guard down. “With kids especially who are currently unvaccinated, there’s another virus that they get called RSV that can also present the same problems if they have it with covid,” Dr. Shcabelman added.

Here in Maryland, more than 1,100 new covid cases were reported Sunday but the statewide positivity rate remains below 5 percent. “I think people don’t want to go back down to any sort of lockdown,” said Emily McDermott. Efforts to get more shots in arms continue.

The most recent survey was conducted between Aug. 16-31.

I think the other part of it is as a guest host last season, we didn’t have a live audience. To have a live audience now is going to feel good.

I love that we have Jerry & Akbar on the show now. I think it’s so fresh and new and a great way to kick off a new season. I love that they are both dads and I think that gives such a unique perspective to a show that has previously been women and mothers. I think that alone for our audience is cool and special. Nobody else is doing this.

Meanwhile, Kloots is a mother, a former Broadway performer and an author as well.

City schools say they’re on track to meet the goal the state set: to get all schools up to speed on air conditioning by next school year. In a statement, a spokesman said, in part, the district, “reduced the number of schools without air conditioning from 75 schools in 2017 to 21 schools as of last month.” That is 54 additional schools with air conditioning since the plan was approved four years ago, along with necessary upgrades to electrical systems and windows.

The group reported 243,373 new cases among kids over the past week. While this is a decline from last week, when 251,781 cases were reported, it’s about a 240% increase since early July, when kids accounted for 71,726 cases.   “After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially with nearly 500,000 cases in the past two weeks,” AAP said in a statement.     The latest update comes as schools across the country are in full swing and experts have advised adults to get vaccinated to protect children under 12 who are not eligible for the vaccine.       As of Thursday, nearly 5.3 million children total have tested positive for Covid-19, AAP said, and children currently account for 29% of all cases reported nationwide.         Officials debate when child vaccines will be ready     As of Monday, 63% of the eligible population in the US — those 12 and older — are fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts and officials are aiming for the vast majority of the population to be inoculated.     President Joe Biden announced new vaccine requirements last week that were met with praise and criticism. The new requirements include a mandate for businesses with more than 100 employees to require vaccination or regular testing for employees.     Parents could have access to vaccines for children by Halloween, according to Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a board member at Pfizer and the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.   He told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that Pfizer is expected to have data on vaccinations for children ages 5-11 ready for the FDA by the end of September.     “The FDA says it will be a matter of weeks, not months, to make a determination if they’re going to authorize vaccines for kids between 5 to 11. I interpret that to be perhaps four weeks, maybe six weeks,” said Gottlieb.     CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday, however, that the public health agency is working urgently on a Covid-19 vaccine for younger children she hopes could be ready by the end of the year.     In the meantime, the FDA cautioned parents not to race to vaccinate their children before approval from the agency.   “Children are not small adults — and issues that may be addressed in pediatric vaccine trials can include whether there is a need for different doses or different strength formulations of vaccines already used for adults,” the FDA said in a statement Friday.     Children are less likely to die from Covid-19     Children are far less likely than adults to suffer serious disease or to die from Covid-19. Among states that report hospitalizations by age, children make up 1.6% to 4% of patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19.             Among the states that report death by age, children accounted for no more than 0.27% of the deaths. Seven states have reported zero child deaths. As of Sunday, the CDC reported 523 deaths among people younger than 18 in the United States.   Pre-teens and teens have the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates of any age group.

With children now accounting for more than a quarter of weekly COVID-19 cases nationwide, many communities are turning to a familiar public health tool: quarantines. Health experts agree that quarantines work, but also stress the importance of in-person learning for children’s development. Now many communities are struggling to toe the line between keeping schools open and keeping those who are potentially infectious at home. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Additional layers of protection, like vaccination, testing and masking, can limit the need for quarantines, but those who are against one often push back on all. Union County Public Schools in North Carolina announced Monday that it will no longer enforce contact tracing and quarantining policies for students and staff who are asymptomatic or test negative after exposure to COVID-19. Masks are optional in the school district. Angie McCray, a parent in the district, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday the decision is “upsetting and disappointing,” and she’s debating whether to send her first grader back to class in-person. McCray is a pharmacist who stepped back from work to teach her child at home last year; she’s not eager to do it again, but says she has to think about safety first. “I’m currently pregnant and I’m concerned for my family’s safety,” McCray said. “We were so excited to go back to public school and be able to let her have somewhat of a normal education, and the school board has just made decisions that are not logical and are affecting my family, and so many families in the county.” The spread of COVID-19 has created disruptions and challenges for schools already this year. At least 44,556 students and staff have quarantined in Florida’s major school districts since the start of the new school year. One middle school in Fulton County, Georgia, transitioned from in-person to remote learning last week, just one month since classes began, after an increase in COVID-19 cases. Some schools around the nation are offering remote instruction to students in quarantine or isolation, but some parents and politicians, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are resisting. “I think quarantining healthy kids deprives these kids of an ability to get an education,” DeSantis said in August. “Now maybe a parent would want a healthy kid to be quarantined, if there’s an exposure, but I think that should be the choice of the parent.” The experts disagree. Allowing people to choose whether to quarantine defeats the purpose of having one. Doctor: Actions that ‘imperil’ others shouldn’t be a parent’s choice “If you are trying to stop a disease that is rampaging through a community, killing people who don’t have to die, you really have to use quarantine,” Dr. Christoph Diasio, a North Carolina pediatrician, told CNN. “Deciding what color shoes your child wears to school, that’s maybe a reasonable parental choice,” he added. “But when your action can imperil other people, it doesn’t feel to me like that should be in the realm of a parent’s choice.” Choosing not to quarantine a child who has been exposed to the virus can indeed imperil other people, experts say. “It’s not just about our child’s health. It’s about the health of the other kids in the school,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN’s Brianna Keilar last month, in response to DeSantis’ comments. Murthy said he worries about states that are trying to block evidence-based prevention measures. “The science tells us that tried-and-true methods, like contact tracing; like isolation and quarantine, when required; like improved ventilation; regular testing — these are all the layers of precaution that we can take to reduce the risk to our children,” Murthy said. Known exposure requires quarantine in schools “Kids who are sick shouldn’t be in school, and kids who’ve had a known exposure do need to quarantine until we know for sure that they’re not infected — and more importantly that they’re not infectious,” Shira Shafir, associate professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, told CNN. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that remote learning earlier in the pandemic highlighted inequalities, exacerbated mental health issues and was detrimental to the education of all students. The group has advocated for a safe return to in-person learning this school year, guided by safety measures — including quarantining. Research has shown that quarantine measures can help reduce the spread of the virus in school and community settings. A  research review , which included 32 studies focused on COVID-19, found that with quarantine, the number of people infected with coronaviruses could be reduced by between 44% and 96%. “Quarantine is a key function of public health, especially in this disease, where people are actually infectious before they know they’re sick,” Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska College of Public Health, told CNN. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s school guidance recommends unvaccinated people and vaccinated people with symptoms quarantine for 14 days if they’ve been in close contact with an infected person. This means close contacts who are vaccinated and showing no symptoms can continue to attend school — as long as they are masked for 14 days or until they receive a negative test result — but currently, no students under the age of 12 are vaccinated. The agency says close contacts who are not vaccinated should get tested. Depending on guidelines from local health authorities, the CDC says the quarantine period may be shortened to 10 days without testing or seven days with a negative test. The CDC defines close contact as being within six feet of someone for a cumulative total of 15 minutes a day — though the agency notes an exception for students in K-12 classrooms, if the students involved are wearing masks. Transmitting without symptoms Even a seemingly healthy child who is exposed to the virus can place others at risk and increase the chance of a school shutting down, experts say. “One of the things, unfortunately, we know about COVID-19 is that people can transmit the virus for a couple days before they begin to manifest any symptoms,” said Shafir. “It becomes really important to comply with quarantine, because by the time a child has symptoms of infection, it is entirely possible that they have been infecting and exposing others already.” Shafir said quarantine measures can be used in combination with testing and isolation for those who are infected. The CDC has cited research from North Carolina and Chicago showing safety measures, including quarantining and masking, helped schools maintain lower COVID-19 transmission rates than those of the surrounding communities. Increased risk as Delta spreads The Delta variant is more than twice as contagious as previous COVID-19 variants, and some data suggests that it can cause more severe illness too, the CDC warns. “It’s one of the reasons that we are seeing kids transmitting more often than they did with the ancestral strain,” Shafir said. Kids are not just transmitting this variant more readily; they are getting sick themselves, a fact reflected in rising numbers of pediatric COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the US. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported more than 500,000 COVID-19 cases among children in the past two weeks. Still, experts say that in-person learning is important for kids’ development — as long as it can be done safely. “We’ve got to maintain the safety of the children as, at the same time, we provide them with an education in a way that does not hinder them in the way virtual learning does,” Dr. Anthony Fauci recently told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Layers of protection may prevent need for quarantines While quarantining can be a useful tool to respond to the spread of COVID-19 in schools, health experts say that when other preventive strategies are in place, it’s less likely that students will need to quarantine at all. Those strategies include masking, physical distancing, testing, improved ventilation and vaccination for those who are eligible. The COVID-19 vaccine is currently available for everyone ages 12 and up in the US. Los Angeles Unified Public Schools, the nation’s second largest school district, is requiring all eligible students to be vaccinated by the end of the calendar year. Students who decline the vaccine will be able to participate in an online study learning program. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb recently issued an executive order relaxing the quarantine requirement for students and staff who are close contacts of coronavirus-positive people — but only in schools that enforce mask mandates. President Joe Biden called on governors last week to require vaccination for all teachers and staff in schools, and announced funding to increase testing in schools. Regular testing can help ensure students don’t miss class time unnecessarily, former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said last week. He described how a “test-to-stay” strategy, which schools in states like Illinois and Kentucky are trying this year, can help prevent entire classrooms of people from having to quarantine. “There’s a whole movement around designing protocols that actually allow kids to stay in school, even after a positive case is turned over,” Gottlieb said. “Rather than quarantining large cohorts of children, what you do is you just implement serial testing around the exposure.” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says the goal is to create a safe environment for children in schools, with both masks and vaccination. “One of the most important ways is to surround the children with people who are vaccinated, if they’re eligible to be vaccinated — and that means teachers and personnel in the school,” he said.

But parents are asking when exactly the money will arrive. Last month’s check came on August 13 for those with direct deposit, or soon after for those dependent on the U.S. postal system. This month’s payment will be sent on September 15. Advance payments will continue next month and through the end of the year, thanks to the American Rescue Plan passed back in March. Democratic lawmakers are  looking to extend  the advance credit through 2025. Families can use the Child Tax Credit money however they like. That means the extra $250 or $300 per child can be put toward essentials like food or rent. It may also be spent on school supplies or a new computer, should COVID push students back into remote learning. Other households may apply the money toward piano lessons, daycare or even diapers. Regardless, the money comes at a time when much of the other pandemic aid —  most recently the extra unemployment insurance — has ended. Knowing that additional income is coming allows for a measure of security and flexibility in a world that’s full of surprises. How Much Should Your Check Be? READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The IRS is paying $3,600 total per child to parents of children up to five years of age. That drops to $3,000 for each child ages six through 17. Half of the total is being paid as six monthly payments and half as a 2021 tax credit. So each month through December parents of a younger child are receiving $300, and parents of an older child are receiving $250. The IRS has also made a one-time payment of $500 for dependents age 18 or full-time college students up through age 24.   Ready to join the millions of families who are now receiving monthly  #ChildTaxCredit  payments? An  #IRS  tool helps eligible families who receive little or no income submit the information needed to get advance payments. Visit  https://t.co/QsIMs56FuT   pic.twitter.com/lSj1RXy8Ux   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  September 14, 2021 The updated Child Tax Credit is based on parents’ modified adjusted gross income (AGI), as reflected on their 2020 tax filing. (AGI is the sum of one’s wages, interest, dividends, alimony, retirement distributions and other sources of income minus certain deductions, such as student loan interest, alimony payments and retirement contributions.) The amount  phases out  at a rate of $50 for every $1,000 of annual income beyond $75,000 for an individual and beyond $150,000 for a married couple. The benefit is fully refundable, meaning it does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. Qualifying families receive the full amount, regardless of what they owe in taxes. There is no limit to the number of dependents that can be claimed. For example, suppose a married couple has a three-year-old child and a seven-year-old child and showed an annual joint income of $120,000 on their 2020 taxes. The IRS is sending them $550 per month. That’s $300 per month ($3,600 / 12) for the younger child and $250 per month ($3,000 / 12) for the older child. Those payments will last through December. The couple would then receive the $3,300 balance — $1,800 ($300 X 6) for the younger child and $1,500 ($250 X 6) for the older child — as part of their 2021 tax refund. Parents of a child who ages out of an age bracket are paid the lesser amount. That means if a five-year-old turns six in 2021, the parents will receive a total credit of $3,000 for the year, not $3,600. Likewise, if a 17-year-old turns 18 in 2021, the parents are receiving $500, not $3,000. An income increase in 2021 to an amount above the $75,000 ($150,000) threshold could lower a household’s Child Tax Credit. The IRS has confirmed that they’ll soon allow claimants to adjust their income and custodial information online, thus lowering their payments. Failure to do so could increase one’s tax bill or reduce one’s tax refund once 2021 taxes are filed. Eligibility requires that the dependent be a part of the household for at least half of the year and be at least half supported by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who makes above $95,000 ($170,000) — where the Credit phases out entirely — will  not be eligible  for the expanded credit. But they can still claim the existing $2,000 credit per child. How Do You Make Changes For Future Payments? The IRS has three different tools to help recipients and potential recipients update their information on file, register and check eligibility. Child Tax Credit Update Portal READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The  Child Tax Credit Update Portal  allows users to make sure they are registered to receive advance payments. It also lets recipients unenroll from advance payments in favor of a one-time credit when filing their 2021 taxes. The deadline for the next payment was  August 30 . (Subsequent opt-out deadlines for future payments will occur three days before the first Thursday of the month from which a person is opting out.) Here are the remaining opt-out deadlines:   Payment Date: October 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: October 4   Payment Date: November 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 1   Payment Date: December 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 29   The tool also allows users to add or modify bank account information for direct deposit and view their payment history. Other features coming to the portal include updating one’s income, dependents, and address and reenrolling for monthly payments. To access this portal, users need an IRS username or an ID.me account. ID.me is a sign-in service used by various government agencies, including the IRS, Social Security Administration and Treasury Department, to authenticate users. Users need valid photo identification to create an account.   Some families may prefer to wait until the end of the year and receive the entire  #ChildTaxCredit  instead of receiving advance payments. An  #IRS  tool lets them do just that:  https://t.co/Qt9TAuwjvv   pic.twitter.com/eXkAzTWzdp   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  September 13, 2021 Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool The  Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool  is to help parents of children born before 2021 who don’t typically file taxes but qualify for advance Child Tax Credit payments. That means parents who have not filed their 2020 taxes, are not required to file, and don’t plan to file. (Parents who claimed their dependents on their 2019 tax return should not use this tool.) Users enter their personal information, including their name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, relevant social security numbers, bank account information, and identity protection PIN. The IRS uses the information to check eligibility and, once confirmed, will begin making payments. The IRS and experts advise using the tool on a desktop or laptop computer rather than a mobile device. Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant The  Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant  lets parents check if they are eligible to receive advance Child Tax Credit payments. Users will need a copy of their 2020 tax return or, barring that, their 2019 tax return. It’s also fine to estimate income and expenses from the appropriate tax year, though the result may not be accurate. The assistant asks multiple questions to determine eligibility, but does not ask for sensitive information. No entries are recorded.

Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 26, to 828. Of those hospitalized, 622 remain in acute care and 206 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 512,740 total confirmed cases and 9,979 deaths. There are 3,810,647 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,691,908 doses. Of those, 3,881,261 are first doses with 3,917 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,514,592 second doses, 4,049 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 296,055 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 342 in the last day. The state reported 82.2% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 14,006 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Sunday, Sept. 5. Of those cases, 1,060 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 7.4% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 6% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured This is necessary to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Maryland public schools, prevent school closures, and limit the number of students required to quarantine out of the classroom. “Our foremost priority as a Board is always the safety of everyone in our school buildings – we take the health and safety of students and school staff in every part of our State very seriously,” said Board President Clarence C. Crawford. “Circumstances require the need for a universal, statewide approach to masking in schools to keep our school communities safe and give every one of Maryland’s students the opportunity to learn in-person with as few interruptions as possible.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Masking inside schools helps protect our students, teachers and school staff as we continue to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury. “It is critical that all school systems follow this emergency law, and immediately implement face-covering requirements as one of several layered public health strategies to keep schools open and safe.” Nearly all, 22 of 24, local school systems require face coverings inside schools.

(WJZ) —  Howard County officials say so far this year, the overdose-reversing drug, Narcan, was administered in every case of non-fatal overdoses.       It’s exactly what Howard County park rangers, Ian Smith and Tabitha Kanagie had on hand when responding to a 9-1-1 call at Rockburn Branch Park in Elkridge on August 9th.     “Because of that, we were able to g i ve these fam i l i es back the i r loved ones,” said Tab i tha Ka n ag i e, Park Ra n ger.     “We the two men, we were told by family they were taking drugs, we administered naloxone and began administering CPR and fortunately were able to resuscitate them,” Ian Smith, Park Ranger.     The reversing drug Naloxone, better known as Narcan, comes in the form of a nasal spray and can quickly halt the deadly effects of narcotics, essentially bringing people back from an overdose in a matter of minutes.       “It shuts off the opioid  r ecepto r s in the b r ain. It’s administe r ed nasally and wo r ks about five minutes. It’s ve r y small, we keep it on our duty belt at all times,” said Smith. “They don’t need to be breathing for it to work, it absorbs through the mucous membranes.”           “Anything can  r eally happen at any moment in any place and you just have to be p r epa r ed,” said Kanagie.       That’s why first responders are hoping to get the drug in the hands of more people who need it.     “People with the  r ight t r aining in the  r ight place at the  r ight time can make all the diffe r ence, and that doesn’t need to be someone like me, it can be anyone, said Smith.       The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges to those facing substance abuse.     “During  a time when we were all physically distant, when there was a great deal of uncertainty, increase in anxiety, a lot of the support systems for those who were suffering with substance abuse disorder were not there….  a lot of people suffered in silence and suffered alone,” said Calvin Ball,  Howa r d County Executive.     In Howard County from 2019 to 2020, data shows a 43-percent increase in opioid-related deaths. So far this year, that number is down 70-percent from last year.     “The sto r ies put faces to these opioid numbe r s and illust r ate how the p r epa r edness of ou r  gove r nment and ou r  community to conf r ont the epidemic is p r oving successful,” said Ball.   While officials say Narcan can’t completely solve the opioid crisis, it can be a vital component for recovery.         “Feeling his pulse start in my hand, and seeing his eyes open up, it’s going to be something I’m going to remember for the rest of my life,” said Smith.     Howard County has a free opioid overdose response program that offers monthly virtual training on how to identify and respond to opioid overdoses, all attendees receive a Narcan kit.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The state Board of Education on Aug. 26 adopted an emergency regulation requiring masks to be worn in all public schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A majority of the board voted in favor of the measure, which lasts for 180 days. There was one vote in opposition. The General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review, comprised of 10 senators and 10 delegates, heard four hours of testimony on Tuesday from supporters and opponents of the state school board’s mask requirement.   The Maryland school mask mandate goes into effect immediately. In central Maryland, every school district except Carroll County already had a mask mandate in place.

READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It is a one-size-fits-all approach that does not account for the variation in educational settings and COVID-19 metrics found throughout the state or allow for local flexibility to act and react quickly to changing metrics,” the Republican lawmakers said. “It is an inappropriate overreach for the State Board of Education to reverse a local board’s decision and then require that local board to enforce a mandate or risk their funding.” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) praised the vote in a statement Tuesday afternoon, calling the measure a “common-sense mask requirement” that comes as students and teachers are already back in the classroom. “We know mask wearing helps slow the spread of COVID-19 and my goal has been to keep as many kids learning in school as possible,” he said. Marsha Herbert, president of the Board of Education of Carroll County, said the district would comply with the mandate. But she also said she was “disappointed and disheartened” by the committee’s decision. “Several of our Board members and many of our Carroll County citizens presented compelling testimony as to why this is not a good decision,” Herbert said in a statement. “Today’s action definitely takes away local control and strongly affects parent choice.” This story will be updated .

If they need a break, they pull it down for a minute and put it back up, but masking seems to be going very well,” said TABCO president Cindy Sexton. She also supports the system’s vaccination policy for teachers and support staff.

Divilio, who previously was against moving the Talbot Boys statue, said the battle over the monument’s fate has prevented the council from addressing other issues, such as the response to COVID-19, increasing better broadband access and cellphone coverage, and providing permits. “The Talbot Boys issue has divided our community for too long and has sidelined many other important things the County Council and County Government needs to address,” he said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn No local government, organization or business stepped forward to accept the Talbot Boys memorial, he added. In May, the local branch of the NAACP  filed a federal lawsuit  to remove the monument from the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse. The statue, depicting a young solider carrying a Confederate battle flag, is believed to be the last monument to the Confederacy remaining on public property in the state besides cemeteries and battlefields. Dedicated in 1916, the statue also includes the names of 84 local men who fought for the Confederacy. Advocates for keeping the statue in place have  argued  it represents U.S. history. The county council in August 2020 voted 3-2 to let the memorial remain. In response to last night’s vote, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, who had previously  called  for the statue’s removal, simply tweeted, “Good riddance.”   Good riddance.  https://t.co/YG4ld3HujR   — Brian Frosh (@BrianFrosh)  September 15, 2021 In a statement, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, another proponent of removal, said the monument’s placement outside the courthouse embodies “injustice and inequality,” adding that it was erected more than 50 years after the end of the war during the era of racist Jim Crow laws.

Pew researchers surveyed 10,348 adults in the US between August 23 and 29. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Most adults say that restrictions on public activity during the pandemic hurt economic activity and kept people from living life the way they want to, but the majority also believe those restrictions have helped slow the spread of the virus and its consequences. Ultimately, 62% say the public health benefits of restrictions are worth the cost, while 37% say they are not. Though 72% of adults say they now personally know someone who has been hospitalized or died from Covid-19, 54% believe the worst of the outbreak is still to come. Black and Hispanic people are most likely to know someone who has been hospitalized or died. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Fewer people are now wearing masks, the report suggests, with 53% saying they mask up in stores and businesses, down from 88% in February, when mask requirements were more widespread. In July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors when in areas with “substantial” and “high” transmission of Covid-19, which at the time included nearly two-thirds of all US counties. The  latest CDC data  now finds 95% of all US counties are considered to be in areas with “substantial” or “high” transmission levels. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The CDC had previously revised its guidance in May for vaccinated people to unmask before the explosion of the Delta variant. But the Pew report also found about 80% of adults say they believe mask requirements on airplanes and public transportation are necessary to address the spread of the virus, and that international travel should be restricted. Last week, the top fine for violating transportation face mask requirement doubled. The civil penalties will now range from $500 to $3,000, the Department of Homeland Security said. The previous range was $250 to $1,500. The face mask requirement is now in place through mid-January and applies to airplanes, trains and buses, as well as hubs like airports and train terminals. Other support for Covid-19 restrictions Half say that restaurants should be limited to takeout only, and 48% say that schools should be closed for in-person learning. Public health recommendations have changed throughout the pandemic, along with the science, and 61% say the changes make sense. A little over half say the changes reassure them that officials are listening to new information. But not everyone is reassured. About 55% say the changes make them question whether officials are withholding information, 53% say they prompted confusion and 51% say they lessened confidence in officials’ recommendations.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,189 new COVID-19 cases and 11 deaths, according to state health department data released Wednesday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .07% to 4.54%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 9, to 819. Of those hospitalized, 622 remain in acute care and 206 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 513,929 total confirmed cases and 9,990 deaths. There are 3,816,826 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,703,134 doses. Of those, 3,886,308 are first doses with 5,047 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,520,313 second doses, 5,721 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 296,513 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 458 in the last day. The state reported 82.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Doctors from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health spoke Wednesday about vaccine efficacy and whether or not a booster shot will be needed. The Governor’s Office tweeted that more than 99 percent of the state’s covid cases are the Delta variant. The other variants have very low numbers. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured For Joanne Scott and her family, they have not been taking any chances. “I’m not so much worried but I’m also of the mindset we should go with the original plan of staying socially distant, wearing our masks whether we are vaccinated or not,” she said. Dr. Anna Durbin at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health said the vaccines currently available will protect you from severe illness, regardless of the variant you come into contact with. “We want to stop Delta, meaning we have to get more people vaccinated,” Durbin said. We don’t need a new vaccine.” She added that vaccines will not eliminate a person’s symptoms if they contract Covid-19, in some cases. This is something many residents are aware of but Scott got the shots anyway. “Even as we know with vaccination you’re not 100 percent covered, we already know that, look at how many people have gotten vaccinated and they get sick,” she said.

But some fear it is inevitable and may become a yearly thing like the flu shot. “There’s seven more spots on the card, so I knew there were more shots coming,” Dubner noticed.

But the science of the vaccine’s effectiveness will not be up for debate, one expert said. There is widespread agreement that the vaccines are primarily intended to reduce hospitalizations and deaths — which data shows they do well, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “What not everybody would agree to is the second thing, which I believe, that the point of vaccination is to also reduce the level of infection,” Wen said. That is the issue now being debated by officials and health experts, just as the average of new daily cases has shot up over the past two months. President Joe Biden and many experts say there’s a good reason for a third booster dose. And three reports published Wednesday support the argument that people may need a booster dose of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine over time, and suggest such boosters would be safe. The reports are part of a batch of data that will be discussed by the FDA’s vaccine advisers as it considers a request by Pfizer to approve a third, booster dose for most people six months after they get their first two doses of vaccine. But there isn’t unanimity right now. On Monday, a group of international vaccine experts, including some from the FDA and the World Health Organization, wrote in the Lancet that current evidence does not appear to support a need for booster shots in the general public right now. There also is fear that a focus on boosters will distract from the mission of getting a greater proportion of the public to get their initial doses. Only around 54% of the US population is fully vaccinated, which experts agree is the best form of protection against the virus. There is no clear answer yet on whether vaccine boosters are necessary, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Wednesday, but there is “a mountain” of data for experts to consider before making a decision. Friday’s discussion will be public, he added, so people can see the data that goes into the decision. Local health departments are planning on being ready to roll out booster doses next week if given the green light from the FDA, but many still have questions, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday. “What is the interval for boosters? Is it any shorter than eight months at this point? What is the age cut-off? Will there be priority groupings?” Freeman said. “We don’t want to be unprepared. We don’t want to appear uncoordinated on boosters.” Numb to tragedy As the pandemic continues to take a toll — Covid-19 has killed more than 666,000 people and infected 41.5 million in the US since January 2020 — the public is becoming numb to the tragedy, the former commissioner of the FDA Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Wednesday. “We are somewhat complacent with a very excessive amount of death and disease,” he said during an appearance at the SALT hedge fund conference in Manhattan. The US marked another grim milestone Wednesday: 1 in 500 Americans has died of Covid-19. It’s a number that can be hard to process, Wen said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Imagine if 1 in 500 Americans had died in a war due to a foreign adversary in the last year and a half. How would we be processing that information now? What would we be doing differently?” she asked. “Wouldn’t we be doing everything we can to end the war, end the suffering and deaths? “For us to not do everything we can with vaccines and masks in the meantime, it’s really unconscionable.” The increasing number of cases among young people is also alarming experts. In the first nine months of 2021, Covid-19 infections among children and adolescents in the Americas (including the US and Canada) reached over 1.9 million, according to Dr. Carissa Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization on Wednesday. That is more than 400,000 more than there were all of last year — before Covid-19 vaccines were available to young people over the age of 12. In the US, cases are likely to rise now that schools have reopened in the Northeast, Gottlieb said. “That’s going to build,” Gottlieb said, pointing to school outbreaks in other regions hit by the Delta variant. “The schools will become sources of spread in the Northeast as well.” However, Gottlieb, who sits on the board of Pfizer, doesn’t expect the Northeast to get hit nearly as hard as the South, mostly because of prior infections and high vaccination rates. Most Americans support Covid-19 restrictions Other strategies officials have promoted to increase virus protection are vaccine mandates and mask requirements. Last week, Biden announced a plan to tackle the pandemic, which included mandating businesses with more than 100 employees to require their workforce be either vaccinated or regularly tested. Many states and workplaces had already introduced similar measures. Los Angeles is set to expand vaccination requirements with the implementation of a new health order that will mandate vaccine verification for indoor bars, wineries, and nightclubs, and recommend the same for indoor restaurants, County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer announced Wednesday. There is support for Covid-19 vaccination requirements, but only in certain settings, according to a report released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center. About 61% of adults say proof of vaccination should be required to travel on an airplane, 57% say it should be required to attend public colleges or universities and 56% say it should be required to go to sporting events. When it comes to restaurants, Americans are split, with 50% saying proof should be required for people to eat inside. For stores and businesses, 54% oppose a vaccination requirement. And most Americans believe that the public health benefits of restrictions due to Covid-19 are worth the economic and lifestyle costs, the report said.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,330 new COVID-19 cases and 21 deaths, according to state health department data released Thursday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .08% to 4.46%. It’s the fourth day in a row that positivity decreased. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 15, to 804. Of those hospitalized, 593 remain in acute care and 211 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 515, 259 total confirmed cases and 10,011 deaths. To honor the  over 10,000 Marylanders  lost to COVID-19 Thursday, Governor Larry Hogan directed state flags at half staff. There are 3,823,325 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,755,678 doses. Of those, 3,891,558 are first doses with 5,250 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,526,419 second doses, 6,106 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 296,906 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 393 in the last day. The state reported 82.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

California is projected to take more arrivals than any other — more than 5,200 people, according to State Department data for the Afghan Placement and Assistance program obtained by The Associated Press. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Alabama and Mississippi are each slated to welcome 10, U.S. officials said Wednesday. Hawaii, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming and the District of Columbia are not expected to resettle anyone from the first group of evacuees who fled during the final days of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal last month. The administration has requested funding from Congress to help resettle 65,000 Afghans in the United States by the end of this month and 95,000 by September 2022. President Joe Biden tapped the former governor of his home state of Delaware, Jack Markell, to temporarily serve as his point person on resettling Afghan evacuees in the United States. States with a historically large number of Afghans who resettled in the U.S. over the last 20 years — including California, Maryland, Texas and Virginia — are again welcoming a disproportionate number of evacuees, according to the data. Many gravitate to northern Virginia, the Maryland suburbs of D.C. and northern California — some of the most expensive housing markets in the country. Oklahoma, which over the course of the 20-year war had resettled a relatively small number of Afghans, is slated to resettle 1,800 new arrivals. Many of the new evacuees requested to be resettled in those states because they already have family and close friends living in those states, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the calls to state government officials. Resettlement agencies also have a large presence and capacity in many of those states. The State Department resettled evacuees based on the advice of local affiliates of nine national resettlement agencies the U.S. government is working with, the officials said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The officials said Afghan evacuees are advised that other parts of the country — including areas with plentiful job openings and cheaper housing — could be good places to begin their new lives in the U.S. The Afghan evacuees go through a Department of Homeland Security-coordinated process of security vetting before being admitted. And every evacuee who comes into the United States also goes through health screening. Evacuees who are 12 and older are required to get the COVID-19 vaccination as a term of their humanitarian parolee status after entering the country. Still, there have been unexpected complications. U.S.-bound flights for evacuees who had been staying temporarily in third-country processing sites were halted last week after measles cases were discovered among several Afghans who had recently arrived in the U.S. Some of the recent Afghan arrivals could also face a tough road ahead if Congress doesn’t take action to treat them as refugees arriving in the U.S. The Afghan evacuees are not currently eligible for food stamps, cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program for low income families, Medicaid or other traditional refugee services that are funded through the Department of Health and Human Services. Currently, each Afghan evacuee is slated to receive $1,225 to help with rent, furniture and food and provide a small amount of pocket money. Biden has called on Congress to take action to ensure that the recent arrivals have access to the same benefits as refugees.

The Denver Broncos used a steady performance from new quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to dispense with the New York Giants on the road. The Las Vegas Raiders topped the Baltimore Ravens in a thrilling overtime matchup to open their new stadium. The Los Angeles Chargers, under new coach Brandon Staley, looked impressive against the Washington Football Team’s top-rated defense. And the Kansas City Chiefs came back from 12 points down and then held off the Cleveland Browns to win. The West is the only undefeated division in the AFC. (The NFC West also opened with four wins.) With no matchups within the division this week, all four teams could continue their winning ways. But it won’t necessarily be easy. While the Broncos get a favorable matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars and rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Raiders, Chargers, and Chiefs don’t have it quite so easy. The Raiders travel to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers, who opened their season in impressive fashion. The Chargers host the Dallas Cowboys, looking to bounce back from a tough loss. And the Chiefs meet the Ravens, who are also hoping to put a heartbreaking Week 1 loss behind them. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts SportsLine ‘s  Larry Hartstein  breaks down AFC West matchups in Week 2. All times listed are Eastern. Denver Broncos @ Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, September 19, 1:00 p.m. (CBS) As the first overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft, Trevor Lawrence looked like the real deal. But the Jaguars are still far from a good team. They won one game last year, and struggled against the Houston Texans to open the season. While Lawrence had 332 passing yards and 3 touchdowns, he also missed plenty of receivers. The Broncos’ defense, however, is a giant step up from the Texans’. “It doesn’t shape up to be a great day for Trevor Lawrence, especially with what we saw against Houston,” Hartstein notes. “They were playing one of the worst defenses in all of football, and they were down 34-7. He threw three interceptions. He did get some points late to make it 37-21, a little bit more respectable. But now you go up against a defensive mastermind in Vic Fangio.” The Broncos defense kept the Giants on their heals all last Sunday. Saquon Barkley picked up just 26 yards on 10 carries in his return. Daniel Jones struggled to get the offense going. And the offense only managed just 13 points. Can the Jaguars do any better? “I think the Jaguars, with that offense, which doesn’t seem to be an NFL type of offense, with the pre-snap move motion, the formations, it’s not as complex as I think you need to be to be to beat Vic Fangio,” Hartstein believes. “So I think we’ll see big mistakes from Trevor Lawrence. I think we’ll see the Broncos play a very clean game, and I think they’ll get to 2-0. And I think they’ll cover the number.” Bridgewater, on the other hand, seems to be a step up for the Broncos at the QB position. He’s the QB the Broncos have been seeking since Peyton Manning retired. “He takes care of the ball,” says Hartstein, “22-3 against the spread on the road as a starting quarterback… does not make the big mistakes.” Las Vegas Raiders @ Pittsburgh Steelers, Sunday, September 19, 1:00 p.m. (CBS) The Raiders couldn’t have opened up their new stadium in more thrilling fashion. Derek Carr led three fourth-quarter drives to tie the game. Then, in overtime, he threw a 31-yard pass to Zay Jones for a touchdown and the win. Las Vegas now has to travel across the country to play the Raiders on a short week. “I just think how are you going to come down from that emotional high,” Hartstein wonders. “The Death Star in Vegas, the first time the fans were there. The excitement, the electricity, and they pull out that win in such thrilling fashion. And now you’ve got to travel east to play a very very good Pittsburgh defense, which showed up bigtime against Josh Allen and really frustrated what the Bills wanted to do.” The Steelers defense held Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills to just one touchdown. On offense, Ben Roethlisberger got things going in the second half after being held scoreless to open the game. But he still only threw for 188 yard on 18-32. Rookie Najee Harris out of Alabama averaged a lackluster 2.8 yards per carry on 18 carries and finished the game with 48 rushing yards. “The Raiders defense is not as bad as it’s been,” Hartstein points out. “Gus Bradley came in. There’s new talent. There’s [Yannick] Ngakoue, and Casey Hayward and the rookie Tre’von Moehrig. I thought they held up pretty well against the Ravens.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University All of this points to fewer points for both teams. “I’m going to look at the total here,” says Hartstein. “It’s already come down from 48 to 47. But I still lean under. I think the Raiders are going to have a little bit of problem getting going after that emotional win. And I think the Steelers offense, which we saw, is not so dynamic this year with 39-year-old — or however old he is — Big Ben. So I’m going to look under the total.” Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Dallas Cowboys @ Los Angeles Chargers, Sunday, September 19, 4:25 p.m. (CBS) The Cowboys came out firing in Week 1 and almost knocked off the defending Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The good news is that Dak Prescott seems to have mostly recovered. He threw for 403 yards and three touchdowns. The bad news is that the running game, behind Ezekiel Elliott didn’t do much of anything. Elliott picked up just 33 yards on 11 carries. The Cowboys defense remains a problem, and could get worse. Tom Brady threw for 379 yards and four touchdowns last week. And in practice this week, defensive end  DeMarcus Lawrence , the Cowboys’ best defender, broke his foot and will miss the next six to eight weeks. Fellow starting defensive end Randy Gregory tested positive for COVID and will also miss the game. “This is a real fascinating game,” says Hartstein. “The Cowboys offense looked amazing against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and they do have an extra rest to prepare. But Michael Gallup is out, and he’s one of their big weapons. You’re still going to see CeeDee Lamb and Zeke Elliott and Amari Cooper, of course, with Dak Prescott, put on a pretty good show.” The Chargers offense did enough to get the win. Justin Herbert, the NFL’s 2020 Rookie of the Year, went 31-47 for 337 yards and a touchdown. That includes converting 14 of 19 third downs, many of which were five yards or more, against a fierce pass rush. “I’m just impressed with Brandon Staley, this first year head coach, and what they were able to do in Washington,” says Hartstein. “I’m going to lean with the Chargers,” Harstein continues. “They’ve got the better defense. They’re at home. And I think Brandon Staley is turning this franchise around.” Kansas City Chiefs @ Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, September 19, 8:20 p.m. (NBC) The Chiefs opened their season with a tough win over the Browns, in what many predict could be a preview of the AFC Championship. Mahomes completed 27 of his 36 passes for 337 yards and three touchdowns, padding his already incredible career September stats. He’s 11-0 in the month, with 35 touchdowns and no interceptions. Mahomes will look to continue that trend against a Ravens team he’s owned in recent seasons. He’s 3-0 against Baltimore, with passer rating over 116. Kansas City’s win over Baltimore came without two of their three best defenders. “Tyrann Mathieu, the honey badger, he didn’t play,” Harstein notes. “Frank Clark, he didn’t play in Week 1. Both guys could be back. Mathieu is definitely going to play. That’s huge for the Chiefs.” The Ravens are coming off a difficult and draining loss to the Raiders, which could have implications for both teams, given the short week. According to Hartstein, “the Ravens are just so banged up, not just in the running back room but also on defense. That was an exhausting overtime game. Guys were limping. Marlon Humphrey stopped running on that last play. I don’t know if he just kind of gave up because he couldn’t catch the receiver. But that took a lot out of him, and he’s their best defender.” Baltimore, of course, still has Lamar Jackson, even if their running back situation isn’t what they would like. He ran for 86 yards in their opener. Kansas City, for their part, still struggles to stop the run. Look for another close game, though maybe not one where the Chiefs cover the spread. “The Chiefs have been winning close games, they haven’t been covering,” Hartstein notes. “You go back to their last 12 games, only 2-10 against the number. And the same thing happened in Week 1, where they were laying 5.5, laying 6 to the Browns. The Browns got there, losing only by four. But I think this spread, being as low as it is, being 3.5, being the Ravens on a short week, so banged up. And I think the Chiefs getting those key guys back on defense, two of their three best players on defense were not in the game in week one. I think that makes the difference, and the Chiefs do cover the number.” MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts Which picks can you make with confidence this week, and which Super Bowl contender goes down hard?

She is one of those 10,011 Marylanders who have died from COVID-19 in the past year and a half. “So, this is a picture of me and my mother when I was a baby,” Tara Green shows WJZ. “And, shopping, we loved shopping,” Green added. It’s been eight lonely months for Tara Green. “Now, I feel like I don’t have anybody,” she said. Tara is Carolyn Garcia’s only child. “Everybody loved her,” said Green.

She said she and her mother had it the worst. “Who knew that would be my last holiday period with my mother?” “I never thought that when my mother left in an ambulance that she would not come back. I never thought that I would not be able to see her,” Green added. Carolyn died on Jan. 12. She would have been eligible for the vaccine later that week. “She would have definitely got (the vaccine). I wish she would have had the chance to get it,” Green told WJZ. The state has lost more than 18 Marylanders a day to COVID since last March — surpassing 10,000 deaths, Thursday morning. “This is 10,000 people who have died. People are not a number,” Green said. The rest of the family recovered quickly, But Tara was so sick with COVID, she needed treatment at the hospital too. “COVID is the worst thing in the world to get. My symptoms over time just got worse and worse, just like hers did,” Green told WJZ. She wishes people now would do what her mom couldn’t.

(WJZ) —  The American Rescue Plan is paying off for Maryland small business owners who received millions from the federal program. After a rough year, business has started to turn for the better for Myrie’s Island Kitchen owner Christine Mattis-Myrie. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “We’re going very well, we’re doing very well,” said Mattis-Myrie. The Randallstown restauranteur has been open here on Liberty Road for three years but barely made it through 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic caused business to severely slow down. Fortunately, she got help just in time from the federal American Rescue’s Plan’s restaurant revitalization fund. “We were saved by the bell. The grant kept us open,” Mattis-Myrie added. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger sat down for a meal at the restaurant today to highlight the impact of the program. He said it provided over $560 million to restaurants in Maryland — which for some was incredibly important to help them keep their doors open. “I do think it’s now safe to say that the ARP (American Rescue Plan) was a literal lifeline for hundreds of small businesses right here in our state of Maryland,” said Ruppersberger. The American Rescue Plan also helped out struggling arts venues in Maryland like the Chesapeake Arts Center in Brooklyn Park — which missed out on thousands of dollars in revenue because it couldn’t rent out space to artists or host indoor shows during the pandemic.

Cedric will hold down hosting duties this Sunday night on America’s Most Watched Network for the  73rd Primetime Emmy Awards  and then will be back on your TV, smartphone or tablet Monday night for the fourth season premiere of  The Neighborhood . CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to Cedric for the inside scoop on what to expect this Sunday night and what’s next for  The Neighborhood  on Monday. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW:  Cedric! Good to see you again especially with so much going on right now between hosting the  Emmy Awards  and the return of  The Neighborhood . You’re a very busy man, how’s it going for you over there? CTE:  It’s going great. I’m excited about it. It’s one of those things that it’s all happening right now. I’m doing finishing touches on my outfits. I’m doing the monologue. We’re doing skits. It’s all poppin’ off right now. MW:  I want to ask you about  The Neighborhood  first, what are you all bringing to the table for season four? CTE:  Of course, we’re just really happy to be back. But we’re going to do a lot of the same things. We’re going to touch on the socially conscience matters. At the same time we have this fun light sitcom. We’re planning to do a lot more of that. In the season opener Dave finds out he’s related to me which leads to a bunch of comedy off the top. But it also leads to a conversation about reparations. We do that kind of thing where we weave socially consciousness and social commentary into comedy and in this sitcom world. MW:  And part two with the Emmys coming up how did you prepare for your hosting duties? What went into that process? CTE:  Mainly it was working with the writing team and the producers and really trying to understand the format of the show. We started by doing some of the skits. The ideas I want to do. I had big ideas, due to COVID, we weren’t able to pull out some of them. I was going to interject myself into the Bridgertons. I really just wanted to wear some tights and a cool cape. Then do mix a smashup with  The Crown  and my show  The Neighborhood , but we couldn’t have access to each other sets. It made it a little difficult to do the ideas that I wanted to do. We figured out a way to do some other ones, so I’ll just let those be surprises. MW:  So you’re not wearing a cape is what you’re getting at? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn CTE:  [Laughs] I couldn’t pull it out. MW:  [Laughs] That’s disappointing. What are you looking forward to if it’s not donning a cape? CTE:  It’s going to be a night with great people in the house. I’m just looking forward to hopefully giving some of the awards. My partner Anthony Anderson is up for being on a TV show for 98 seconds. I’m like you talk about being a genius actor. It takes longer to microwave popcorn and this dude is nominated for a role he did in 98 seconds! That’s going to be good, man. That’s the kind of stuff, I’m just looking for these winners and people to come up have a great time. MW:  Last question here before I let you go. Bringing it back to  The Neighborhood , if you could sum up season four in three words, just three, how would you do it? CTE:  Oooh. Get. Ready. ToLaugh. To laugh is a compound word that I created.

https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/09/17/rate-of-bmi-increase-in-children-nearly-doubled-during-pandemic-study-finds/,,"Rate Of BMI Increase In Children Nearly Doubled During Pandemic, Study Finds",CBS Baltimore,CBS Baltimore,The increase was especially high in younger children and those with obesity.,"(CNN) —  The rate of body mass index change in children nearly doubled from March to November 2020 compared to the rate of BMI change before the Covid-19 pandemic,  according to a study  published Thursday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s report on morbidity and mortality. The CDC team used a medical record database to compare BMI changes in 432,302 US children between the ages of 2 and 19 before and during the pandemic. BMI is a measure that uses height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured All of the children in the study experienced significant increases in their rate of BMI change during the pandemic, except for children who were underweight, the report found. The increase was especially high in younger children and those with obesity. “Preschool and school-aged children, particularly those with obesity, had larger pandemic-associated increases in BMI than did adolescents,” wrote corresponding author Samantha Lange, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s population health and health care team. This may be due to closure of many child care centers and elementary schools during the pandemic, which reduced access to healthier food choices and organized exercise programs, according to the report. In children with obesity, the rate of change was 5.3 times higher during the pandemic, which could lead to significant weight gain, the report said. During the eight months of the study period, children with “moderate or severe obesity gained on average 1.0 and 1.2 pounds (0.45 and 0.54 kilograms) per month, respectively,” the CDC team wrote. “Weight gain at this rate over 6 months is estimated to result in 6.1 and 7.6 pounds (2.8 and 3.5 kilograms), respectively, compared with 2.7 pounds (1.2 kilograms) in a person with healthy weight.” The authors said the study is the “largest and first geographically diverse analysis” looking at the impact of the pandemic on BMI and the “first to show results by initial BMI category.” The findings, the study team noted, suggest a need for “increased access to efforts that promote healthy behaviors,” including BMI screening and coordinated federal and state efforts to “facilitate healthy eating and physical activity.” What families can do There are  evidence-backed ways  adults can help address their child’s pandemic weight gain (as well as their own). READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Get moving.  Going outdoors into the fresh air helps bodies of any age.  Sunlight helps with sleep , as does a  brisk walk , which is also good for your heart. Challenge your child — who can walk faster? (Psst — you have to let them win at times.) There are lots of organized family games and activities you can try — even if it’s merely drawing on the sidewalk for fun. Take a look at this  CNN list of 100 things you can do  with your kids (or not) to get some ideas. Pack your house with healthy foods.  Kids do what parents do,  so be a role model . Take your child grocery shopping and pick out healthy items. Limit the amount of processed foods you bring into the house. When you do serve them as snacks or treats, watch the portion sizes. Picky eaters and non-veggies lovers can be nudged toward eating vegetables by watching family members enjoy them, and by having a bit on their plate, night after night. The Mediterranean diet  wins awards each year  for its health benefits — lower risk of diabetes, heart disease, dementia and more. It’s also good for weight loss and includes  many options that appeal to kids , such as food on a stick and  veggie pizza (including this recipe for a pie with a cute face ). Turn off the screens, within reason.  It’s been hard to limit screen time during the pandemic. Even experts who call for limiting screen time get that. Parents are not allowing children to use electronic devices out of any “bad or malicious thought or neglect. They’re doing it because it’s an easy fix for a complex situation — which is a frustrated, hungry, tired child, and a frustrated, hungry, tired parent,” said Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson, a general pediatrician and chief of digital innovation at Seattle Children’s Hospital, in  a prior CNN interview . “I understand why you do it. I do it, too,” Swanson said. “But all of us have to work really hard to realize that it is a super easy solution and the harder way might be better and, in the end, might be more beneficial.” Here’s why it’s so important: In addition to weight gain and a lack of exercise, studies have shown excessive TV viewing is linked to the inability of children to pay  attention and think clearly , while increasing poor eating habits and  behavioral problems . Associations have also been shown between excessive screen time and  language delay,   poor sleep,   impaired executive function , and a decrease in parent-child engagement. The American Academy of Pediatrics has tools to  calculate your child’s media time  and then  establish a family media plan .

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,525 new COVID-19 cases and 12 deaths, according to state health department data released Friday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .01% to 4.45%. It’s the fifth day in a row that positivity decreased. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 12, to 792. Of those hospitalized, 593 remain in acute care and 211 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 516,784 total confirmed cases and 10,023 deaths. There are  3,828,936  Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,767,077 doses. Of those, 3,896,027 are first doses with 4,469 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out  3,531,706  second doses, 5,287 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 297,230 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 324 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 82.5% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines both use genetic material called messenger RNA to deliver immunity, but they use differing doses and slightly different formulations. The Janssen vaccine uses an inactivated common cold virus called adenovirus — a viral vector — to carry genetic instructions into the body. “A single dose of the Janssen viral vector vaccine had comparatively lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalizations,” the team said. “Understanding differences in vaccine effectiveness by vaccine product can guide individual choices and policy recommendations regarding vaccine boosters. All FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines provide substantial protection against COVID-19 hospitalization.” CDC worked with researchers across the country to study 3,689 patients at 21 hospitals in 18 states for the study. They also looked at antibodies in the blood of 100 healthy volunteers after they had been vaccinated with one of the three available vaccines. “These real-world data suggest that the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine regimens provide more protection than does the one-dose Janssen viral vector vaccine regimen. Although the Janssen vaccine had lower observed vaccine effectiveness, one dose of Janssen vaccine still reduced risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization by 71%,” they wrote. The study had limitations. “This analysis did not consider children, immunocompromised adults, or vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 that did not result in hospitalization,” the team wrote. Plus, the volunteers were only followed for 29 weeks — just over six months.

Second-year quarterback Justin Herbert handled a difficult Washington Football Team defense last week to turn in the team’s first win. (They’ll visit the Philadelphia Eagles and host the New York Giants later in the season.) Their first home game of the season will also be their first ever game at the new SoFi Stadium. The Cowboys are coming off a strong showing that ended in disappointment and seemed to pose as many questions as it answered. Dallas lost, 31-29, to the Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a game they easily could have won. And while returning quarterback Dak Prescott played like his pre-injury self, Ezekiel Elliott was a nonfactor and the Cowboys defense continued to be a weakness. READ MORE:  Fantasy Football Start Or Sit Week 2: Is Aaron Rodgers Due For A Big Bounceback Game? Prescott seems to have sufficiently recovered from the ankle injury that ended his season last year and the shoulder issues that limited his training camp and preseason. He lit up the Bucs defense, not one of the better pass defenses in the league, to the tune of 42 completions for 403 yards and three touchdowns. The 42 completions matched a  career high . Amari Cooper and CeeDee Lamb accounted for about half of that, piling up 20 catches for 243 yards and three TDs between them. “I don’t think they want him (Prescott) to have to do that week in and week out,” said NFL On CBS reporter Evan Washburn about Prescott’s performance. “They have an All Pro-caliber running back that they pay a lot of money to in Ezekiel Elliott that was not a big impact player in that Week 1 game. I think that was more the nature of what that game became. But, Dallas, with Mike McCarthy running things, and the way that offense is structured, the running game has to be a priority. The way that they achieve balance is going to dictate a lot of how well this team plays this season offensively. So I think what Dak showed everyone — most importantly, the people in that organization — is that he’s healthy. He can throw it, the shoulder didn’t seem to be a problem. And he can move around and make athletic plays despite what was a pretty horrific ankle injury. So those are good signs. They need to be able to run the ball better to be an impact team this season.” Elliott only carried the ball 11 times for 33 yards. And while the Bucs are stout defenders against the run, the Cowboys will need more production out of him to be successful. That will be tough given the lack of continuity along Dallas’s offensive line. Right tackle  La’el Collins  was suspended for five games after the opener for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. On the bright side, right guard  Zack Martin  will return after a week on the COVID list. But the team’s top three offensive linemen — Collins, Martin, and left tackle Tyron Smith — won’t play together until at least late October. Backup lineman  Ty Nsekhe  spent Thursday night in the hospital with a heat-related illness and will also miss Sunday’s game. The unit may have its hands full with a Chargers defense that includes outside linebacker Joey Bosa. “As talented as some of those tackles are — Tyron Smith and company — Joey Bosa can wreck a game at times,” said Washburn. “So if that means putting a tight end in at times to chip him or a running back hanging in for some extra protection to give Dak that extra second, I think that those are all things you can employ to deal with a premier edge rusher like Joey Bosa. But I also I do feel like there’s talent at that tackle position, at least on one side, to be able to manage that one-on-one matchup over the course of the game.” The Chargers defense limited a so-so  Washington offense  that played much of Week 1 behind backup QB Taylor Heinicke. Part of that success comes from a Brandon Staley scheme that provides different looks. The Los Angeles Rams defense, which he led last season, would rotate out of what seemed like a pass defense to stop the run. Still, WFT running back Antonio Gibson piled up 90 yards on the ground. The Prescott-led Cowboys, should they opt for a more balanced attack this week, could be a stiffer test. READ MORE:  SportsLine Week 2 AFC West Picks: ‘We’ll See The Broncos Play A Very Clean Game,’ Says SportsLine’s Larry Hartstein There’s some talent on this Chargers unit, aside from Bosa. Safety Derwin James, a 2019 Pro Bowl selection, has returned to the secondary after missing all of last season. Linebacker Uchenna Nwosu takes over for Melvin Ingram, who signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers this past offseason. And Michael Davis takes over the top corner spot. The Chargers offense is generating a lot of excitement behind last season’s Offensive Rookie of the Year, Justin Herbert. He finished last season sixth in passing yards, with 4,336 and 10th in touchdown passes with 31. And given his 337-yard outing in Week 1 (that featured plenty of receiver drops), he’s on his way to another strong season. Keenan Allen, his favorite target, caught 100 passes for 992 yards and eight TDs in 2020. Their number two wide receiver, Mike Williams, is also dangerous. The pair combined for 17 catches and 182 yards against the WFT last week. Austin Ekeler is elusive out of the backfield and heavily involved in the passing game as well. It remains to be seen if this much-maligned Cowboys defense can slow Herbert and company. Tom Brady torched them for 379 yards and four touchdowns in Week 1. “This is a defense that’s trying to rebound from a couple of challenging seasons,” Washburn noted. “And look, they were tested out of the gate with arguably the best team in the NFL right now in the Tampa Bay Bucs. And they were able to make some plays, and you saw some flashes, despite the eventual score and yardage output that was pretty eye-opening. But I think that’s just a product of the new NFL. I think there’s enough talent defensively for Dallas to be a solid enough defense to work with what could be an explosive offense, and that should continue against L.A. on Sunday.” They’ll have to live up to that potential without defensive end  DeMarcus Lawrence . He broke his foot in practice this week and will be out for six to eight weeks. Fellow starting defensive end Randy Gregory will also likely miss the game after testing positive for COVID. The Cowboys have no quarterback sacks so far this season and may struggle to get to Herbert this week. Dallas’s secondary is also suspect, a problem that carries over from last season. And a lack of pass rush will expose it further. Trevon Diggs is a solid enough corner on one side, but Anthony Brown and slot corner Jourdan Lewis can be attacked for nice gains.

The twin votes represented a heavy blow to the Biden administration’s sweeping effort to shore up nearly all Americans’ protection amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The decision was made by a committee of outside experts who advise the Food and Drug Administration. In a surprising turn, the panel first rejected, by a vote of 16-2, boosters for nearly everyone. Members cited a lack of safety data on extra doses and also raised doubts about the value of mass boosters, rather than ones targeted to specific groups. Then, in an 18-0 vote, it endorsed the extra shot for select portions of the U.S. population — namely, those most at risk from the virus. That would help salvage part of the White House’s campaign but would still be a huge step back from the huge plan proposed by administration a month ago to offer booster shots of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to nearly all Americans eight months after they get their second dose. Friday’s vote was just the first step. The FDA itself is expected to make a decision on boosters in the next few days, though it usually follows the committee’s recommendations. The offering of boosters is also subject to approval by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A CDC advisory panel is expected to take up the question on Wednesday. The CDC has said it is considering boosters for older people, nursing home residents and front-line health care workers, rather than all adults. Separate FDA and CDC decisions will be needed in order for people who received the Moderna or J&J shots to get boosters. During several hours of vigorous debate Friday, members of the panel questioned the value of offering boosters to nearly everyone. “I don’t think a booster dose is going to significantly contribute to controlling the pandemic,” said Dr. Cody Meissner of Tufts University. “And I think it’s important that the main message we transmit is that we’ve got to get everyone two doses.” Dr. Amanda Cohn of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: “At this moment it is clear that the unvaccinated are driving transmission in the United States.” Scientists inside and outside the government have been divided in recent days over the need for boosters and who should get them, and the World Health Organization has strongly objected to rich nations giving a third round of shots when poor countries don’t have enough vaccine for their first. While research suggests immunity levels in those who have been vaccinated wane over time and boosters can reverse that, the Pfizer vaccine is still highly protective against severe illness and death, even amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. The surprise turn of events could reinforce recent criticism that the Biden administration got out ahead of the science in its push for boosters. President Joe Biden promised early on that his administration would “follow the science,” following disclosures of political meddling in the Trump administration’s coronavirus response. The FDA panel’s overwhelming rejection came despite full-throated arguments about the need for boosters from both Pfizer and health officials from Israel, which began offering boosters to its citizens in July. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Sharon Alroy-Preis of Israel’s Ministry of Health said the booster dose improves protection tenfold against infection in people 60 and older. “It’s like a fresh vaccine,” bringing protection back to original levels and helping Israel “dampen severe cases in the fourth wave,” she said. And representatives for Pfizer argued that it is important to shore up immunity before protection against severe disease starts to erode. A company study of 44,000 people showed effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was 96% two months after the second dose, but had dropped to 84% by around six months. Both Pfizer and the Israeli representatives faced pushback from panelists. Several expressed skepticism about the relevance of Israel’s experience to the U.S. Another concern was whether third doses would exacerbate serious side effects. Meissner said he is worried about extra doses for younger age groups given the risk of heart inflammation that has been seen in mostly younger men after a second dose. While the condition is very rare, he said, it is not clear if that risk would increase with another dose. Pfizer pointed to Israeli data from nearly 3 million boosters to suggest side effect rates would be similar to that seen after second doses. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he was more likely to support approving a third dose for adults over 60 or 65 but “I really have trouble” supporting it for anyone down to age 16. While an extra shot likely will at least temporarily decrease cases with mild or no symptoms, “the question becomes what will be the impact of that on the arc of the pandemic, which may not be all that much,” Offit said. Biden’s top health advisers, including the heads of the FDA and CDC, first announced plans for widespread booster shots a month ago, targeting the week of Sept. 20 as an all-but-certain start date. But that was before FDA staff scientists had completed their own assessments of the data. Earlier this week, two top FDA vaccine reviewers joined a group of international scientists in publishing an editorial rejecting the need for boosters in healthy people. The scientists said continuing studies show the shots are working well despite the delta variant. On Friday, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said that in announcing its booster plan, the Biden administration was not trying to pressure regulators to act but was instead trying to be transparent with the public and be prepared in the event that extra shots won approval. “We have always said that this initial plan would be contingent on the FDA and the CDC’s independent evaluation,” Murthy said. The Biden plan has also raised major ethical concerns about impoverished parts of the world still clamoring for vaccine. But the administration has argued that the plan is not an us-or-them choice, noting that the U.S. is supplying large quantities of vaccine to the rest of the globe. The U.S. has already approved Pfizer and Moderna boosters for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and transplant recipients. Some Americans, healthy or not, have managed to get boosters, in some cases simply by showing up and asking for a shot. And some health systems already are offering extra doses to high-risk people.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,277 new COVID-19 cases and 12 deaths, according to state health department data released Saturday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .022% to 4.23%. It’s the sixth day in a row that positivity decreased. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 4, to 788. Of those hospitalized, 586 remain in acute care and 206 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 518,061 total confirmed cases and 10,035 deaths. There are  3,835,130  Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,779,952 doses. Of those, 3,901,097 are first doses with 5,070 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out  3,537,592  second doses, 5,886 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 297,538 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 308 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 82.6% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15.

But the positivity rate went down again, to 4.22 percent. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured And it’s the sixth day that it’s decreased. The vaccination effort continued Saturday across the state including in one of its zip codes hit hardest by COVID, 21215. Saturday, the New Psalmist Baptist Church worked with the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital to offer more shots of the vaccine for kids who are going back to school so that more of this community is protected against the virus. Dozens lined up for shots of the COVID-19 vaccine at this event. “It is critical that we do vaccinations. That we get the vaccine in person’s bodies,” said Bishop Walter Thomas, the church’s pastor. More than 5,600 people in the 21215 zip code have been diagnosed with COVID-19. The goal here was to get more people in the community vaccinated with the help of trusted church leaders. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It feels a lot more comfortable to receive the vaccination knowing that people you already know and trust are right at your side supporting you through it so we really have appreciated this collaboration,” said Dr. Rebecca Carter, director of community outreach and engagement at the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital. Thomas said he worked with the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital to host the event because he wants to get as many people vaccinated as quickly possible. “The only way we’re going to get back to some semblance of life and build upon it for the future is to stop this virus in its tracks,” he said. The state health department reports that almost 48 percent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated against covid-19 in 21215, meaning more than half the people in it don’t have the extra layer of protection the vaccine offers. Thomas says the only way to safely protect against the virus is with the vaccine. “It won’t stop with rhetoric it won’t stop with arguments. It will only stop with a vaccination,” he said. And as of Saturday, almost 58 percent of people eligible for the vaccine in Baltimore have been fully vaccinated.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,036 new COVID-19 cases but no new deaths, according to state health department data released Sunday morning.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 19, to 807. Of those hospitalized, 599 remain in acute care and 208 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 519,097 total confirmed cases and 10,035 deaths. There are  3,840,482  Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,790,403 doses. Of those, 3,905,156 are first doses with 4,059 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out  3,542,758  second doses, 5,166 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 297,724 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 186 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 82.8% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state.

Maryland now has a mask mandate for all public schools but not all states require them and some officials think that leaves children susceptible to COVID-19 infection and with many schools no longer offering a virtual option, the discussion changes weekly when it comes to keeping children safe. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured On Sunday, no new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours in Maryland but the number of people in the hospital remains up. The positivity hit 4.34 percent overnight as more than 1000 people tested positive since Saturday. But one question about school-aged children still remains on the minds of many parents and educators — are children safe in schools? “The most significant and severe parts of this disease where it becomes fatal is not affecting children how it affects adults,” said Beth Blauer, Public Sector Innovation, Johns Hopkins. The Coronavirus Resource Center believes children are still in the lowest susceptible age group to COVID-19. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It’s still unclear whether the Delta variant causes more severe disease in children,” said Dr. William Moss with the International Vaccine Access Center. But as many are unprotected by the vaccine, many schools across the country have implemented a mask mandate. Some, like Dallas, are breaking state rulings to do so. “It’s not COVID 1.0 now we have 363 students and 259 staff,” said Dr. Michael Hinojosa, Superintendent, Dallas Independent Schools. Dr. Moss from the International Vaccine Access Center said the FDA is requiring six months of testing for ages under 12. The adult vaccine testing period was two months. He thinks ages five to 11 could be approved for the Pfizer vaccine as early as late October and ages two to five may be approved by early 2022.

From episode one to season 14 Dr. Ordon has been around since the very beginning and is ready to kick off a brand new season with brand new challenges. CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke with Dr. Ordon about the show’s latest milestone, return to school and elective surgery safety. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW:  Hello Dr. Ordon! Congrats on kicking off season 14 today. What does 14 seasons mean to you? Dr. O:  It means a lot. I was one of the original fab four as it were. The seasons have evolved. It’s always been the  The Doctors;  plural. We’ve had different hosts; we like to mix it up and emphasize certain areas of medicine. I’ve made the journey 14 years. I’m now sort of in the driver’s seat but I’ve got great co-hosts with me. I am blessed. I go out and whether it be here in the US, the show is in 144 countries; I travel, and people come up to me and they tell me, your show has made a difference, I love watching it, great information, I learn, but I have fun at the same time. That to me, that feedback is priceless. MW:  The theme of this season is health and empowerment. How can people at home help themselves in those two departments? Dr. O:  A lot of us are still at home. It’s a different world. It’s troubling, uncertain times. We’re not quite out of COVID yet. A lot of people are still not getting back to their doctors, I want them to, but they come to us as a source for medical information. We’re going to cover all of our basis how to empower you to be your best health advocate. Health on a budget, dispelling medical myths, sifting through all of this medical misinformation that we’re seeing on the internet. It’s sort of an epidemic within the pandemic, this sort of mistrust mainstream medicine doctors. Why? I don’t know. I think it’s influenced by social media and the internet. We’re going to put our best foot forward and give people the right information based on science and medical information to keep them safe and well. MW:  Glad you said that. It leads into my next question, over the last two years a lot of people put off routine care or elective surgeries. Can you speak to how safe these things are now? Dr. O:  A lot of people did put off things. The whole way we practice medicine has changed. As a plastic surgeon, a lot of things we put in place in the office to make it safer. Everybody has to fill out a questionnaire. Everybody has to wear a mask. Anyone undergoing surgery has to be COVID tested. For the majority of people, we want them vaccinated. It is safe to go ahead, see your doctor, get those yearly checkups. If you’ve been putting off elective surgery, you can do it safely because the hospital, surgery center, doctors’ offices, they’re in tune with what’s going on now. Everything is in place to make sure you stay safe and healthy. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn MW:  We’re also heading into the fall, then the winter shortly after that. We’re getting into flu season. A lot of people want to know, should I get the flu vaccine with the COVID vaccine? Dr. O:  Matt, I’m so glad you brought this up. That’s right fall. What is fall? It’s flu and cold season. Guess what, the symptoms of the common cold and flu mimic some of the symptoms of COVID, so we’re going to have a lot fear, uncertainty. Anybody who gets a cold is going to think they have COVID. We’re going to see a lot more testing going on this time of year. But to your point about flu, so important. We’ve been saying it for 14 years, every year, make sure you get that flu shot. It does make a difference. On top of that, we have to be particularly vigilant because we’re in flu and cold season, wearing a mask, washing our hands, social distancing when you sneeze. A-choo, do it in your sleeve. Something we’ve been preaching for 14 years. All of those things work. MW:  Pull a cape over your face, right? Dr. O:  If you have a cape sure, pull it over your face [laughs] MW:  Fall is also back to school, a lot of kids are concerned, a lot of parents are concerned. What advice do you give for staying safe and healthy in school? Dr. O:  We are concerned for our kids, but at the same time. It’s time for our kids to go back to school, but we have to do it safely. Unfortunately, kids younger than 12, they don’t qualify for a vaccine, yet. But that’s coming up the pipe. The CDC is looking at the Pfizer trials in kids, we’re going to see that soon. In the meantime, kids, they’re in jeopardy. In fact, this week we’re taping the show, one teacher infected basically an entire elementary school in Florida. It’s happening. We don’t want that to happen to our kids so we have to practice everything we know we should do. That’s if anybody has symptoms at home, don’t send your child to school. I’m sorry, masking is better in school. We do have to social distance; I know the kids are excited to be back with their friends, but we have to be smart about it. Kids have to wash their hands, social distancing. I know we’re tired of it and it’s tough with kids to get them to do all of these things, but it’s particularly important. We want them to be safe and back in school. MW:  Thank you for all the insight and the time Dr. Ordon! Dr. O:  Thank you!

That’s according to the Maryland Department of Health, which released an update Monday to its list of top- and bottom-ranked nursing facilities when it comes to vaccination rates among staff.

In contrast, 10 facilities have vaccination rates of 61 percent or lower. Another 13 facilities were singled out by the MDH for not providing adequate data on their staffs’ vaccination rates. “I want to commend the  staff  at the 91  nursing   facilities   in  the state where 90 percent or more of  staff  now have at least  on e dose of a life-saving COVID-19 vaccine,” said MDH Secretary Dennis R. Schrader. “The state has imposed an additional $112,500 in fines on 32 facilities that are failing to comply with protocols and putting lives at risk.” Under vaccination protocols that took effect Sept. 1, all nursing facility staff throughout the state must have at least one dose of the vaccine. Facilities that fall short of this requirement or do not submit vaccination data to the state could face fines and disciplinary action.

Ann-Hewitt Wakefield, also known as “Grammy Hootie,” is 102 years old. She came to watch both of her grandsons play against each other in a marquee matchup between Breck School and Concordia Academy. Last year, the great-grandmother was not able to watch her grandsons play against each other due to the pandemic.   Last year, she also contracted COVID during that time. To make up for missing that game, this year Wakefield attended the Breck and Concordia game.   “Oh I love it. I love sports,” Wakefield tells WCCO-TV. “It’s wonderful. All my kids are in sports, my grandchildren, my great grandchildren. I have a big family.”   Carter Theissen and Christian Brown are Wakefield’s great grandsons, who played against each other during Friday night’s game. Theissen plays for Breck School as a wide receiver. Brown is a running back for Concordia Academy.   “I got a little pressure on me with my great grandma here,” Theissen said.   “I’m just glad she’s here,” added Brown.   With the last challenging year-and-a-half, Wakefield said there’s nowhere else she would rather be than at a Friday night football game.   “I’m always playing for her,” Theissen said. “She’s going to be at this game watching me play, so definitely.”   Breck won Friday night’s game.

In my experience, intimate partners are often the first person law enforcement focuses their attention on in cases like this and the warning that ‘any statement made will be used against you’ is true, regardless of whether my client had anything to do with Ms. Petito’s disappearance. As such, on the advice of counsel Mr. Laundrie is not speaking on this matter.   I have been informed that the North Port, Florida police have named Brian Laundrie as a ‘person of interest’ in this matter.

Arlotto previously stated that he favored the implementation of a vaccination-or-testing model and the school system had been putting the final logistical steps in place to enact it for several weeks. “Requiring vaccinations or testing among student-athletes will help ensure that AACPS can continue full competitive seasons in the winter and spring,” Dr. Arlotto said.

The U.S. population a century ago was just one-third of what it is today, meaning the flu cut a much bigger, more lethal swath through the country. But the COVID-19 crisis is by any measure a colossal tragedy in its own right, especially given the incredible advances in scientific knowledge since then and the failure to take maximum advantage of the vaccines available this time. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Big pockets of American society — and, worse, their leaders — have thrown this away,” medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan said of the opportunity to vaccinate everyone eligible by now. Like the Spanish flu, the coronavirus may never entirely disappear from our midst. Instead, scientists hope it becomes a mild seasonal bug as human immunity strengthens through vaccination and repeated infection. That could take time. “We hope it will be like getting a cold, but there’s no guarantee,” said Emory University biologist Rustom Antia, who suggests an optimistic scenario in which this could happen over a few years. For now, the pandemic still has the United States and other parts of the world firmly in its jaws. While the delta-fueled surge in infections may have peaked, U.S. deaths are running at over 1,900 a day on average, the highest level since early March, and the country’s overall toll topped 675,000 Monday, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University, though the real number is believed to be higher. Winter may bring a new surge, with the University of Washington’s influential model projecting an additional 100,000 or so Americans will die of COVID-19 by Jan. 1, which would bring the overall U.S. toll to 776,000. The 1918-19 influenza pandemic killed 50 million victims globally at a time when the world had one-quarter the population it does now. Global deaths from COVID-19 now stand at more than 4.6 million. The Spanish flu’s U.S. death toll is a rough guess, given the incomplete records of the era and the poor scientific understanding of what caused the illness. The 675,000 figure comes from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The ebbing of COVID-19 could happen if the virus progressively weakens as it mutates and more and more humans’ immune systems learn to attack it. Vaccination and surviving infection are the main ways the immune system improves. Breast-fed infants also gain some immunity from their mothers. Under that optimistic scenario, schoolchildren would get mild illness that trains their immune systems. As they grow up, the children would carry the immune response memory, so that when they are old and vulnerable, the coronavirus would be no more dangerous than cold viruses. The same goes for today’s vaccinated teens: Their immune systems would get stronger through the shots and mild infections. “We will all get infected,” Antia predicted. “What’s important is whether the infections are severe.” Something similar happened with the H1N1 flu virus, the culprit in the 1918-19 pandemic. It encountered too many people who were immune, and it also eventually weakened through mutation. H1N1 still circulates today, but immunity acquired through infection and vaccination has triumphed. Getting an annual flu shot now protects against H1N1 and several other strains of flu. To be sure, flu kills between 12,000 and 61,000 Americans each year, but on average, it is a seasonal problem and a manageable one. Before COVID-19, the 1918-19 flu was universally considered the worst pandemic disease in human history. Whether the current scourge ultimately proves deadlier is unclear. In many ways, the 1918-19 flu — which was wrongly named Spanish flu because it first received widespread news coverage in Spain — was worse. Spread by the mobility of World War I, it killed young, healthy adults in vast numbers. No vaccine existed to slow it, and there were no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections. And, of course, the world was much smaller. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Yet jet travel and mass migrations threaten to increase the toll of the current pandemic. Much of the world is unvaccinated. And the coronavirus has been full of surprises. Markel said he is continually astounded by the magnitude of the disruption the pandemic has brought to the planet. “I was gobsmacked by the size of the quarantines” the Chinese government undertook initially, Markel said, “and I’ve since been gob-gob-gob-smacked to the nth degree.” The lagging pace of U.S. vaccinations is the latest source of his astonishment. Just under 64% of the U.S. population has received as least one dose of the vaccine, with state rates ranging from a high of approximately 77% in Vermont and Massachusetts to lows around 46% to 49% in Idaho, Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi. Globally, about 43% of the population has received at least one dose, according to Our World in Data, with some African countries just beginning to give their first shots. “We know that all pandemics come to an end,” said Dr. Jeremy Brown, director of emergency care research at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote a book on influenza. “They can do terrible things while they’re raging.” COVID-19 could have been far less lethal in the U.S. if more people had gotten vaccinated faster, “and we still have an opportunity to turn it around,” Brown said. “We often lose sight of how lucky we are to take these things for granted.” The current vaccines work extremely well in preventing severe disease and death from the variants of the virus that have emerged so far. It will be crucial for scientists to make sure the ever-mutating virus hasn’t changed enough to evade vaccines or to cause severe illness in unvaccinated children, Antia said. If the virus changes significantly, a new vaccine using the technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna shots could be produced in 110 days, a Pfizer executive said Wednesday. The company is studying whether annual shots with the current vaccine will be required to keep immunity high. One plus: The coronavirus mutates at a slower pace than flu viruses, making it a more stable target for vaccination, said Ann Marie Kimball, a retired University of Washington professor of epidemiology. So, will the current pandemic unseat the 1918-19 flu pandemic as the worst in human history? “You’d like to say no. We have a lot more infection control, a lot more ability to support people who are sick. We have modern medicine,” Kimball said. “But we have a lot more people and a lot more mobility. … The fear is eventually a new strain gets around a particular vaccine target.” To those unvaccinated individuals who are counting on infection rather than vaccination for immune protection, Kimball said, “The trouble is, you have to survive infection to acquire the immunity.” It’s easier, she said, to go to the drugstore and get a shot. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy in Indianapolis contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The company said it will seek emergency use authorization and shots could be available as soon as Halloween. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The news is a ray of hope for some parents with younger children. Children now account for one in four new cases and the Delta variant is sending more kids into the hospital than at any other time in this pandemic. “Anything that’s going to protect the children is always gonna be good news for me,” said Alexis, a parent of two children under the age of five. Pfizer used a smaller dose of the vaccine for children in their trial and found it to be “safe and well-tolerated, resulting in robust neutralizing antibody responses,” according to a statement from the company released Monday. Now, it will send their results to the FDA and other regulatory agencies for vaccine approval. “If the FDA looks at this data and feels confident that it demonstrates this vaccine is safe and effective for children five to 11, you could have a vaccine within a month to 6 weeks,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Former FDA Commissioner. And it’s not a moment too soon. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “So many parents are waiting exactly for this news, especially given what’s happening now with the Delta variant…..there have been nearly half a million new cases in children in the last two weeks,” said Dr. Lena Wen, Public Health Professor at George Washington University. Many parents are now breathing a sigh of relief, like Wiley. “Anything is better than nothing,” he said, who plans to give his son the vaccine as soon as it becomes available. But for Christina, another parent, this trial doesn’t provide enough evidence. “I’m not giving my kids the vaccine,” she said. “Because I don’t feel like it’s been fully tested.” The vaccine has already been approved for children 12 years old and older but as cases surge among younger children, Doctor Aziza Shad the Chair of Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital At Sinai said a vaccine will keep kids out of the hospital “Having a vaccine that’s approved by the end of the year could prevent so many children from getting really sick from COVID in the early parts of next year,” said Dr. Shad. If the regulatory review with the FDA goes anything as it did for adults and older kids, which took about a month, millions of children could begin receiving their shot around Halloween.

She’s seen patients die and has grown weary of celebrities like rapper Nicki Minaj spreading unsubstantiated rumors about the dangers of vaccinations. Minaj made headlines last week when she noted in a tweet to her more than 22.6 million followers that the Met Gala required attendees to be vaccinated, and that she wouldn’t get the shot until “I feel I’ve done enough research.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured She later issued a tweet sharing an unverified story about a cousin’s friend in Trinidad. Minaj asserted the unidentified individual “became impotent” and “his testicles became swollen” after receiving the shot. “This is a tough topic,” Liu told CBSN Bay Area. “I have patients who have taken their time to get vaccinated and some of them eventually come around and some of them have died of COVID. When our unvaccinated patients died of COVID despite our best efforts to get them vaccinated, or to treat them even after they have gotten the infection, it’s really horrible.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I blame the widespread lies and all the falsehoods and misinformation that people are fed. It’s very upsetting,” Liu added emotionally. “People who have huge audiences are on social media are casting doubts on topics that there is better information to be found on. The people we are seeing in the hospital with COVID are either unvaccinated or their immune systems are such that they cannot respond to the vaccine. And it is really devastating.” When it comes to Minaj’s fertility claims, Lui said the science simply doesn’t support them. “Up front, we have to say there are many causes of infertility and testicular swelling. The COVID vaccines are not on that list,” she said. “There is still a lot to be discovered whether the COVID infection can actually affect your fertility. The jury is out on that.

In tonight’s episode, titled “Blind Spots,” Kelly Olsen assumes the role of Guardian. Azie Tesfai, who plays Kelly Olsen, also wrote this episode marking the first time an actor has written for a Greg Berlanti show. CBS ‘ Matt Weiss spoke to Tesfai about her groundbreaking opportunity and what it’s like to become a superhero. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW-  Hello Azie! Congratulations on the new episode of  Supergirl  coming out tonight on The CW at 9/8c. You got the opportunity to become the first actor to actually write an episode for a Greg Berlanti show for this one. How does that feel? AT-  I didn’t know I was the first until I was well into writing it, which is probably a good thing. It’s amazing. I had a really lovely conversation with Greg after and I feel very lucky that I got to be the first and that this character, specifically becoming a superhero and stepping into her power, It all feels very serendipitous. I feel lucky that I get to be the person to do it. MW-  How do you think it would have been different if you had known? AT-  Yeah, probably a freak out or two [Laughs]. This is a lot of pressure, I wouldn’t have wanted to mess this up. I can’t be the last and so I if I don’t get this right I could be. I don’t want to mess this opportunity up or somebody else coming in and saying I want to write and they’re like, we’ve tried this, we’re not doing this anymore. I had already written a sample script for  Supergirl  that I sent to my show runners and they loved it and sent it to Warner Brothers and our producer Greg Berlanti, and they signed off on me writing an episode. I also did the writers room for a month. So I joined the writers room and did the whole 10 to five day, which I’m a big fan, especially during COVID, because we did a virtual writing room. So I was in my pajamas like, constantly and then just put some sort of sweater that felt presentable and had all my food and my snacks and my dog. It was like a dream, I’m like, I could live this, [Laughs]. Like I don’t know why I’m going to set and getting my hair makeup done every day, I could do this. But so that was amazing and then I found out that I was going to write the episode and actually become a superhero; that just blew me away. Then I found out I was the first one to write an episode. So it was good it didn’t all happen at the same time because I think I might have just not been able to go through the process the same way. MW-  That’s a good point it’d be scary to know all that ahead of time. You’re the first and you don’t want to be the last. When you get to set and it’s time to shoot the episode what was that like putting on the suit for the first time? AT-  Emotional, which I was very surprised by the first time you put on your own supersuit it’s like a power you didn’t know you had. You just stand a little taller, it really is a game changer in your confidence, you walk differently. It’s not a normal thing to go to work and put on a superhero suit. Laughs]. So I think I underestimated how how special it was. Our team was wonderful and allowed me to be involved in the design process of the suit. To actually also see it in its final form from the animation that we started with was incredible. We had started two years before initially, before COVID, and then we had six full months to actively develop it with the studio here in LA. We worked with Ironhead who also did the Wonder Woman costume and Batman and I was geeking out non stop pretty much of how cool the process was to make a suit. MW-  Was it a different experience on set for an episode you wrote yourself? AT-  It was very shocking and jarring in the best way. I think from the beginning of writing it to being there on set, just even little things like the signage of a store. I would be like oh my gosh I came up with that! Then I’d take 100 selfies and photos with it. It was very surreal the whole thing. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn MW-  That’s really funny you got this job as an actor, you write an episode, become a superhero; but when you look back it’s the improvement in your posture and the prop store signs you were most excited about [Laughs]. AT:  [Laughs] Everyone thought I was nuts but it is a wild thing to think of a name of something and then see it. It really was a dream come true. MW-  You mentioned you collaborated on the design of the suit. So what parts of the suit were specifically you? AT-  The hair makeup we worked really closely together and so doing the braids was something that I felt lucky that we had an idea with it and they approved it right away. I always wanted to do the half helmet because of the comics and the gold. The gold was pretty quickly approved and then the half helmet logistically, there were concerns like can we do this? Doing stunts and stuff in this but Ironhead was amazing, they figured it out. Then once we had that foundation and the character was visible there were all these other little things that I wanted to do. Things like little gold pieces, the braids, and little accents. They really let me go for it and loved all of the ideas. The costume designers really were great at making it usable too because that’s something I hadn’t thought about. Thing like wearing it after lunch, having interview at home, or like, if I decide to hydrate that day making sure it’s gonna like a lot to take off. You sit in that costume for like 15 hours every day and I was one of the last costumes that needed to be developed so I got the benefit of taking care of all the issues everyone else had for mine. I am by far the most comfortable person on set like, I feel great [Laughs]. So I was very lucky to have my superhero suit come later because I got to benefit. It’s like being the youngest child, like, you know, they figured it out. And then you’re hopefully less damage. Maybe MW-  Your castmate’s pain was your testing ground [laughs]. Last question before I let you go for everyone who’s so excited to finally see you in the costume and to see you as Guardian; what message do you have for the fans? AT-  Man, I hope that you enjoy the episode a lot of hard work went into making it. It’s incredibly personal. A lot of the words that [Kelly] says I wrote with the feelings that I have. It was very, very personal. I felt empowered stepping into being a superhero and I hope that a lot of our fans see themselves in that character and feel empowered. MW-  Congratulations again Azie and looking forward to seeing those sign pictures on Instagram or something so we can all see them. AT-  I’ll start, I’ll post all 400 shots [Laughs] MW-  Lots of slides, can’t wait. Thank you and all the best! AT-  You too Matt, take care!

In a  letter Friday to Attorney General Merrick Garland and U.S. Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal , the five lawmakers asked Garland to reconsider a legal opinion issued under the Trump administration that would send as many as 4,500 people back to prison once the COVID-19 emergency passes. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “These individuals were transferred from correctional facilities to home confinement to stem the spread of COVID-19 after the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) determined that they did not present a danger to the public, but a Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion issued under the prior administration erroneously concludes that they will have to return to prison,” reads the letter signed by U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Reps. Kweisi Mfume, Dutch Ruppersberger and John Sarbanes. Correctional facilities and jails have been the source of outbreaks throughout the pandemic due to the large number of people living in close quarters, conditions that make it easy for contagious illnesses to spread. According to figures provided by the Bureau of Prisons,  more than 250 federal inmates and six BOP staffers have died of COVID-19 . The legal opinion issued by the Justice Department on Jan. 15 found the CARES Act gave the BOP the legal authority to release prisoners to home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic but only while an emergency exists. Once the national emergency ends, the memo states, the BOP is required to bring those prisoners back into its custody. “This OLC opinion incorrectly interprets the CARES Act, and we join Judiciary Committee Chairman (Sen. Dick Durbin) and Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism Chairman (Sen. Cory Booker) in asking you to direct OLC to review and rescind the memo,” said the letter, citing the lack of risk the prisoners posed to the public and the cheaper costs resulting from home confinement. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The letter pointed to the example of Ms. Gwen Levi, a 76-year-old Baltimore woman who served most of her 24.5-year sentence before being released to home confinement in June 2020. Levi was sent back to prison a year later due to a misunderstanding over halfway house rules because she did not answer her phone. Levi was later granted compassionate release despite the DOJ’s opposition. Levi recently described her experiences in an op-ed for  The Washington Post  in which she called for President Joe Biden to step in and keep 4,000 people on home confinement from going back to prison. “President Biden, please act now to keep these people home,”  Levi wrote in the July 15 op-ed . “They are doing everything right, yet they wake up every day not knowing where they will be in a few months, and that uncertainty makes it impossible to plan for their futures. Please remove that cloud. Commute their sentences now.” Citing Levi’s story, the lawmakers asked the BOP and DOJ to support compassionate release and prevent the re-incarceration of those transferred to home confinement.

But which treatments are best when it comes to fighting the coronavirus? KTVT-TV in Dallas went to Dr. Robert Gottlieb with Baylor Scott & White Research Institute to learn more about each. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “There are many therapies that work on paper, or even in the laboratory that don’t work when you bring them to a human.” said Dr. Gottlieb. “We have to remember that we’re not trying to treat a virus in a test tube, we’re trying to treat a virus in a human being.” At the beginning of the pandemic, doctors tried everything they could to save lives, including some treatments that are now proven not as effective as once thought. With more research, doctors now better understand which ones actually work, and have the science and data to back it up. “We’ve clearly studied hydroxychloroquine,” said Dr. Gottlieb. “We’ve shown that promise is a false promise, that is one of the best study things in the world, and it just doesn’t help for the virus.” Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Early studies showed promise in a laboratory setting, and doctors thought the drug could help keep people’s immune systems from overreacting, but Gottlieb said peer reviewed studies found that it does not benefit patients hospitalized with COVID-19. “We can draw a very complex pathway of why it should work, but we can’t will it into existence as an effective therapy. The data is the data,” he explained. A second treatment showing promise, at least for severe cases of COVID, is the antiviral drug remdesivir. “Remdesivir decreases duration of hospitalization, regardless of oxygen support level required in the hospital. It actually saves lives,” said Gottlieb. The drug received full FDA approval last October for use in adult and pediatric COVID patients 12 and older requiring hospitalization. It’s still being studied for outpatient use. Another potential treatment that’s receiving a lot of attention is ivermectin. It is FDA-approved to treat certain parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions like Rosacea. It also has shown some antiviral properties, but the jury is still out on whether it can be used as an effective treatment for COVID-19. Clinical trials are underway, but Gottlieb said it’s just too early to know if it’s helpful. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We haven’t completely disproved it, but we have no evidence at the moment of efficacy,” Gottlieb said. “So right now, we don’t know that answer. There’s no recommendation for it. I personally do not prescribe it.” Human-grade ivermectin requires a prescription, but it also a drug that’s used for animals. Because of its popularity on blogs and social media, there were reports of people raiding feed stores to buy the animal-grade version. Gottlieb said that is dangerous and could keep someone from getting a treatment that is proven to work. “If someone thinks that they’re being protected by ivermectin and they’re not, you’re really just prescribing them a version of a placebo and losing the opportunity to actually get treated with an effective therapy,” Gottlieb said. “From that standpoint, it really is harmful, because it gives the illusion of protection.” The most promising treatment at the moment in an outpatient setting is monoclonal antibody therapy. “If you have one or more mild symptoms, it doesn’t matter how mild they are, those are the patients we studied, and we showed that we could prevent 70 to 87% of those patients from being hospitalized,” said Gottlieb. “We could actually save lives, if used early.” Gottlieb said there’s three different manufacturers, and there’s no comparative efficacy data. He said the one that’s on the shelf in your healthcare system is the appropriate one. Various centers have opened all across Texas to provide the therapy free of charge. The doctor said outside of clinical trials, it’s important to stick with what we know will work. “Even as I conducted the research, I was really convinced that  therapy X  or  therapy y  would really work,” Dr. Gottlieb explained. “When we’ve actually wrapped up the study and actually determine who’s who, I’ve been very humbled by that answer.” Another type of medication Gottlieb said is proving helpful, and is also cheap and readily available: corticosteroids. They’ve been shown to be beneficial for hospitalized patients needing oxygen, but can actual be harmful for those who are not in that situation.

He also said there’s nothing wrong with taking vitamins D and C or a multivitamin. He said while they may not really have an effect on the virus, there’s really now downside and they can make you feel more positive.

(WJZ) —  Families in Anne Arundel County are feeling what is being called a nationwide school bus driver shortage. Some say the shortage is being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tuesday, dozens of families were impacted because of the shortage. READ MORE:  School Bus Driver Shortage Continues To Impact Maryland Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman is calling the issue a crisis and said county buses in Annapolis are now offering to transport students to school for free. “We’re into the first month and here we are starting it out like this, it’s terrible,” said Ryan Brooks, parent of AACPS student. It’s an ongoing problem continuing to affect families. “I got an email saying that bus routes are going to be shorted because we’re short bus drivers,” said Brooks. School districts are in desperate need of bus drivers. “It is a market issue, a labor market issue and we need to get more people driving buses, get them trained, get them hired,” said Pittman. In Anne Arundel County, some parents report their children have been left stranded at bus stops due to no drivers showing up. “So they get marked absent, they get punished for it and it’s not their fault,” said Brooks.

County and school officials said they’re working to fix the problem. “I will be meeting with the contractors myself asking the question, what will it take to get them the incentives, any bonuses they need to be able to hire the drivers they need, we’re expediting that,” said Pittman. It’s not just in Anne Arundel County, Howard, Harford, and Baltimore Counties along with Baltimore City are also dealing with a shortage of bus drivers. “I don’t know what they plan on doing but if they don’t plan on doing it and doing it right soon, it’s going to cause an uproar somewhere,” said Brooks. Governor Hogan is now calling on state agencies to expedite the licensing process for anyone who wants to be a school bus driver.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .07% to 4.37%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by one to 824. Of those hospitalized, 623 remain in acute care and 202 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 522,355 total confirmed cases and 10,104 deaths. There are 3,855,260 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,820,071 doses. Of those, 3,916,157 are first doses with 4,423 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,556,658 second doses, 5,694 in the last day.

The state reported 83% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state.

He said he and his wife—along with their children—recently tested positive. He said the symptoms are mostly mild. “Our 12-year-old who has asthma is just now starting to get better. She had four pretty rough days. She had a sore body, tightness in her chest,” the father said. Schisler told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren his children wore masks in school, even though Carroll County made them optional at the start of the new school year. “I think we started off not with the best foot forward. I think then the numbers slapped them in the face. Now, they’re understanding this is still here,” Schisler told Hellgren. Schisler believes his family contracted the virus through the schools. “Honestly, I believe that’s where it came from—especially the elementary school. Understand, it’s got to be very difficult to keep masks on kids in elementary school,” he said. Schisler said he may home school his children once they have fully recovered. “The other thing was people were pulled into thinking if you got the vaccine, you would not get covid. From what I’m seeing, a lot of people who were vaccinated are starting to get covid.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Maureen Aversa has two children in Carroll County schools who have been vaccinated. Still, she is concerned. She fought the school board’s decision to make masks optional, which state lawmakers later overruled. “What we want is a safe learning environment for our children,” Aversa told Hellgren. “Let’s think about how many kids we are putting out of school unnecessarily because this board wanted to wait and see what happens and because we’re different in Carroll County,” Aversa said. Lindsay Jensen pulled her two children out of Carroll County schools over concern about their initial lack of mandatory masking. She started a petition in favor of a school mask mandate that garnered more than  2,500 signatures. “I have no trust in our board of ed to do what is right by our kids,” Jensen told Hellgren.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The nursing profession, which was already stretched before the pandemic is now in greater demand than ever before. “I have seen ups and downs with the nursing shortage, but this is clearly the worse that I have seen it in four decades,” said Wiser. Doctors say there could be several factors behind this, from the baby boomer generation getting older to nursing burnout. “It has resulted in some nurses electing to leave the profession for the time, some nurses electing to become traveling nurses because financially, the compensation they receive is considerably more than what they receive as an employee in one of our hospitals,” said Dr. Jane Kirschling, Dean of University of Maryland School of Nursing. “This is rigorous… you’re always on and you have to be on point all the time, so that can be a stressful occupation and vocation after a while,” said Wiser. Doctors say the covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. “At one time that their work level may have been let’s say four patients, five patients, six patients, well now they’re taking up to ten patients over a 12-hour shift,” said Wiser. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Officials say the rising demand for patient care with not only unvaccinated patients due to the COVID-19 delta variant surge but also patients resuming non-elective surgeries and procedures put off since the beginning of the pandemic has put a strain on hospital systems dealing with a shortage of nurses. That’s why Notre Dame of Maryland University School of nursing is working to address the shortage by speeding up the process to become a nurse through an accelerated program to help students like Kathryn Newsome earn a nursing degree in just 15 months. “Being in the medical field is always something I wanted to do,” said Kathryn Newsome, nursing school student at Notre Dame of Maryland University. University of Maryland School of Nursing officials are also seeing a strong applicant pool and admission numbers. They say their goal is to keep graduates in state to practice. “Nursing gives you flexibility, it gives you very much a livable wage, it gives you the opportunity to care for people at some of their most vulnerable times of their life,” said Kirschling. For Newsome, the shortage of nurses is a trend she hopes will turn around as more people recognize the importance of the profession. “I just want to make a difference and Be able to help people who are in need,” said Newsome.

Researchers wanted to know what role our breathing plays in the spread of this virus. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “The virus is evolving to get better at airborne spread, it’s getting out into the air better,” said Dr. Donald Milton, one of the researchers who conducted  the study at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health . The researchers found variants are spreading better among people after testing 49 COVID-infected people. “People sit with a cone in front of their face that is collecting all of the air coming from around their head,” Dr. Milton explained. The cone is called Gesundheit TWO and it measures how much virus is in their breath. The test was conducted with people’s masks on and with their masks off. And the results show that those with a variant were breathing out more virus. “Eighteen times more in the air,” added Dr. Milton. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Anne Simon was among those tested and said she was shocked at how much COVID was coming out of her. Simon caught COVID while outside at her farm sitting next to someone who was infected. “We eat outside occasionally together and little did we know one Sunday afternoon, one of us had COVID,” she said. Within the first few days of getting sick, Dr. Milton tested Simon for the study. “Without a mask, just breathing normally, talking softly, they were able to measure a substantial amount of COVID on droplets,” said Simon. Dr. Simon said as the virus gets better at getting into the air, the public needs to be better about keeping it out of the air. While the study revealed that masks cut down the spread of the virus by half, Dr. Milton said with variants becoming more airborne, masks should be worn tighter around the face. For example, the big difference between a surgical mask and an N-95 is that surgical masks have room around your face for the virus to get in and out, Dr. Milton explained.

The data comes as flu season is around the corner, which could increase death tolls and put more strain on hospitals already struggling with an influx of patients and depleted resources. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured More than 312,000 people have initiated the vaccination process — gotten their first shot — over the last week, CDC data shows. That’s a 7% drop from last week and a 35% drop from the previous month. The average number of all doses given each day, including second doses, was 742,703 over the past week — 19% below where it was at the start of this month but still higher than the end of July. About 182 million people, or 54.9%, of the US population, are fully vaccinated, the data shows. That leaves 71 million people, or 25.1% of the eligible population, who are not vaccinated. “We are bracing ourselves for an awfully busy winter ahead,” Dr. Megan Ranney, associate dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, told CNN on Tuesday. The country is once again at a point where an average of more than 2,000 people are dying of Covid-19 every day, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University. And hospitals are straining to keep up with the number of patients coming in. Staff shortages and employee fatigue in Pennsylvania hospitals have reached a point where some health systems are offering signing bonuses, loan forgiveness and other incentives to staff. In Wyoming, nearly 100 members of the state’s National Guard were activated Tuesday to assist hospitals dealing with the surge. And though it isn’t clear yet what this year’s flu season has in store, it could add additional stress to an already pressed health care system. “Flu is still a killer, not as much as Covid-19, but between 12,000 and 50,000 Americans lose their lives every year from flu,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Flu numbers were actually relatively low last year, but experts said that doesn’t necessarily foreshadow how this year will turn out. “Let’s be clear on why flu cases were so low last year, it’s because we were all masked and we were all distancing,” Ranney said. “Those things are not being done anymore in the vast majority of the country.” Vaccines are the surest way to get the pandemic under control, experts have said, but rates are still lower than they need to be. Health officials are now asking the public to get both their Covid-19 vaccines and flu shot. Pediatricians recommend that both adults and children 6 months and older receive their flu vaccinations by Halloween, Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children’s Hospital, told CNN. Some vaccine clinics around the country are offering both shots — and encouraging people who come in for one to make sure they have the other. “If somebody comes in wanting the flu vaccine and they haven’t had a Covid vaccine then we can encourage them to get both, or vice-versa,” said Dr. Robert Hopkins, chief of general internal medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and chair of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee. If health care providers can encourage people to do both, “We potentially are going to have a greater impact on both disease prevention efforts,” Hopkins said. Two-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine 94% effective, company says Pfizer has suggested a third dose of its vaccine will boost protection for those already vaccinated, and now Johnson & Johnson has announced an extra dose of its vaccine is helpful as well. A two-dose version of the vaccine provides 94% protection against symptomatic infection, the company said Tuesday — making a two-dose regimen of J&J’s Janssen vaccine comparable to a two-dose regimen of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine was given emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration on February 27. It has been given to about 14.8 million Americans, according to the CDC. The company released some details of three studies looking at various aspects of its Janssen vaccine, and said that, taken together, they showed the vaccine provided long-lasting protection that could be boosted with an extra shot. “Our single-shot vaccine generates strong immune responses and long-lasting immune memory. And, when a booster of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is given, the strength of protection against COVID-19 further increases,” Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of Janssen Research & Development, said in a statement. The company’s ongoing Phase 2 trial of a two-dose regimen showed giving two doses 56 days apart provided 100% protection against severe Covid-19 and 94% protection against moderate to severe Covid-19 in the US. A second study showed people given a booster shot six months or longer after their first dose had a 12-fold increase in antibodies — compared to a four-fold increase for people who got a second dose at two months. So, protection should be stronger if people get boosters later, Dr. Dan Barouch, head of Beth Israel Deaconess’ Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, told CNN. The protection provided by Covid-19 vaccines appears to wane over time, especially for people 65 and older, a CDC expert said Wednesday. “For individuals 65 plus, we saw significant declines in VE (vaccine effectiveness) against infection during Delta for the mRNA products,” said Ruth Link-Gelles, who helps lead the CDC’s Vaccine Effectiveness Team. Link-Gelles reviewed a series of studies looking at the overall effectiveness of vaccines in various groups between February and August and found similar patterns for Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, both made using mRNA. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is meeting to discuss the potential need for booster doses of vaccines, and is discussing vaccine effectiveness and safety in general. The committee will be back at 12 p.m. Thursday now that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it would grant emergency use authorization for a booster dose of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine in people 65 and older, people at high risk of severe disease and people whose jobs put them at risk of infection. Death rate four times higher in least vaccinated states The average rate of Covid-19 deaths in the 10 least vaccinated states was more than four times higher over the past week than the rate in the 10 most vaccinated states, according to a CNN analysis. In the least vaccinated states, roughly eight people out of every 100,000 residents died of Covid-19 over the past week, compared with only about two out of every 100,000 people in the 10 most vaccinated states. CNN used data from Johns Hopkins University and the CDC for the analysis. Less vaccinated states tend to have higher hospitalization rates, too. The latest data from the US Department of Health and Human Services shows an average of 39 Covid-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 people in the 10 least vaccinated states, nearly three times higher than the average rate of 14 per 100,000 people in the 10 most vaccinated states. The states with the lowest vaccination rates have fully vaccinated less than 45% of their residents. They are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming. The 10 states with the highest vaccination rates have fully vaccinated more than 62% of their residents. They are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .01% to 4.38%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 32 to 792. Of those hospitalized, 610 remain in acute care and 182 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 523,760 total confirmed cases and 10,120 deaths. There are 3,860,068 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,829,889 doses. Of those, 3,919,875 are first doses with 3,718 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,561,005 second doses, 4,347 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 299,063 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 461 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 83.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

A judge heard from attorneys for both the Commonwealth and the State Police Association of Massachusetts in Suffolk Superior Court.   The union, which represents 1,800 members, argues that the state needed to bargain with workers before implementing the mandate, which states that 44,000 executive department employees must show proof of vaccination by October 17 or risk losing their jobs.   They also argued that by putting that deadline in place, it essentially precludes members from getting the two dose Moderna shot, and will shortly rule out the two-dose Pfizer vaccine as well, leaving members with just the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as their only option.   The troopers’ union asked the judge for an injunction to pause the mandate.   The Commonwealth says it did negotiate with the union and that potential penalties for failing to meet the mandate can be ironed out after the deadline.   “There has to be situations where there is an ability of the government, in an exigency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to have a deadline of implementation of policy,” said Jennifer Greaney, an attorney for the Commonwealth.   In general, Boston University health law professor Michael Ulrich says the state has the authority to implement a vaccine a mandate.   “As we’ve seen, states have broad authority to mandate vaccines in general, but also with state employees. And then, really with police, you have an even stronger argument because, one, they have to be out in public,” Ulrich said.   The judge did not issue her decision at Wednesday’s hearing, but said she will make it promptly.   According to the attorney representing the union, roughly 20-percent of State Police employees remain unvaccinated.   The union filed a lawsuit September 17 to get Baker to delay the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.   The union wants members who’ve previously had COVID-19 or who choose not to get the vaccine for either medical, religious, or personal reasons to be able to take a weekly test and wear a mask on the job.   They’re also requesting that if a member contracts COVID-19, becomes ill from the vaccine, is forced to retire because of coronavirus, or if they were to die, that it be considered a “line-of-duty” injury.   If they’re not given time to negotiate, the lawsuit argues, it could result in “irreparable” harm to troopers.",0.03479166666666668,0.43104166666666666,403,2021-10-12T06:31:31+00:00,2021-09-23T14:00:03+00:00,2021-09-23T14:00:03+00:00

The mRNA vaccines are not only safe for pregnant women, they also protect their newborns. READ MORE:  Ravens Donate 500 Tickets To UMMS To Attend Tonight's Game Against The Colts It has been one of the most worried-over issues in the COVID vaccine debates — is the vaccine safe for pregnant women? If so, when should she get the shot? And of course, is the vaccine safe for the unborn baby? We now have answers. As CBS New York’s Dr. Max Gomez reports, in a study just published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology-Maternal Fetal Medicine, NYU researchers measured antibody levels in pregnant women who had been vaccinated and later measured those antibodies in their newborns. “When the baby is born, we call it a neonate, and they had not only antibody, but very high levels of antibody, which means that the infant will be protected for several months of life,” said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, with NYU Langone Health.

Importantly, doctors were also able to distinguish between antibodies from the vaccine as opposed to antibodies from a previous  COVID  infection. Bottom line? “Vaccination affords protection not only for the mother but for the infant as well that you’re saving. You could possibly be saving two lives with vaccination,” Lighter said.

For 23-year-old Sara Wilson it was a quick trip to paradise as she was the first member of the Ua tribe voted off following  Eric Abraham ‘s elimination from Yase earlier in the episode. CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to Wilson about living out a dream getting to the island and the pressures of puzzle building. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Full Survivor 41 Episode One Recap MW-  Hello Sara, I know you’re probably not happy to talk to me, at least not this early on in the season but it’s nice to see you! SW-  [Laughs] No it’s all good, nice to see you too! MW-  You know you did accomplish something that not many people have or ever will just getting on the show. As you look back on your experience how do you feel even making it to the island? SW-  It’s been a lifelong dream of mine and even though it didn’t end the way it hoped I think back to the moments of getting the call I made it on, sitting on those boats going to the shore and those are now some of my core top 10 memories; no one can take that away from me regardless of that outcome. Honestly going during COVID too we didn’t know if it was even going to happen. It could have easily not happened so I’m just so blessed and thankful to have been a part of it and that we were able to go out there. MW-  When you arrived on the island and took that first step on land what’s that moment like? SW-  Honestly surreal. I mean I’m looking at the boat, I’m looking at Jeff Probst! I’m like, this is Jeff Probst, that’s him! I’m not kidding I couldn’t believe this was actually happening it’s so surreal. It was a moment I thought about and was waiting for my whole life and I’m so happy it happened. MW-  Obviously you’re a huge fan so you were familiar with the same, how did you prepare? SW-  I’m a big athlete, I was a water polo player and a swimmer so I really banked on that. I was like if there’s just one swimming challenge I’m the girl for it; obviously you didn’t really get to see me use it so that was sad. The mental preparation was there too though, I felt really solid about my strategies to be honest. I knew how I wanted to play the game and it’s also really hard to strategize beforehand because so much of it is dependent on the whole cast and who’s on your tribe. It was also really about mentally preparing myself because I hadn’t left LA in the entire year of the pandemic. Now all of a sudden I’m being flown out to Fiji, it was very jarring. I just prepared myself for that and prepared myself for any of the outcomes that could have happened. Going out at the first tribal was like worst case scenario, but I feel like I set myself up nicely to know I can handle this. MW-  I hate to bring this up but clearly the puzzle during the immunity challenge was an issue. There are a lot of people at home who couch quarterback and say ‘if I was there I could have done it’ or ‘how hard can it really be’. Now that you’ve been in those shoes, what’s it like being in that high stress situation and trying to fit all those pieces together? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn SW-  You know, it felt like it was going well. Chen was emptying and I was putting them in and we had a  really good rhythm with it, then all of a sudden it just melted. It’s hard because I’m so competitive and there’s so much pressure with Jeff Probst screaming at you, your teammates are trying to scream at you from behind you and it’s so hard to stay level headed. For us that one piece was so integral to connect the puzzle, it was a very difficult puzzle. I knew something was wrong and it was just hard to get past that. I feel like. But like you said as someone who is good at puzzles, I’ve definitely watched the show and thought it’d be easier. When you get out there you realize, oh my gosh, it’s way harder than it looks I promise you. MW-  And then the chaos didn’t stop there. You go a live tribal council and everyone is trying to figure out what to do next, what’s going through your mind as everything is unfolding all around you? SW-  Honestly the live tribal was the best thing that could happen for me because the vote was pretty much locked on me before we went to tribal. I went into that tribal thinking, I’m 100% going to play my shot in the dark because I don’t have any other chance. Then I kind of got this idea before tribal I mentioned to Chen and Ricard maybe let’s do Brad. Brad had put our names out and someone literally tells someone they’re going home isn’t someone you can work with in the long term. I was really trying to pitch for it because I felt like that was the only person I had leverage against. Nothing against Brad, I just needed it to be anyone but me. When the whispers were happening, out of the back corner of my eye I saw Chen whisper to Ricard saying Brad. I knew they weren’t lying to me but I also knew I wasn’t safe. MW-  When that torch goes out and your time in the game is over did you at least take some solace being that close to Jeff as a big fan? SW-  I didn’t even like acknowledge him [laughs]. I felt like I was so dazed, honestly I feel like I blacked out. I was just like is this really happening? You don’t come to  Survivor  to get voted off one the first council, it’s very disappointing. I was very heartbroken, I was upset, but I knew someone had to go home. I feel like I carried myself with a lot of elegance, a lot of poise and it just is what it is. I’m still very proud of myself! MW-  I think I know the answer to this already but given the chance, would you go back out there? SW-  Is that even a question?! Of course! [laughs] Going out there and getting voted out early, it sucks but it’s not the end of my story, it’s the beginning. It’s literally given me so much fire on the inside, I am just chomping at the bit to get back out there. MW-  Happy to hear it, you represented yourself very well out there and I’m sorry the game came to an end so soon but hopefully we’ll see you back out there. Thanks for the time Sara and all the best moving forward! SW-  Thank you so much, you too!

The hardest part, Lee says, is knowing that new deaths could have been prevented. “Initially seeing all the people when there were no vaccines come in and die in front of you, feeling like you can’t help them was what I think we initially thought was the darkest time,” said Lee. “But now that the vaccine is out there and we’ve started to make a break-through and unfortunately back-sliding.” Gray had simple advice for those who aren’t yet vaccinated.

Larry Hogan on Thursday announced the state is taking action to shore up the medical workforce.","BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  With  Maryland’s hospitals grappling with staffing shortages , Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday announced the state is taking action to shore up the medical workforce. As part of the effort, Maryland is removing roadblocks that kept nurses who are licensed in other states from providing nursing care here. Besides that, the state is asking nursing programs to let select nursing students graduate as soon as possible. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “This week, Maryland reported the nation’s lowest COVID-19 rate, and we continue to withstand the Delta variant surge better than just about any other state,” Gov. Hogan said. “While our hospitalizations remain well below all of our pandemic surge capacity triggers, we are taking proactive steps to maximize the ability of our hospitals to increase their nursing workforce.” Moving forward, the Maryland Department of Health will  allow registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who hold active licenses in other jurisdictions to practice in Maryland , a measure backed by the state’s Board of Nursing. In addition, the Maryland Higher Education Commission is encouraging nursing programs statewide to let qualified nursing students “exit early” and enter the workforce. This can be done either by letting students take exams sooner, streamlining the final weeks of the semester or advancing high-performing students. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We want to be clear about what exactly early exit is and is not,”  MHEC Secretary James Fielder wrote in a letter Thursday to nursing schools’ deans and faculty . “Early exit is not a change in the curriculum. All learning outcomes, course objectives, and program outcomes must be preserved.” Dennis Shrader, secretary for the state Department of Health, is also encouraging hospital leadership and schools to collaborate on ways to maximize the use of nursing students and waiving the license requirement for students enrolled in physician assistant students to practice. The goal of these steps, Hogan said, is to give hospitals more flexibility to deal with staffing needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “We have worked closely with our hospitals, healthcare associations, and many others in the state on this solution that will further our ability to continue to provide quality care to Marylanders,” Shrader said. “Nurses and student nurses have been invaluable in our fight against COVID-19 and so much more and these steps will ensure that hospitals can use all available nursing solutions.”",0.13273809523809524,0.44761904761904764,425,2021-10-12T06:31:34+00:00,2021-09-23T13:41:28+00:00,2021-09-23T13:41:28+00:00

During an August press conference, Gov.

The state reported 83.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday.

You’re an idiot.'""","LOVELAND, Colo. (CBS)  – As the delta variant of COVID-19 surges throughout the country, hospitals in northern Colorado are among those that are  at or near capacity in their ICUs . And now, for the first time since being released from the ICU, one of Larimer County’s sickest patients is sharing his story in hope of bringing greater awareness of the virus to those who doubted its severity.   (credit: CBS)   Tom Schneider, a Loveland, Colorado resident, admitted he was among the biggest skeptics of the severity of COVID-19 and the safety of getting a vaccination. Schneider, 51, said he originally elected to forgo the vaccine until further research and development was completed.   “I didn’t know anybody that has been in hospital, I didn’t know anybody that had had side effects from COVID,” Schneider told KCNC-TV’s Dillon Thomas. “I wasn’t pro-vax, I wasn’t anti-vax. I was going to wait and see which one does better.”   But in early August, Schneider started feeling sick, as did his fiancé. He tried to battle his illness with over-the-counter medications. However, the symptoms continued to worsen. He eventually, and reluctantly, decided to go to the hospital. But, when he arrived, doctors told him he needed to be admitted.   Schneider said he chose, against medical advice, to go back home. He said he was fearful of the decisions the medical staff told him he would have to make if his symptoms evolved to a state in which left incapacitated.   He went home. And the next thing he remembered was waking up in the hospital. “I felt good one day and 24 hours later was in the hospital, intubated for four weeks,” Schneider said.   Schneider had passed out in his home. His fiancé found him, called 911 and had him transported for treatment by ambulance at McKee Medical Center in Loveland. “I just crashed, no energy, couldn’t breathe. Lethargic,” Schneider explained. “I was way not prepared to face that at all.”   (credit: CBS)   Placed on a ventilator for a month, Schneider said he couldn’t help but to spend some of his waking moments reconsidering his decision to not be vaccinated. He said he believed the virus was real but thought battling it would be easier if he ever contracted it. “It’s like a Monopoly game. And I think a lot of people are playing from GO to GET OUT OF JAIL,” Schneider said. “I didn’t realize that there were three other sides to this game. Being ventilated, long-term life effects and death.”   Locked away in an ICU without ability to see or thoroughly communicate with his loved ones, Schneider couldn’t help but to compare his experience battling COVID-19 with that of his fiancé’s. Schneider said his fiancé felt ill for less than a week and was able to quickly return to work. Meanwhile, he lost his job and was stuck battling for his life in the hospital.   Schneider thought back on his time helping the Army Corps build the overflow hospital facility at the Larimer County Fair grounds just a year prior. He said he couldn’t help but to think about how he once downplayed the severity of the virus.   “I look back and go, ‘You’re an idiot. You’re an idiot,'” Schneider said.   Thanks to medical professionals with Banner Health and Columbine Health Systems, Schneider was able to get out of the hospital. He is now being cared for in a rehab facility near his home. He expects to go home in the coming week.   As a Christian, Schneider said he mistakenly believed he could place God’s protection ahead of the virus. However, in the end, he said he realized God’s protection came after contracting COVID-19.   “It was stupidity and arrogance on my part. I’m a Christian, and one of the lessons that I learned was I was expecting God to show up and keep COVID from me. But God had me at the hospital getting treatment,” Schneider said. “He had me there with the people who needed to take care of me.”   (credit: CBS)   He said he was thankful to both God and the medical professionals who helped him for giving him a second chance at life. Though once a skeptic of the COVID-19 vaccines, Schneider said he now plans to get his vaccination once he is healthy enough to do so.   Looking back on his comparison of Monopoly and the battle with COVID-19, he hoped sharing his story would encourage others to realize the “game” is harder to play than they may realize. “Now that I’ve lived it, 75% of the game is detrimental. I don’t like those odds,” Schneider said. “You could get this and you could be dead tomorrow.”",-0.00895238095238096,0.3446428571428571,776,2021-10-12T06:31:41+00:00,2021-09-24T14:41:52+00:00,2021-09-24T14:41:52+00:00

Current vaccinations and immunity from infection help prop this possibility. Still, he says, vaccination rates need to get “higher if we want to create a backstop against the kind of spread that we’ve seen this past summer.”   He pointed to  CDC data  showing 76.7% of adults having received at least one vaccine dose. “We really need to get to around 80% to 85% to have enough vaccination in the population that you start to see case rates decline and the velocity of spread start to slow,” Gottlieb said.   Though national daily cases are inching downward for over a week, the overall Delta-influenced wave isn’t done and cases still may spike — especially as colder weather approaches, and especially in regions like the Northeast that haven’t been as hard hit as other places, he said.   “I think we’re going to see infections start to pick up here (in the Northeast), as well, as kids go back to school, schools become sources of community transmission, and people start to go back to work and the weather gets cold,” Gottlieb said.   “I think we’re still going to have a lit of cases this winter. … It likes to spread in the cold weather,” he said.   He painted a picture of what living with Covid-19 could look like once the wave diminishes, if no other variant pierces immunity.   “This becomes a more persistent, endemic risk. So, you continue to have coronavirus spread, but not the same rates we’re seeing right now, and it settles into … more of a seasonal pattern, and basically becomes a second flu, (but) probably more pathogenic than the flu,” Gottlieb said.   “The challenge is that we already have a flu, and if we have Covid circulating alongside flu, the cumulative death and disease caused by those two pathogens is going to be too much for society to bear,” he said.   So society still will have to do things differently, especially in winter, he said. That includes improving indoor air quality and filtration, making offices less densely populated, and wearing masks at least voluntarily in public spaces.   “I think you’re going to see masks become much more culturally acceptable and used in parts of the country,” he said.   Coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations jumped after the early summer, as the highly contagious Delta variant became dominant, though cases and hospitalizations have recently dipped.   The country averaged more than 130,790 new Covid-19 cases each day over the past week as of Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s down from the summer 2021 peak average of 172,001 daily reached September 14, but still is more than 11 times what the figure was two and a half months ago.   More than 86,920 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Thursday — a number that has dropped in recent weeks, but is still significantly higher than early summer, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.   Across the country, nearly 80% of ICU beds are in use — more than a quarter of those taken up by Covid-19 patients, according to the  Department of Health and Human Services.   Pace of first vaccine doses is the slowest in two months   Despite the call from health care professionals for the public to get vaccinated, the current pace of people receiving a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine is the slowest in two months, according to CDC data.   Meanwhile, federal health officials are considering expanding the groups of people eligible for boosters. Last month, the CDC recommended an extra dose of Covid-19 vaccine for some immunocompromised people.   On Wednesday, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine booster for people 65 and older, people at high risk of severe disease and people whose jobs put them at risk of infection.   Vaccine advisers to the CDC will meet Thursday to act on the FDA’s decision. The CDC must give its stamp of approval for any booster doses to be officially given.   Some schools up preventative measures, others dial back   Another consideration in managing the virus is the return of children to in-person learning, which schools are handling differently.   Some schools have amped up Covid-19 preventative measures as more students have been infected across the country.   In South Carolina, the Charleston County School District began fully enforcing its mask mandate Wednesday — and as a result, a number of students were sent home for not complying, district spokesperson Andy Pruitt said.   Students who don’t come back to school adhering to the new policy will learn virtually until at least October 15, though they are welcome to return to the classroom wearing a mask, he said.   Elsewhere, precautions are being eased.   In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a revised rule for the school year under which parents can send asymptomatic children exposed to Covid-19 back to class.   The policy, which some educators opposed, recognizes that quarantining healthy students is “incredibly damaging” for students’ educational advancement and disruptive for families, he said.

According to that bulletin, Marylanders are not required to provide proof of eligibility. It states, “Any Marylander who presents to a provider that they are eligible for an additional dose or a booster dose shall be allowed to self-attest to that eligibility. Providers shall follow CDC guidelines when developing their own procedures to allow for self-attestation of patient eligibility. However, providers shall not turn away any individual who self-attests to eligibility for an additional dose or booster dose. Failure of an individual to ‘show proof’ of eligibility shall not be a reason that a provider does not administer an additional or booster dose.” The decision to include higher-risk workers comes after some disagreement among government health officials. On Thursday, a panel of CDC advisers voted against boosters for frontline workers and others with higher risks of infection in their workplaces, but CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky disagreed. Her decision effectively cleared booster shots for people in “high-risk occupational and institutional settings” as well as other groups. Governor Hogan said the approval for the Pfizer boosters is long overdue. “We are encouraging providers to conduct outreach to previously vaccinated individuals. If you received your second Pfizer dose at least six months ago, you should strongly consider getting a booster shot,” he wrote in a statement.   The governor authorizes booster shots for eligible people in Maryland  @wjz   pic.twitter.com/DIbu4ryxDb   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  September 24, 2021 Hogan, a cancer survivor, revealed to CBS News one month ago that he received his third dose. Since August, people who are severely to moderately immunocompromised have been able to get the third shots. That group includes transplant recipients and others with severely weakened immune systems. Maryland has already administered 51,704 additional doses to those who are fully vaccinated. 1,754 people got their additional shots in the past 24 hours, according to the Maryland Department of Health. Still, state officials said the priority remains convincing the unvaccinated to get the shot. 86-year-old Jay Towson Smith is one of them. “I’m a little skeptical on the effect the vaccines will have on my medications and heart conditions,” he told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren. He said he would be more likely to get the vaccine if it was mandated for him. Here are the frontline workers and other types of employees who qualify for a booster shot, according to the FDA and CDC: READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Health care workers  Teachers  Day-care staff  Grocery workers  Emergency responders This means that grocery store workers, teachers, nurses and other workers who fall under these categories can now make an appointment at a pharmacy or another vaccine provider and get a third dose. Booster shots are free of charge, with no ID or insurance card required, said Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response coordinator in a Friday briefing. National pharmacies such as CVS Health and Walgreens say they are ready to start administering booster shots based on the CDC’s latest guidance. There are roughly 80,000 locations across the U.S., including more than 40,000 pharmacies, where people can get boosters, Zients said. CVS also said it will be ready to provide boosters at its pharmacies and select MinuteClinic locations starting Friday. “We have the experience and the infrastructure to play a leading role in administering booster shots to eligible populations,” Troyen A. Brennan, chief medical officer of CVS Health, said in a statement Friday. Patients are encouraged to schedule appointments to ensure access to the correct vaccine, a CVS spokesperson said. If the new rules outlining worker eligibility for boosters are broad, that’s by design, said Dr. William Moss, head of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It was left deliberately vague and ambiguous about who fits into the category of people who should get a booster dose because of their occupational setting,” Dr. Moss said. He doesn’t expect the FDA to offer more specifics on what kind of worker may now get a third shot. “I do not think this authorization will have that level of specificity.” Regulators are still reviewing a submission by Moderna, which sought permission last week for booster shots of its vaccine at 50 micrograms—half the dose of its first two shots. Johnson & Johnson has yet to announce an application for approval of a second dose for its vaccine, though federal health officials say they expect the submission soon. Meanwhile, research backed by the National Institutes of Health examining the safety and efficacy of so-called “mix-and-match” boosting has yet to release results. Regardless, federal health officials said the initial series of doses—two for Pfizer and Moderna, or one from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine—would still be sufficient everyone to be considered “fully vaccinated.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “FDA is working closely with Moderna and J&J to get and process their data as quickly as possible, with a goal of making booster recommendations for Moderna and J&J recipients in the coming weeks,” Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told reporters on Friday. “This is a high, high priority.”",0.09107535438417792,0.41157218190306416,965,2021-10-12T06:31:46+00:00,2021-09-24T23:33:25+00:00,2021-09-24T23:33:25+00:00

COVID put the kibosh on that in 2020 and organizers feel it’s still not safe enough to gather.

He’s a regular at Baltimore’s Madonnari Arts Festival and festivals around the world. “Oceanus, as you know, is the god of all water, the ocean, and he was a benign god in mythology–he didn’t take sides,” said Wolf. “And we think that’s where Baltimore should be.” “The symbolism of the Trevi Fountain is, when you’re leaving Italy, if you sit on it and toss a coin, it means you’re going to come back. And we always want to come back to our culture and our heritage,” said Lou Mazzulli.

Using spray paint for the first time, he constantly consults his rendering, and is learning to deal with a brick surface.

The question is not what has gone up, but what hasn’t. Eggs, beef, chicken, are seeing significant increases this past year. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured And the answer to most questions these days: COVID is the driving force. “Everything is high. Nothing has gone down,” said Chris Jones of Baltimore. “Chicken, pork,” added a woman named Mildred who lives in Baltimore. “Boneless chicken breasts have gone up,” said Edward Brown of Baltimore. Said Robin Price of Baltimore: “Don’t try to buy chicken wings.” “Beef,” Jones added. “From eggs, right up to soup,” Mildred said. Those shoppers Friday outside the Howard Park Shop Rite have taken notice. “Everything has increased. Except for the paychecks.” Price said. Added Jones with a chuckle: “The only thing that hasn’t increased is Oodles and Noodles. That’s the only thing that’s stayed the same.” Grocery prices everywhere are skyrocketing the past year. Meat, eggs and fish, particularly, are on the rise. “They’ve changed a lot. They’re getting higher and higher,” Jones said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Prices are far outpacing paychecks and inflation. “I used to buy aluminum foil for $12.99. It’s now $17.99. Bacon was $23. It’s now $27,” Price said. Karyl Leggio, a finance professor in the Sellinger School of Business at Loyola University Maryland, agreed prices are rising. “When I look at the cost of meat and poultry going up 4.4 percent last year, that’s a lot. That’s a big increase in one year,” she said. Some products are not even getting to stores, Leggio said. “Pretty much anything produced overseas. We’ve had a terrible time with supply chains,” she said. The economy is pretty good in spite of COVID, and we’re not likely to go back to pre-pandemic grocery prices. “The supply chain is broken by the fact factories are closed, certainly. It’s broken by the transportation issue. But, it’s also broken by the excess demand,” Leggio said. Demand, Leggio said, is the biggest impact on increased prices. COVID has changed people’s behavior, and more people are cooking. When asked when there might be relief, Leggio said with a laugh: “When will we see no more COVID?” Shoppers at the Shop Rite said much the same thing. “COVID is worldwide, so it’s affected everything,” Brown said. Said Jones: “I would usually cook. Nope. Everybody’s gonna have to bring a dish now.

The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .11% to 4.39%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 23 to 749. Of those hospitalized, 563 remain in acute care and 186 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 526,690 total confirmed cases and 10,140 deaths. There are 3,872,477 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,857,205 doses. Of those, 3,930,125 are first doses with 5,557 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,572,465 second doses, 6,134 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 300,012 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 399 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state has administered 54,603 additional vaccine doses, 2,899 in the last day. The state reported 83.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state.

I mean we already do flu shots yearly so at this point, if booster shots or covid shots, vaccines is going to be an annual thing, then that’s just what it’s going to be,” said Syeda Saibat Popoola-Sampson, parent. “One of the key elements of patrolling variants is to have high levels of vaccination,” said Thierman. But what if you are fully vaccinated and not eligible for a booster yet? Dr. Thierman says even if you are fully vaccinated and did not get a COVID-19 booster shot, you are still extremely well covered for running into risk of severe illness and death. He recommends following your primary physicians’ guidance and waiting until a booster is ready for you. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “To kind of cut the line and get a Moderna booster when you’re not really supposed to yet, or switch vaccines and get a Pfizer when you had Moderna, these are not good ideas,” said Thierman. With the new school year underway, doctors say the outcome has been positive so far. “It really does seem to work that the kids are being masked in the classroom,” said Thierman. ” I’m hopeful we don’t have the mass closing of the schools like we did last year.” This comes as multiple vaccine makers are working around the clock to get FDA approval for a shot that is both safe and effective for all children. “I think it’s great and if they can do it, you know the younger the better, just to protect them, why not,” said Bella Batra, parent. “The more people that are vaccinated, the more your family, the community and the whole society is safe from the virus,” said Thierman.

(AP)  — With more than 40 million doses of coronavirus vaccines available, U.S. health authorities said they’re confident there will be enough for both qualified older Americans seeking booster shots and the young children for whom initial vaccines are expected to be approved in the not-too-distant future. The spike in demand — expected following last week’s federal recommendation on booster shots — would be the first significant jump in months. More than 70 million Americans remain unvaccinated despite the enticement of lottery prizes, free food or gifts and pleas from exhausted health care workers as the average number of deaths per day climbed to more than 1,900 in recent weeks. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Federal and state health authorities said current supply and steady production of more doses can easily accommodate those seeking boosters or initial vaccination, avoiding a repeat of the frustratingly slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines across the country early this year. “I hope that we have the level of interest in the booster … that we need more vaccines,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday. “That’s simply not where we are today. We have plenty of vaccines.” Robust supply in the U.S enabled President Joe Biden this week to promise an additional 500 million of Pfizer’s COVID-19 shots to share with the world, doubling the United States’ global contribution. Aid groups and health organizations have pushed the U.S. and other countries to improve vaccine access in countries where even the most vulnerable people haven’t had a shot. Among the challenges states face is not ordering too many doses and letting them go to waste. Several states with low vaccination rates, including Idaho and Kansas, have reported throwing away thousands of expired doses or are struggling to use vaccines nearing expiration this fall. While most vaccines can stay on the shelf unopened for months, once a vial is opened the clock starts ticking. Vaccines are only usable for six to 12 hours, depending on the manufacturer, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Moderna vaccines come in vials containing 11 to 15 doses. Pfizer vials contain up to six doses and Johnson & Johnson vials five doses. “We are going to see more doses that go unused over time,” said Wisconsin’s health secretary, Karen Timberlake. “They come in multidose files. They don’t come in nice, tidy individual single-serving packages.” State health officials said they have tried to request only what health care providers and pharmacies expect to need from the federal supply. Those numbers have dwindled since the vaccines became widely available in early spring. But U.S. officials — holding out hope that some of the unvaccinated will change their minds — are trying to keep enough vaccines in stock so all Americans can get them. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn That balancing act is tricky and can lead to consternation around the globe as the U.S. sits on unused vaccines while many countries in places such as Africa can’t get enough vaccines. “Somebody sitting in a country with few resources to access vaccines, seeing people in the U.S. able to walk into a pharmacy and get that vaccine and choosing not to, I’m sure that’s causing heartache,” said Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, which represents the public health agencies of all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, said officials anticipate that on-hand doses of COVID-19 vaccines and manufacturers’ ability to supply more will meet needs across the country. “I think states have tried to plan as if everybody’s going to be offered a booster,” he said, suggesting they will be overprepared for the more narrow recommendations issued by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California, for example, estimated earlier this month that it would need to administer an extra 63 million doses by the end of 2022 — if initial shots for children under 12 were approved and boosters were open to everyone. U.S. health officials late Thursday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine for all Americans 65 and older — along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs. California, with nearly 40 million residents, has the lowest transmission rate of any state and nearly 70% of eligible residents are fully vaccinated. That leaves nearly 12 million people not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated. Dr. Mark Ghaly, California’s health secretary, said the state will rely largely on pharmacies and primary care providers to give boosters to seniors while some large counties and health care groups will use mass vaccination sites. In Pennsylvania, more than 67% of residents older than 18 are fully vaccinated. Alison Beam, acting secretary of health, said health authorities now have “two missions”: Continuing to persuade people to get vaccinated and serving those eager to receive a booster or initial shots. “Pennsylvania is going to be prepared,” Beam said. “And we’re going to have the right level of vaccine and vaccinators to be able to meet that demand.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The CDC on Friday approved a third shot of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine to an expanded group of Americans. “Starting today, if you are six months out from your last dose of the Pfizer vaccine, you are eligible for a booster if you fall into one of three high-risk groups,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said during a briefing. “Number one: You are 65 or older. Number two: You have a medical condition that puts you at high risk of severe illness with Covid and these conditions include obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and others. And Number three: You work or live in a setting where you are at high risk of exposure to Covid. This includes health care workers, teachers, those living in shelters or prisons and grocery store workers,” Murthy said. Boosters have not yet been endorsed for the two other vaccines offered in the US — those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Health officials are working to determine next steps for recipients of those vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration “is working with Moderna and J&J to get and process their data as quickly as possible with the goal of making booster recommendations for Moderna and J&J recipients in the coming weeks,” Murthy said. Walensky acknowledged that even with more Americans becoming eligible for Pfizer boosters, the country must ramp up initial vaccination numbers for the pandemic to subside. “I want to be clear: We will not boost our way out of this pandemic,” she said Friday. The US has fully vaccinated more than 55% of all residents as of Friday,  CDC data  shows, while 75% of the vaccine-eligible received at least one dose of inoculation. A recent CNN analysis showed the average rate of Covid-19 deaths in the 10 least vaccinated states was more than four times higher over the past week than the rate in the 10 most vaccinated states. CDC vaccine advisers had recommended that Pfizer booster shots should be made available for people over 65 and those with health risks — stopping short of expanding that threshold to include those who may be disproportionally exposed to the virus at their jobs. But Walensky moved to account for the occupational exposure group in her guidance. “Some people really voted … with enthusiasm to say our health care workers, our frontline workers, people who were vaccinated early, people who work in congregate settings, in correctional facilities, grocery workers, really do merit the vaccine,” Walensky told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday. “The question wasn’t ‘yes or no,’ the question was ‘wait or do now,'” she added. Ultimately, the decision for boosters was about “providing rather than withholding access” and the need to protect society as a whole, Walensky said. Pfizer boosters are ready now The boosters are already available, with CVS Health announcing Friday that nearly 6,000 of its locations started offering appointments for a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Those who choose to go for the booster shot will be asked to “self-attest to their eligibility” outlined by public health officials, CVS said. They also must be recipients of Pfizer’s initial two doses. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn In California, Los Angeles County on Friday also began offering the booster shots to its residents who show proof of vaccination and affirm their eligibility, the county’s public health department said in a news release. Many schools closed due to Covid-19 outbreaks, study finds The headaches facing school officials and parents were underlined in a study released Friday on the impact so far of the pandemic on in-person learning. About 1,800 schools closed between August 1 and September 17 because Covid-19 cases were detected, which affected the education and well-being of 933,000 students, according to the  CDC study . Nearly 60,000 teachers in 44 states were also affected by closures, and the number of closures was highest in the South, the study found. Examining data from 8,700 districts nationwide, the CDC study found that “the largest number of districts with full remote learning (14) were in the West Census Region, followed by the South (11). Seven Midwest and two Northeast districts offered full remote learning.” The study noted that the timing of return to school may be a factor in school closures because the schools in the South returned earlier in August than other parts of the country– which typically start in late August or early September. Covid-19 outbreaks forced 300 Tennessee schools to close, the study shows, noting that was the most in the nation– followed by Georgia, Kentucky, Texas and South Carolina. The CDC recommends that people in schools wear masks even if they’re vaccinated as well as screen testing and physical distancing to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. New York prepares for hospital staffing shortages ahead of Monday vaccine deadline New York state is bracing for potential staffing shortages at hospitals and long-term care facilities ahead of a Monday deadline for workers there to get  at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine . The state health department issued the deadline in mid-August. As of Wednesday, 84% of all hospital employees in the state had been fully vaccinated, along with 81% of staff at all adult care facilities and 77% of all staff at nursing home facilities. Percentages for those who had at least one dose were not immediately available. On Saturday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a plan to address any staffing shortages that result from the deadline. She said she was prepared to sign an executive order, if necessary, that would allow health care professionals licensed in other states or countries, recent graduates, and retired professionals to practice in the state. Other options, Hochul said, include deployment of medically trained National Guard members and partnering with the federal government to deploy disaster medical assistance teams to assist.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,114 new COVID-19 cases and 15 new deaths, according to state health department data released Sunday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .18% to 4.22%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 5 to 754. Of those hospitalized, 569 remain in acute care and 185 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 527,804 total confirmed cases and 10,155 deaths. There are 3,877,040 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,868,834 doses. Of those, 3,933,935 are first doses with 3,810 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,576,656 second doses, 4,191 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 300,384 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 372 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state has administered 57,859 additional vaccine doses, 3256 in the last day. The state reported 83.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only approved for children 12 and older, which has stirred concern among health experts as cases in children increase, school years begin and the more transmissible Delta variant spreads. Nearly 26% of all Covid-19 cases nationwide are reported in children, according to recent data published by the  American Academy of Pediatrics.  And an average of 266 children were hospitalized with Covid-19 every day last week, according to Sunday’s data from the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). Once the data from Pfizer/BioNTech is in, it will have to go through two committees, one for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and one for the CDC, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Johnathan Reiner said Sunday. If the data comes in this week, it would likely be in committee by the end of October, he added. And there is a lot of data for them to look at, he said. “This is a vaccine for children, so getting the dose right — in terms of efficacy and side effects — is crucial,” Reiner said. But even when a vaccine becomes available, a difficult task lies ahead in getting children vaccinated. Less than half of US adolescents are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data. In response, officials need to do a better job educating the public about the importance of vaccination for the health of their children and their families as a whole, Reiner said. “If you want kids in school, the best way to keep them in school is to keep them from getting Covid,” he said. Until vaccines are approved for younger children, the CDC has recommended mask wearing for students, teachers and visitors in schools from kindergarten through grade 12, along with improved ventilation, physical distancing and testing on a screening basis. “We know how to keep them safe,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CBS Sunday. “When we don’t use the proper mitigation, they’re more likely to have outbreaks.” Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said he encourages parents to vaccinate their children when they can. “This is a dangerous pathogen,” Gottlieb told CNN. “I wouldn’t be so cavalier about this virus, we know that this virus has long-term consequences in a lot of people who contract it, including children.” Current surge likely to die down by Thanksgiving, Gottlieb says Gottlieb predicted Sunday the current surge of coronavirus spread is likely to worsen across parts of the country and then die down by Thanksgiving. “I think you’ll see a wave of infection sweep across the Northeast as kids go back to school, the weather turns cold and people move indoors,” Gottlieb told CNN’s Pamela Brown. The virus won’t be gone, Gottlieb said, but hopefully it will reach more manageable levels — which he estimates to be about 20,000 cases per day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn According to the CDC, the current seven-day average for new cases in the US is more than 114,000 new cases a day. The decline in cases will likely come from most people attaining immunity to the virus, Gottlieb said. “Some people will get a vaccination; some will challenge their immunity by no choice but getting the infection,” Gottlieb explained. “People who choose to go unvaccinated, they’re going to be vulnerable to getting infected through this Delta wave.” As the US moves into flu season, Gottlieb said the demand for tests will pick up as people and their doctors try to determine if their flu-like symptoms are due to Covid-19 or influenza. “That’s why it’s so important to get diagnostic tests into the hands of consumers and doctors’ offices as well, things like where people can test in the home will make a difference between telling between Covid and other respiratory infections, especially as the flu picks up,” Gottlieb said. But even if Covid-19 cases do come down by Thanksgiving, health experts are bracing for a difficult winter ahead. It isn’t clear yet what this year’s flu season has in store, but it could add additional stress to an already pressed health care system. “Flu is still a killer, not as much as Covid-19, but between 12,000 and 50,000 Americans lose their lives every year from flu,”  said Dr. Peter Hotez , vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Last year’s flu numbers were low, which health expert say could mean that upcoming seasons may be worse, as there has been little accumulation of immunity. “We’re in for a whopper of a flu season at some point,” Gottlieb said Sunday. Recommending booster for frontline workers a ‘scientific close call,’ CDC director says On Friday, Walensky recommended a booster dose for adults at occupational risk of infection — in addition to those with underlying conditions and those over 65 — a decision she said was a “scientific close call.” “And because of that close call, and because of all of the evidence we reviewed at the FDA and the CDC, I thought it was appropriate for those people to be eligible for boosters,” Walensky told CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday. “So who are those people? People who live and work in high-risk settings. That includes people in homeless shelters, people in group homes, people in prisons. But, also, importantly, are people who work with vulnerable communities, so our health care workers, our teachers, our grocery workers, our public transportation employees,” Walensky said. Although the CDC’s vaccine advisers voted against recommending booster doses for people at high risk of infection because of their work or living conditions, Walensky went with the FDA’s authorization including those people. The recommendation is not currently intended for the wider population, but there’s little fear of causing dangerous side effects from adding that third dose, Walensky said. “We have an extraordinary amount of safety data,” she said.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 42 to 796. Of those hospitalized, 604 remain in acute care and 192 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 528,764 total confirmed cases and 10,166 deaths. There are 3,877,649 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,869,687 doses. Of those, 3,934,179 are first doses with 244 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,576,898 second doses, 242 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 300,751 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 367 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 57,859 additional or booster vaccine doses, none in the last day. The state reported 83.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

(WJZ) —  A federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging a 45-yeard-old Bowie man with federal wire fraud and money laundering charges. The nine-count indictment charges Rudolph Brooks with three counts of wire fraud relating to Brooks’ transmission of loan applications submitted through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) in the names of three entities controlled by Brooks. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The indictment shows that Brooks submitted PPP loan applications in the name of Cars Direct, Madaro, and Kingdom Tabernacle containing false statements about the number of employees and payroll expenses. He also submitted false tax forms, not on file with the IRS. In total, Brooks obtained at least $3,560,855 in PPP loan proceeds.  He used the PPP loan proceeds for his personal benefit and on payments and purchases not permissible under the Paycheck Protection Program. This includes payments for a residence, the purchase of a luxury vehicle, purchases at restaurants, retail stores, grocery stores, cash withdrawals and transfers to other bank accounts controlled by Brooks. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The indictment also charges Brooks with three counts of money laundering for wire transfers from the criminal proceeds of the PPP loans. These were used for the purchase of a 2018 Tesla Model 3, a real property in Baltimore, Maryland, and a real property in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. In total, the United States has recovered more than $1.6 million in proceeds of the fraudulent PPP loans as well as a 2018 Tesla Model 3 purchased with proceeds of the Cars Direct PPP loan.  If convicted, the United States will seek forfeiture of the seized property as well as the Upper Marlboro, Maryland property purchased with fraud proceeds. Brooks faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for wire fraud and money laundering followed by three years of supervised release if convicted.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Among those positive, a 12-year-old student is currently hospitalized from COVID-19. The Dixon family carpools regularly with the student. “And her mom contacted us and said she has it, and she was in your car around your children. You might wanna get your kids tested.

The Delta is variant pushing up case numbers among the unvaccinated. President Biden is instituting  stronger efforts to encourage vaccines, as the rise in cases slows the economy’s improvement. Some segments of the population have yet to experience any real improvement. Unemployment still exceeds pre-pandemic levels, even with jobs widely available in certain sectors. The federal unemployment bonus ended on Labor Day. Millions of people remain short of food and behind on bills. A fourth stimulus check could help those still struggling to make ends meet. A few places, including California, have recognized that need for additional help and stepped up with additional payments. But will the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) come through with another stimulus check in 2021? That question has no a definitive answer yet. But plenty of clues point where things are heading. Economic Recovery For Some READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Relief payments were intended to ease COVID’s economic impact and support the economy in the process. The third round of relief payments started back in March, courtesy of the American Rescue Plan (ARP). Over the following months, about  169 million people  received up to $1,400 each. That accounts for nearly all of the $422 billion set aside. The ARP checks closely followed the $600 payments from January, which came nine months after the $1,200 payments from the pandemic’s early days. They seem to have worked, but have also helped many who didn’t actually need the money. In the second quarter of 2021, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of  6.5 percent , according to the advance estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. ( Supply shortages  may have prevented even faster growth.) That continues the torrid pace from the first quarter, which saw 6.4 percent growth. The  Conference Board  forecasts continued though slower growth through the rest of the year. The country’s  gross domestic product  (GDP), an estimate of economic activity across the U.S., has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. By that general measure, the economy has already recovered. Broad segments of the workforce have endured little economic hardship during the pandemic. Many jobs performed at a desk in an office are just as easily performed at a desk in someone’s home. And with fewer places to spend money during much of the pandemic, plus three stimulus checks, many Americans saved more than they might have otherwise. The personal saving rate ballooned to 33.7 percent in April of 2020 and has remained well above pre-pandemic levels ever since. In July of 2021, it sat at  9.6 percent , still above the 8.3 percent from February of 2020, the month before the pandemic started. On  Face the Nation  back in June, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan  estimated  that its customers had not spent 65-70 percent of their last two stimulus checks. That extra savings combined with pent-up demand has likely helped drive the broader economy during the rebound. The  housing market  has also surged, thanks to low interest rates and people stuck at home realizing the limitations of their living space. The National Association of Realtors recently reported that the national median sales price for an existing home hit $356,700 in August, up 14.9 percent from August of 2020. Much of that rise was helped along by houses priced above the median. Housing inventory decreased over July, and was down 13.4 percent year over year. And of the homes that sold in August, 87 percent were for sale for less than a month. The stock market continues to perform well too. The Dow Jones remains far above where it was at this time last year. It regularly sets new record highs, or at least approaches them. The market opened Tuesday morning at 34,747 as compared to 27,584 around this time a year ago. Concerns about the Delta variant and lagging vaccination rates in parts of the world still linger. COVID case numbers continue to rise, and mask mandates have come back into effect in many parts of the country, thanks to the Delta variant. But the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) full approval of the Pfizer vaccine, along with the approval of booster shots for those at risk or over 65 yeas old, has been good news for the market. Individual investors who saved their stimulus cash remain invested. Bigger investors continue to bet on a strong economic recovery in the months ahead. While certain experts foresee some of the strongest economic growth in decades, many are also worried about higher inflation. August projections indicate that prices will rise about  5.3 percent  in 2021. That’s compared to the 2.3 percent rate in 2019 and 1.7 percent rate in 2020. The latest data shows prices rising  5.3 percent  over the last 12 months. Should that rate persist for the rest of the year, it would be the highest in three decades. That possibility has become less likely of late. Prices moved up 0.3 percent in August, a slowdown from previous months. Core consumer prices — excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile — rose only 0.1 percent. Nevertheless, rising prices continue for many products that require semiconductors, including new cars, computers, and TVs. Price hikes and product shortages stem, in part, from the economy opening up all at once. Prices depressed by the pandemic have had to normalize. But companies couldn’t keep pace with a year’s worth of pent-up consumer demand. They also have had to revive and retool their supply chains in the midst of drastic changes in consumer demand patterns. And this has all happened as shipping issues and other constraints continue to slow production and delivery. COVID has altered how and what people consume. The way these changes continue to play out isn’t necessarily predictable. Companies, however, have had to guess where demand for their product will be when all the dust settles. Predicting the future is hard enough in a normal economy. It became much harder in an economy trying to move past a pandemic then forced to deal with a resurgence. Price changes and shortages across a whole range of products will likely continue to plague consumers in the short-term. But economists think they should improve with time. Consumer spending  is starting to slow, with the rate down to 0.3 percent in July, as compared to 1.1 percent in June. Demand for travel and leisure is starting to ease. The same goes for spending on various goods, resulting from all the shortages. New car purchases continue to be a drag, with semiconductor shortages still creating production and supply issues. Overall, goods spending remains above pre-pandemic levels, but could also be showing the effects  Delta variant  concerns. No Economic Recovery For Others The pandemic has further highlighted the growing imbalance across the broader economy. While many households have financially flourished during COVID, many others have fallen behind where they were in early 2020. Much of the gap depends on whether wage earners could work remotely during the shutdown or had public-facing jobs that required them to be on-site. Financial insecurity is still widespread, and the loss of a job and the loss of hours have been some of the main reasons over the course of the pandemic. Nine percent of American adults (approximately 18 million people) reported a  shortage of food  in their household over the previous week, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of U.S. Census survey data from late August. Approximately 15 percent of renters (10.7 million people) have fallen behind on their rent, including 22 percent of renters with children in their household. The federal  eviction moratorium , which has been extended until October 3, doesn’t forgive rent that is owed, it pushes the debt into the future. And  evictions continue  in some parts of the country regardless. Meanwhile, only a fraction of the $46 billion Congress allocated for rental assistance has actually made it to tenants and landlords. As of late August, over a quarter of American adults (60 million people) reported some difficulty keeping up with expenses in the prior week. Employment also remains below pre-pandemic levels. About  5.3 million  fewer workers are on payrolls than before the pandemic. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent in August, but job growth slowed dramatically. Forecasters expected roughly 750,000 new jobs last month, but employers only added about 235,000. (July saw about 1 million new jobs.) Many fear the rise of the Delta variant is hindering growth. Low-wage jobs made up the bulk of those lost during the pandemic, and while plenty of openings have returned, many remain unfilled. Approximately  351,000 people  initially applied for unemployment insurance in the week ending September 18. (A typical pre-pandemic week saw about 250,000 new unemployment applications.) The approximately 4.9 million people previously collecting PUA  lost benefits  on September 6, when the program ended. As of the week ending September 4, over 11 million workers were receiving some form of unemployment aid. Many jobless Americans have not received unemployment insurance and other government benefits, because of long waits, perceived ineligibility and other issues. Job growth still faces some headwinds, aside from the Delta variant. Some have argued that overly generous benefits made unemployment more attractive than working. But other considerations factor into one’s ability to work too. Remote schooling created childcare issues for many parents, and summer break didn’t necessarily change anything. The resumption of in-person learning, if it lasts, could free up some parents to return to work. The full vaccination rate is  55.3 percent  for the country. But state percentages range from 69.3 percent in Vermont to 40.4 percent in West Virginia. Many counties across the country have vaccination rates lower than that. The threat of COVID, particularly the now-dominant Delta variant, is still real in places. Many people are uncomfortable working in public around strangers. The number of people remaining unemployed because of  COVID concerns  in the first two weeks of August grew 30 percent to 3.1 million, according the Census. A gap between labor force skills and job requirements can make hiring more difficult, not to mention the rising standards of what workers will accept in a job. And then there’s the general friction that inevitably arises when an entire economy slams its foot on the gas. As before the pandemic, many who are willing to work cannot find jobs with the wages and benefits they need to survive. According to  Marie Newman , a U.S. Representative from Illinois, “there is not a shortage of Americans looking for work, there is a shortage of Americans willing to work for starvation wages with no benefits, no health care, and no protections during a pandemic.” About half of all states tried to force the issue and push people back into the job market. These states, most led by Republicans, discontinued the $300  federal unemployment benefit bonus  for their citizens ahead of the official Labor Day end date, or at least attempted to. Analysis from a payroll services company called  Gusto  showed that cutting off federal benefits didn’t lead to  more hiring . The federal unemployment bonus and the previous round of stimulus checks have helped Americans still awaiting their recovery to pay bills and put food on the table. The advance Child Tax Credit provides some additional support to families. But this money only goes so far. And some politicians feel that the payments haven’t been enough. Support For A Fourth Stimulus Check A group of Democratic Senators, including Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, sent a  letter to President Joe Biden  at the end of March requesting “recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions.” As the Senators reasoned in their letter, “this crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. Families should not be at the mercy of constantly-shifting legislative timelines and ad hoc solutions.” An earlier letter to  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris  from 53 Representatives, led by  Ilhan Omar  of Minnesota, carved out a similar position. “Recurring direct payments until the economy recovers will help ensure that people can meet their basic needs, provide racially equitable solutions, and shorten the length of the recession.” Additional co-signers included New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib, two other notable names among House Progressives. The letter didn’t place a number on the requested stimulus payments. But a tweet soon after put it at $2,000 per month for the length of the pandemic.   $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic is over.  https://t.co/6tuia6prFJ   — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN)  January 28, 2021 A  May 17 letter  from members of the House Ways and Means Committee renewed the push for additional stimulus. “The ARP’s $1,400 checks alone will keep 11 million people out of poverty this year, with UI (unemployment insurance) expansion and other provisions in the bill accounting for the another five million. A fourth and fifth check could keep an additional 12 million out of poverty. Combined with the effects of the ARP, direct payments could reduce the number in poverty in 2021 from 44 million to 16 million.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn There’s also been talk about  automatic payments  that could be sent when specific economic metrics reach certain thresholds (for example, if unemployment rises to 6 percent). These triggers would make stimulus checks a reactive force in countering economic dips, sparing struggling Americans from Congressional delays. A majority of Americans also favor recurring relief payments. According to a January poll from  Data For Progress , nearly two-thirds of all voters support $2,000 monthly payments to all Americans for the length of the pandemic. Supporters include a majority of Independents and Republicans. A struggling restaurant owner’s  online petition  calling for $2,000 monthly payments for every American adult has surpassed 2.9 million signatures. The  Urban Institute  estimated that another stimulus payment could reduce poverty by at least 6.4 percent in 2021. Many economists are also onboard. A 2020  open letter  from experts in the field argued “direct cash payments are an essential tool that will boost economic security, drive consumer spending, hasten the recovery, and promote certainty at all levels of government and the economy – for as long as necessary.” California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a  new budget  into law in July, which includes a stimulus check for about two-thirds of the state’s residents. The $100 billion California Comeback Plan, as part of their  $262.2 billion budget , is paying $600 to residents earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year. Residents in that income range who have kids are receiving $1,100. Those checks  started going out  the last Friday in August The state’s previous stimulus went to those with an annual income under $30,000. Other states have also authorized payments.  Maryland handed out  $300 or $500 checks to those who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on their tax returns.  Florida gave  $1,000 bonuses to teachers, which started showing up in August. Denton and Irving school districts in  north Texas  were scheduled to give retention bonuses of $500 and $2,000 respectively at the start of the school year. The Biden administration is also planning to give a one-time  $600 payment  to farm workers and meatpacking workers. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the plan in early September. The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated up to $700 million for the limited-scope stimulus check. The aid will be handed out through state agencies and include a pilot program giving extra money to grocery store workers. The Biden administration, which authored the third round of stimulus checks, isn’t against a fourth round. But the president recognizes their high price tag. He also has other priorities, specifically infrastructure and help for families. Neither the American Jobs Plan nor the American Families Plan, the administration’s original infrastructure and human infrastructure proposals, included another relief payment. Other plans currently bouncing around Congress don’t either. A Fourth Stimulus Check Is Unlikely All of the tacit and explicit support for stimulus checks keeps the possibility alive. The support doesn’t make a fourth payment likely, however. And there are many reasons why. Vaccinations are progressing steadily, albeit not as quickly as in the spring. Adults and those at least 12 years old are eligible to be inoculated in all 50 states. (Trials for children under 12 continue with approval expected mid-winter.) Three different options are available to the public, with the Pfizer vaccine fully approved by the FDA. Booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine have also been approved for those at risk or over 65. Actually putting needles in arms is taking time, even with supply readily available. Americans have received over 390 million doses, with 64.4 percent of the population having received at least one dose and 55.4 percent completely vaccinated. Vaccination numbers continue to increase at a rate of close to 600,000 doses per day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its guidance and recommends that vaccinated people in areas with higher COVID transmission revert to wearing  masks indoors  again. With vaccinations rising, the nation’s economy continues to recover. Looser restrictions have helped businesses, and jobs are available in many sectors. Many industries are even complaining of worker shortages, which are leading to wage increases. The number of new unemployment claims remains lower than it has been for much of the pandemic. In August,  consumer confidence  dropped due to ongoing concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices. Similarly,  consumer sentiment  also fell off earlier in the month. Confidence, however, remains higher than it’s been for much of the pandemic. Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the country’s economy. And excess pandemic savings, along with three stimulus checks, has boosted people’s spending power. That spending power has increased even more since monthly Child Tax Credit payments started on July 15. The most recent payment went out September 15. An improved financial position generally also raises optimism for the future. The ongoing vaccinations, which have allowed the economy to reopen to some degree, certainly help. All that additional spending, along with the release of pent-up demand, has led to the availability of more jobs as companies try to hire to address consumer needs. With the economy growing, a fourth round of stimulus checks seems less urgent. Aside from the generally improving economy, the political machinations of Washington make a fourth stimulus check a longshot. The American Rescue Plan, which included the third stimulus check, passed along party lines. Republicans were not interested in spending anywhere close to $1.9 trillion, though some did support the third relief payment. They termed the package a “blue state bailout,” claiming it went well beyond the scope of COVID and would increase the deficit, leading to inflation. The Democrats used a process called  reconciliation  to pass the bill in the Senate without Republican support. That allows budget-related matters to proceed with a simple majority rather than the filibuster-proof 60 votes. Generally only one reconciliation bill can pass per fiscal year. But a subsequent ruling by the  Senate parliamentarian , who interprets the legislative body’s rules, opened up a path for additional spending legislation. Without reconciliation, any bill would need at least 10 Republican votes, along with every Democratic vote. But the Biden administration has other priorities. One of its biggest, aside from keeping the federal government open, is addressing infrastructure. The proposed  American Jobs Plan , which aimed to rebuild roads, repair bridges, do away with lead pipes, extend broadband, modernize the country’s electric grid and much more, carried a price tag of $2.3 trillion. Biden and a group of Senators from both parties agreed upon a scaled-back infrastructure plan costing about $1 trillion. The resulting bipartisan bill, now called the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , passed the Senate in early August. Neither the original version nor the bipartisan bill that moved forward includes a fourth stimulus check. One could, in theory, be added when the House takes up the bill. That seems unlikely given the price tag. The American Families Plan, focused on childcare, education and more, would have cost another $1.8 trillion in its initial form. The Democrats are now pushing forward a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that focuses on their various “human infrastructure” initiatives, such as Medicare expansion, child care, and climate change. A fourth stimulus check is not included, though one could theoretically still be added as well. The Democrats’ extended plan is a more likely home for a fourth stimulus check than a traditional infrastructure plan. Funding these plans will almost certainly involve tax increases on corporations and wealthy individuals, which Republicans would oppose. Plenty more negotiating seems inevitable before any bill gets passed into law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised not to take up the infrastructure bill until the Senate also passes the human infrastructure bill. Democrats are already laying the groundwork to use reconciliation again to push through this legislation. Joe Manchin  of West Virginia, among the most centrist Democratic Senators, has warned against overusing reconciliation. He is also apparently unwilling to do away with the filibuster, which would lower the number of votes needed to pass legislation to 51. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema doesn’t want to abandon the filibuster either. Manchin also wants to see the human infrastructure bill shrink. With bipartisanship still hard to come by, the Biden administration is in a tough spot. They’re unlikely to add a fourth stimulus check to any plan, driving up the price tag by hundreds of billions of dollars. They’re also unlikely to use reconciliation to pass another stimulus check on its own. What Other Aid Is Out There? While a fourth stimulus check is improbable, more direct payments to Americans have already been signed into law. Up until Labor Day, the jobless received extended unemployment benefits. The American Rescue Plan also includes an advance Child Tax Credit. Under the revised Child Tax Credit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is paying out $3,600 per year for each child up to five years old and $3,000 per year for each child ages six through 17. Monthly payments of up to $300 per child started July 15 and will continue through December of 2021. The remainder is to be issued when the recipient files their 2021 taxes. The benefit does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. In other words, qualifying families will receive the full amount, regardless of how much — or little — they owe in taxes. Payments start to phase out beyond a $75,000 annual income for individuals and beyond $150,000 for married couples. The more generous credit will apply only for 2021, though Biden has stated his interest in extending it through 2025. The American Rescue Plan also extended the weekly federal unemployment insurance bonus of $300 through Labor Day. (As mentioned before, half of all states have ended the additional unemployment or or attempted to.) Those eligible for Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), which covered people who had used up their state benefits, and PUA had also seen their benefits extended through early September. The ARP also added $21.6 billion to the  Emergency Rental Assistance Program , which is being distributed to state and local governments, who then assist households. Most of the $46 billion total has yet to reach tenants and landlords. The infrastructure and human infrastructure plans also have the potential to create many jobs across a wide swath of the economy. How the proposed initiatives are ultimately distributed across the bipartisan bill or the broader Democratic plan remains to be seen. The American Families Plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave that could have reached as high as $4,000 per month, depending on a worker’s income. It also boosted the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and placed a ceiling on the cost of childcare for many families. The plan set aside $200 billion for universal preschool. In addition to helping working parents pay for childcare, the plan sought to allow more parents to return to the workforce. Look for similar programs and more when the specifics of the human infrastructure plan are worked out. Additional money in people’s pockets from any bill or proposed plan is still hypothetical, of course. Nothing has found its way through Congress yet. And it could be months until it does.

The seven-day average rate of people getting their first shot is 231,695, 31% less than last week, almost half — 47% — less than a month earlier — and a far cry from the  millions a day  the country saw in April. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured It’s not that there’s now a lack of people who are not immunized: Sixteen states have yet to vaccinate more than half of their residents, according to the CDC data, and almost 25% of the eligible population — about 70 million people — are not vaccinated. Just over 55% of the total US population is fully vaccinated. The number of people eligible to get a vaccine may soon be widening, though, and could boost the overall number. Pfizer/BioNTech plans to ask soon for authorization of a  Covid-19  vaccine for some children under 12, bringing the US one step closer to offering protection to a population that has grown particularly vulnerable as the fall season gets underway. “It is a question of days, not weeks,” Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla told ABC News on Sunday about when the company will submit data on children ages 5 to 11 to the US Food and Drug Administration for consideration. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Monday that the CDC will review data on vaccines for 5- to 11-year-olds with urgency. “We are all enthusiastically awaiting these data,” Walensky said, when asked how soon authorization and shots for kids could be seen after Pfizer submits its data. “As soon as they get submitted to the FDA, I know the FDA is urgently planning to review these data, it will go from the FDA to the CDC, and we will review it with similar urgency,” she continued. “And I’m hoping in the order of weeks.” Walensky said boosters for people who have gotten the Moderna and J&J vaccines will be addressed with similar urgency as Pfizer’s vaccine. She reiterated that the current booster recommendations are only for people who received their second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine more than six months ago. “We haven’t forgotten you if you’ve gotten Moderna and J&J,” Walensky said, when asked how soon boosters for these groups might be seen, and if mixing and matching of vaccines could happen in the near future. “We will with similar urgency address boosters for those populations, as well as looking at the science and data for mix and matching.” Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only approved for children 12 and older, which has stirred concern among health experts as cases in children increase, school years begin and the more transmissible Delta variant spreads. Nearly 26% of all Covid-19 cases nationwide  are reported in children, according to recent data published by the  American Academy of Pediatrics.  And an average of 266 children were hospitalized with Covid-19 every day last week, according to Sunday’s  data from the CDC . Once the data from Pfizer/BioNTech is in, it will have to go through two committees, one for the FDA and one for the CDC, CNN medical analyst Dr. Johnathan Reiner said Sunday. If the data comes in this week, it would likely be in committee by the end of October, he added. And there is a lot of data for them to look at, he said. “This is a vaccine for children, so getting the dose right — in terms of efficacy and side effects — is crucial,” Reiner said. But even when a vaccine becomes available, a difficult task lies ahead in getting children vaccinated. Less than half of US adolescents are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data. In response, officials need to do a better job educating the public about the importance of vaccination for the health of their children and their families as a whole, Reiner said. “If you want kids in school, the best way to keep them in school is to keep them from getting Covid,” he said. Until vaccines are approved for younger children, the CDC has recommended  mask wearing for students, teachers and visitors in schools from kindergarten through grade 12,  along with improved ventilation, physical distancing and testing on a screening basis. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We know how to keep them safe,” Walensky told CBS on Sunday. “When we don’t use the proper mitigation, they’re more likely to have outbreaks.” Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said he encourages parents to vaccinate their children when they can. “This is a dangerous pathogen,” Gottlieb told CNN. “I wouldn’t be so cavalier about this virus, we know that this virus has long-term consequences in a lot of people who contract it, including children.” Current surge likely to die down by Thanksgiving, Gottlieb says Gottlieb predicted the current surge of coronavirus spread is likely to worsen across parts of the country and then die down by Thanksgiving. “I think you’ll see a wave of infection sweep across the Northeast as kids go back to school, the weather turns cold and people move indoors,” Gottlieb told CNN’s Pamela Brown. The virus won’t be gone, Gottlieb said, but hopefully it will reach more manageable levels — which he estimates to be about 20,000 cases per day. According to the CDC, the current seven-day average for new cases in the US is more than 114,000 new cases a day. The decline in cases will likely come from most people attaining immunity to the virus, Gottlieb said. “Some people will get a vaccination; some will challenge their immunity by no choice but getting the infection,” Gottlieb explained. “People who choose to go unvaccinated, they’re going to be vulnerable to getting infected through this Delta wave.” As the US moves into flu season, Gottlieb said, the demand for tests will pick up as people and their doctors try to determine if their flu-like symptoms are due to Covid-19 or influenza. “That’s why it’s so important to get diagnostic tests into the hands of consumers and doctors’ offices as well, things like where people can test in the home will make a difference between telling between Covid and other respiratory infections, especially as the flu picks up,” Gottlieb said. But even if Covid-19 cases do come down by Thanksgiving, health experts are bracing for a difficult winter ahead. It isn’t clear yet what this year’s flu season has in store, but it could add additional stress to an already pressed health care system. “Flu is still a killer, not as much as Covid-19, but between 12,000 and 50,000 Americans lose their lives every year from flu,”  said Dr. Peter Hotez , vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Last year’s flu numbers were low, which health expert say could mean that upcoming seasons may be worse, as there has been little accumulation of immunity. “We’re in for a whopper of a flu season at some point,” Gottlieb said Sunday. Recommending booster for frontline workers a ‘scientific close call,’ CDC director says On Friday, Walensky  recommended  a booster dose for adults at occupational risk of infection — in addition to those with underlying conditions and those over 65 — a decision she said was a “scientific close call.” “And because of that close call, and because of all of the evidence we reviewed at the FDA and the CDC, I thought it was appropriate for those people to be eligible for boosters,” Walensky told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “So who are those people? People who live and work in high-risk settings. That includes people in homeless shelters, people in group homes, people in prisons. But, also, importantly, are people who work with vulnerable communities, so our health care workers, our teachers, our grocery workers, our public transportation employees,” Walensky said. Although the CDC’s vaccine advisers voted against recommending booster doses for people at high risk of infection because of their work or living conditions, Walensky went with the FDA’s authorization including those people. The recommendation is not currently intended for the wider population, but there’s little fear of causing dangerous side effects from adding that third dose, Walensky said. “We have an extraordinary amount of safety data,” she said.

During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 11 to 785. Of those hospitalized, 585 remain in acute care and 200 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 529,736 total confirmed cases and 10,183 deaths. There are 3,884,282 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,890,885 doses. Of those, 3,940,494 are first doses with 3,863 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,583,045 second doses, 3,470 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women.

Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 66,109 additional or booster vaccine doses, 5,485 in the last day. The state reported 83.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state.

He slowed down a bit when diagnosed with COVID-19 last November but described his symptoms as mild. Later, his family became worried when lingering symptoms progressed. “The weights that I was regularly using were entirely too heavy for me,” Stipetich said. His wife and daughters pleaded with him to go back to the doctor. “Make sure everything is OK with your lungs, go get everything checked,” Stipetich said. That was January. Doctors told him he was healthy. But in April, Stipetich came down with a cold and couldn’t sleep. “I would wake up and feel like I was suffocating,” Stipetich said. His family urged him to go to the hospital, believing he may have COVID-19 again. It turned out Stipetich was very sick and in cardiogenic shock. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Throughout all these tests, they came back and said, there is nothing more that they can do for me,” Stipetich said. The news became more terrifying when Stipetich found out his kidneys and liver were failing, and so was his heart. “His heart had given way to a point that he needed to have his life sustained by a mechanical heart pump,” said Dr. Azam Hadi, an advanced heart failure cardiologist at Allegheny Health Network. Dr. Hadi was on Stipetich’s team at AGH. “We were able to turn his shock process around to a point where he recovered his organs except his heart,” the doctor said. Next, Stipetich and his family would learn he needed a transplant. After eight days of his heart being pumped artificially, a donor heart arrived. Dr. Hadi said he has seen a lot of COVID-19 heart issues, including death, but this was a first. Doctors believe the virus remained dormant in Stipetich’s body. “The dormant virus continued to cause inflammation of the heart. And inflammation, in turn, makes the heart weak and get scarred and not able to pump,” Dr. Hadi said. Recovery hasn’t been easy. Stipetich’s strong body took another hit, as his mobility has been impacted. But now several months in, Stipetich is gaining energy. And while extreme sports and lifting may not be in his future, Stipetich and his family have a new purpose.

https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/09/29/government-shutdown-what-happens-debt-ceiling/,,Government Shutdown Latest: What Happens If Federal Agencies Close?,CBS Baltimore,CBS Baltimore,The federal government may be headed toward another shutdown. How could that affect you?,"( CBS Detroit ) —  The federal government looks to be heading toward another shutdown. The government’s fiscal year ends Thursday, September 30, but lawmakers have yet to fund the government or suspend the debt ceiling. If nothing happens before Friday, most federal employees will stop going to work and many Americans could start to see a loss of certain services. How Does It Come To This? The government spends more money than it receives in tax revenue. That annual budget deficit is paid for by borrowing additional money. But there is a limit to how much the country can borrow to pay its existing obligations. It’s called the debt ceiling. That ceiling is increased or suspended whenever spending approaches its limit, allowing the government to borrow more money and stay open. But without an agreement in Congress, the Treasury Department can’t keep paying the federal government’s bills. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The  debt ceiling  was established over a century ago as a way to prevent federal agencies from ignoring Congress’s right to control spending. For decades increasing it was a relatively routine event without much fanfare. But the decision has grown increasingly politicized in recent years. On Monday,  Senate Republicans  blocked a bill that would have suspended the debt ceiling through December 22 and funded the government through December 3, avoiding a shutdown. The votes fell along party lines, leaving it 10 short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Reconciliation, which would only require 50 votes plus the Vice President’s tiebreaker, is the likely next step. Should the government fail to raise the debt ceiling, it would soon run the risk of  defaulting on its loans . Any default would be the first in the country’s history and send tremors across financial markets across the country and the world. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress on Tuesday that the federal government would cease to be able to pay its bills on October 18 or thereabouts. What Services Could See Changes? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn If Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit by midnight Thursday, a full government shutdown would begin Friday morning. Only  essential federal employees  will report to work that day and every day forward until the limit is raised. Non-essential employees would stop working. The federal government employs about 2.1 million people, not including the Postal Service. And every agency has its own shutdown procedures, so the definition of “essential” varies. In early 2018, when the government experienced a partial shutdown, about 850,000 workers stayed home. The potential scope of a shutdown this year could easily meet or exceed that number. With every agency executing its own shutdown plan, it’s unclear what services will be affected. Drawing from previous experience, it seems possible that national parks will be closed to visitors. Parks were closed during the 2013 shutdown, but some remained open during the 2018-19 shutdown. The National Science Foundation, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Institute of Standards and Technology all suspended work three years ago. Other government work will almost certainly also be delayed The Internal Revenue Service could stop verifying income and Social Security numbers, leading to delays for personal loans. The  Federal Housing Administration  and Small Business Administration may not be able to process new loan applications either. Parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health could  cease operations , which seems less than ideal during an ongoing pandemic. It’s unclear how a shutdown would affect clinical trials of the COVID vaccine for children ages 5-12. What About Essential Services? MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Employees deemed essential must continue to report to work without pay. Based on past shutdowns, plenty of services that millions rely on should continue in the short-term. That includes border protection, air traffic control, law enforcement, and power grid maintenance.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Earlier this year, the NBA announced the creation of the  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion award , “a new annual honor that will recognize a current NBA player for pursuing social justice and upholding the league’s decades-long values of equality, respect and inclusion.” Abdul-Jabbar insists that it’s part of a player’s responsibility as a public figure to avoid spreading false narratives and to be aware of the significant social impact they have on their communities.   (Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Turner Sports)   “They are failing to live up to the responsibilities that come with celebrity. Athletes are under no obligation to be spokespersons for the government, but this is a matter of public health,” said Abdul-Jabar in an email to  Rolling Stone . “By not encouraging their people to get the vaccine, they’re contributing to these deaths. I’m also concerned about how this perpetuates the stereotype of dumb jocks who are unable to look at verified scientific evidence and reach a rational conclusion.” These comments come with NBA media day’s taking place across the country and the upcoming season quickly approaching. The league continues to incentive getting the vaccine by requiring unvaccinated players to submit to regular testing – once on practice or travel days and at least once on game days,  according to the Associated Press . Fully vaccinated players will not be required to submit to regular testing. However, that hasn’t stopped some of the NBA’s most high-profile superstars from refusing to publicly acknowledge their vaccination status. Despite multiple media outlets reporting that nearly 90 percent of NBA players are fully vaccinated, there have been  multiple players  who have publicly spoken against the vaccine sparking controversy in locker rooms across the association. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Kyrie Irving, who was not present for Brooklyn Nets media day due to health and safety protocols, has been one of the most vocal players about being unvaccinated.   (Photo by Steven Ryan/Getty Images)   “Living in this public sphere, there’s a lot of questions about what’s going on in the world of Kyrie,” he said, “and I would love to just keep that private and handle that the right way with my team and go forward with a plan.” The Nets, who are one of the heavy favorites to compete in this year’s NBA Finals, will have to overcome some obstacles as Brooklyn, and the Golden State Warriors, are located in cities that require athletes to have at least one dose of Covid vaccination. Therefore, if Irving were to remain unvaccinated, he would be ineligible to play at home games at the Barclays Center. Washington Wizards superstar Bradley Beal, who missed the Olympics with USA Basketball after being placed in health and safety protocols, has joined Irving in publicly criticizing the emphasis being put on vaccination status. “What happens if one of our players gets the vaccine and can’t play after that? Or they have complications after that? Because there are cases like that,” said Beal regarding breakthrough cases among those that are fully-vaccinated. Abdul-Jabbar expressed his frustration with players who are refusing the vaccine and fail to do “the necessary research.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “What I find especially disingenuous about the vaccine deniers is their arrogance at disbelieving immunology and other medial experts,” he said. “Yet, if their child was sick or they themselves needed emergency medical treatment, how quickly would they do exactly what those same experts told them to do?”",0.011330470604664153,0.3831998646514776,684,2021-10-12T06:32:11+00:00,2021-09-29T15:15:30+00:00,2021-09-29T15:15:30+00:00

Martinez homered and drove in three runs to back a dominant pitching performance by Nathan Eovaldi, and the Boston Red Sox broke a four-game skid and bolstered their playoff hopes by beating the Baltimore Orioles 6-0 Wednesday night. Hunter Renfroe also went deep for the Red Sox, who failed to score three runs in any game during their losing streak. Although Boston didn’t completely recover its offensive mojo, the 13-hit attack was more than enough to get past the last-place Orioles. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The Red Sox entered trailing the Yankees by two games for the top AL wild card and holding a half-game edge over Seattle for the second slot. Toronto was also in the mix, one game behind Boston. Martinez hit his 28th homer in the second inning for a 1-0 lead, and the Red Sox used a broken-bat single and an error to tack on two unearned runs in the sixth. Eovaldi (11-9) took it from there, limiting Baltimore to four hits and striking out seven over six innings. The right-hander was 0-2 in his previous eight starts, including a loss Friday night in which he yielded seven runs to the Yankees. Boston had seven hits after five innings with only one run to show for it against rookie Zac Lowther, who yielded 10 runs and 12 hits over his previous two starts against the Red Sox. Lowther (1-3) was pulled after Rafael Devers cracked his bat on a leadoff single in the sixth. Xander Bogaerts subsequently reached on an error by third baseman Kelvin Gutiérrez before Martinez smacked a two-run double. Alex Verdugo added a two-run single in the eighth, and Renfroe hit his 30th homer in the ninth.

Mullins is the first player in Orioles history to have 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases in a single season, and he was Baltimore’s lone representative at the All-Star Game. He leads the team in games played, batting average, doubles, triples, stolen bases and runs. TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: RHP Garrett Whitlock (pectoral strain) played catch before the game. “He feels great,” manager Alex Cora said. “The goal is for him to throw a bullpen Friday and go from there.” … LHP Josh Taylor (lower back strain) remains in Boston and has not yet participated in baseball activities. … RHP Phillips Valdez and INF/OF Danny Santana have been on the COVID-19 list for several weeks, but are working out and have the potential to return. “Anything can happen in two hours or in the upcoming days. You’ve got to get them ready,” Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox: Nick Pivetta (9-7, 4.52 ERA) starts the series finale Thursday night. The right-hander is winless in six starts since beating Baltimore on Aug. 13. Orioles: Rookie LHP Alexander Wells (1-3, 7.61) makes his eighth career start, the second against Boston.

We are an ‘import’ state in Maryland, which means we get a lot of our teachers from outside our universities and colleges.” She noted as covid cases spread, some virtual classes in Baltimore County have 50 students. She also said the pandemic is changing the workload. “We’re adjusting to having students in our classrooms—trying to take care of all the health and safety needs, the trauma that has taken place with student evictions. We have increased homelessness. And we have a shortage of counselors and school  psychologists and social workers. All of those jobs are being placed on teachers in our classrooms.” Maryland is also seeing a severe bus driver shortage, a lack of substitutes, and school nurses and administrators are taking on the added duties of contact tracing positive covid cases as outbreaks spread.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW-  Hello Drew! Nice to see you today and congrats on the big special tonight celebrating 50 years of  The Price Is Right.  Right off the bat what does that number mean to you being a part of a show that’s been on for half a century? DC-  You know, there’s not many TV shows that make it that far and I really have to credit just the structure of the show. I can’t take any credit for this at all, really, except for like carrying the torch and being a good steward, I guess. The better stewards are all the people in the production office that have been there longer than me and have a really invested stake in the show. People really do care a lot about this show that work on it and it really shows in the final product. It’s just really interesting and a great place for me to be when everybody cares so much about putting a good product out and making people happy. They know what a history the show has and they’re taking extra care of it. I don’t know it’s like working at the Washington Monument or something, taking care of this old thing that people treasure. [Laughs] MW-  Well, you’ve been the head caretaker of the Washington Monument for 14 years with that analogy. What are you most proud of from your tenure? DC-  I don’t know, I don’t really think like that. I’m just glad the show still doing well, you know? I know what a team effort it is because I see it behind the scenes. I’m here watching the people behind the camera run in and out when the contestants are coming down setting up the prizes. You know the grips and the crew are pushing cars and racing to plug things in. I don’t know I can’t take pride, I just feel fortunate to work with a crew like that and to work with people like that. I feel a lot of gratitude and I do feel really fortunate and blessed to be in this position. MW-  Good point you never think about how the cars get there… DC-  Oh yea and they’re not allowed to start them on stage because we’re in an enclosed building and we don’t want people to faint, you know, carbon monoxide poisoning. I mean they unhook the batteries  and there’s like a team that pushes the cars around the stage, down a ramp, then outside. It’s really like a big production backstage, it’s crazy, READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn MW-  Especially important now that there are fans in the building again! How much different is it now with people in the crowd? DC-  It was a little weird when we didn’t have any audience at all, but the people that did show up were very enthusiastic and great, so that made it good. It’s much better now though and it’s not a full 300- plus size audience like we had before COVID, but it’s way better and it looks really good. The production team did such a good job putting everything together and making it look good, which was another big accomplishment by them. Things were changing day-to-day you know and whether we’re gonna have a full audience or not we were going to have the show. So yeah, feels a lot better now with people I can talk to and it’s a lot more noise. It was a little more mellow without an audience, like I was just talking to somebody in my living room and now it’s an audience again, so that feels a better. MW-  Glad we’ll have an audience tonight to supply that energy tonight for the 50 year special. What are you most excited for tonight? DC-  There’s a lot of great clips in the show. The rest of the show is a regular show and we’re giving away really good prizes, we have a couple new games that are that are fun. We have a couple of really great celebrity guests that I’m excited about. One of those guests is a secret I’m not allowed to say but it’s a really famous person. There’s so many good clips and moments from the show. The main part of the show is watching all this history. It’s really great to watch just as a TV fan. They showed the clips live in the studio and I was just there with my jaw hitting the floor watching. It’s going to be really fun. MW-   The Price Is Right  is such a big part of TV history and something everyone feels connected to so I’m very excited for the special tonight and congrats to you for your 14 years at the helm keeping that old monument good and shiny. Thanks for the time Drew and all the best moving forward! DC-  Thanks buddy, take care!

(WJZ)  — The Anne Arundel County Health Department on Thursday said it is recommending fully vaccinated students and school staff who are asymptomatic will not have to quarantine after a close contact, in accordance with new CDC guidelines. Under the suggested protocols, fully vaccinated close contacts should get tested three to five days after being exposed to COVID-19, the agency said. But students and staff without symptoms can continue to attend school in-person and participate in other activities.

The school system started with quarantine protocols requiring that students and staff stay at home for 14 days after a possible exposure, but the guideline was eventually reduced to 10 days, said Mosier. Under the new recommendations from the health department, students and staff would only have to quarantine for a week if they test negative five to seven days after a possible exposure. Kalyanaraman urged parents of students age 12 or older to have their children get vaccinated if they want to stay in the classroom and participate in sports.

Survivor  is pulling no punches in season 41 as we already have our third elimination and this time it was neurosurgeon David Voce who had to watch Jeff Probst snuff out his flame. CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke with Voce to discuss trying to sleep without clocks, competing on the island and what lead to his blindside elimination. READ MORE:  ‘Survivor 41’: Episode 2 Recap: Introducing A New Advantage! MW-  Hello David! Sorry we’re talking a lot earlier than you had probably hope but you’re still part of a very small group of group who even get to the island so I hope you’re still proud of that. What was your reaction to setting foot on that island and living out a dream? DV-  So for me and several other people we were cast before COVID And then that all fell through and so to finally be out there, there was just this overwhelming excitement. Especially after COVID and quarantining and finally being free to be around people. You can feel just the the vibe, even from the crew, everyone was just so excited to be out there. I lived a dream, even thought five days was way too short, it’s crazy how much of those five days are permanently seared into my memory now. It was just such an incredible experience and coming back and trying to describe it to people is hard. It’s literally like a drug where you get this high of being out there and then it’s taken away. I feel like I need the next hit, it’s just an incredible adventure, a once-in-a-lifetime adventure and I’m really grateful for it. MW-  That’s a very unique thing like you said, being on the show during COVID. Obviously it’s far from everyday life but was there any sense of normalcy that at the very least you could be around people again? DV-   Survivor  is not normal at all. [Laughs] Before going out there a lot of people would say Jeff has that line of it’s going to rock you to your core and people talk about mental health and it’s all true. We were on an island, it’s 24/7 non-stop living with people from all different walks of life, all different backgrounds, and being able to kind of create a society together. Those taglines that we hear over and over again, that really is what it is. You know you don’t have the cell phones, computers, the work schedules everything that all goes out the window. It’s this weird society that’s happening, you go out there and it’s just this incredible microcosm that happens. It’s kind of mind boggling how quickly you fall into this small society that you’re creating. It really just kind of teaches you what’s important in life, and kind of resets your mind, how to kind of approach life. MW-  Even things like not knowing what time it is, I imagine that has to really throw you for a loop? DV-  The hardest part is waking up in the middle of the night. You feel pretty rested so you think it must be close to morning and then like 10 hours go by and it’s still dark out. You realize ok maybe it was only like 7pm. [Laughs] MW-  You also got to experience a few challenges, so walk me through what that’s like when you step up to that starting line? DV-  Yeah, I mean it’s adrenaline rush. You just have complete adrenaline pushing you through those challenges. It’s hard to describe how intense those challenges are. Everything is so heavy, everything is so intense. You know that sweat challenge was way underrated, we almost didn’t finish, that was one of the hardest things I’ve done in my life. Our thighs were bloody from the chafing, we had scars all over the place. We were just completely wiped out. READ MORE:  Eric Abraham Proud To Represent His Family On Survivor Despite Early Exit: ‘It Was A Great Experience, I Just Didn’t See It Coming’ So what you see on TV, just know it’s way harder. You think ‘oh I can do that, that’d be fun’ and then you get out there and it’s a totally different ballgame. You do have time to strategize, but it’s not a lot. So in that last challenge, the water challenge, you saw me in my underwear because I was supposed to actually swim and then last minute Tiffany said she could do the beam and they wanted me on a puzzle because I could do puzzles. So everything just kind of is happening the way it happens because everything’s moving so fast. It’s incredible the out there but it’s also like, I’ve got to perform. MW-  And also like you said you’re doing it on not the best night’s sleep and very little food, so you’re mind isn’t really where it needs to be either I assume. DV-  Exactly, yeah. The best example of it is Tiffany last night, love her to death but what in the world happened? I mean she just lost all touch with reality. What you saw was Liana be like this is idiotic, and Evie being like what is happening? Evie told Deshawn that Xander is going home, he has these idols and that’s why she told him everything. What you didn’t really see is when Evie got back from that trek she only had about five minutes with us, and that’s why she was like wait what, why does Tiffany, want to do this? But there was no time and I think if there had been even a little more time Evie would have said, then let’s split the vote. Let’s do a two-one vote so that we can still get out Xander and if he plays something then Voce will go. So it just did not make sense, and you see that and Tiffany saying I don’t have any food I’m not thinking straight and just the paranoia and complete lack of any sense that set in. MW-  So when you are staring down that moment and you realize you might be going home, what was that moment like for you? DV-  Honestly, that was such a blindside. I knew as soon as the first vote was read and it was my vote for Tiffany I was like uh-oh. You never want to see your vote first. That’s kind of when I realized that and honestly, it was just devastation. After you get voted out it’s kind of a whirlwind and you’re sitting there getting your final thoughts and this was a total blindside. I said at the time I guess it was my relationship maintenance but I actually take that back a little. At that point I just felt like I was close to people, I thought I had real bonds with people, and I did have those bonds with people. It’s just that when stuff hit the fan, I didn’t actually realize that stuff was hitting the fan. I don’t think that that was a lack of self awareness, I think it was just a pure moment of Russian roulette mayhem. There were so many advantages, there were so many twists, it was just like this huge cluster. It was just a matter of where does the bullet go and it went for me, which sucks but that’s  Survivor  and that’s life MW-  Well hopefully we see you back out there sometime, like I said you still made it to the island which is a huge accomplishment in its own right. You handled yourself well out there and it was great catching up with you today! DV-  Thanks Matt, take care!

Baltimore has lost 107 games this year but took two of three in this series against Boston — welcome news for the Yankees, Blue Jays and Mariners. The Red Sox fell into a tie with Seattle for the American League’s second wild card. Boston trailed the Yankees by 1 1/2 games and led the Blue Jays by half a game, pending the conclusion of New York’s game at Toronto. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Kiké Hernandez homered on the first pitch of the game for the Red Sox, but not much went right for them after that. Mountcastle put Baltimore up 3-1 with his 33rd home run of the season, and the Orioles added three more runs in the sixth. Boston’s Nick Pivetta (9-8) struck out the side in the first, but he ultimately allowed three runs and four hits in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out eight with two walks. Alexander Wells (2-3) allowed a run and three hits in six innings after entering the game with a 7.61 ERA. This wasn’t as bad as 2011, when the Red Sox allowed two runs in the ninth inning at Baltimore and were eliminated on the final night of the regular season. That collapse ended manager Terry Francona’s tenure in Boston. A decade later, the Orioles were a thorn in Boston’s side again, but the Red Sox still have time to recover when they finish the regular season with a series at Washington. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Boston pitchers threw four wild pitches in this game. Two of them came in the sixth, when the Red Sox also made an error. Tyler Nevin gave the Orioles a 5-1 lead with a two-run single, and Pat Valaika followed with a sacrifice fly. TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: Boston is in an odd spot at second base. Christian Arroyo was reinstated from the COVID-19 injured list over a week ago, but José Iglesias has hit .339 in 20 games for Boston and continues to play. The Red Sox signed Iglesias in early September, so he can’t play for them in the postseason if they make it. Manager Alex Cora said Arroyo, who has played only twice since his return, is doing what he can to stay sharp. “Hopefully we have to make that decision, let’s put it that way, right? Who’s going to play second in the playoffs?” Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox: Eduardo Rodriguez (11-8) starts Friday night in the opener of the series at Washington.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The annual “Harbor Heartbeat” reported that levels of harmful bacteria are declining in the water, with 92 percent of testing sites (with enough data) showing improving or consistently high scoring bacteria scores. The report noted that testing was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lindquist said consistently improving bacteria scores was enough for the partnership to start plans for a new network of water-based trails. “We’re actually announcing today the release of a request for proposals to create a master plan for the Baltimore Blue Way, a network of water trails for paddlers in the Baltimore Harbor,” he said. The non-profit stated in its proposal that the vision for the water trail system is to follow the shoreline of the harbor and could extend from Canton Waterfront Park to the Inner Harbor and out to Masonville Cove. “I think now since the water is getting cleaner and cleaner, the idea of different activities on the water for different groups of people that are more accessible is starting to become a real possibility,” said Valerie Bloom, a former intern for Waterfront Partnership who was paddling in the harbor after the announcement about the water trails. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The report also noted that Baltimore City’s Headworks Project, which was completed last year, corrected a major flaw in its sewer system which caused tens of millions of gallons of sewage to overflow into streams and the harbor. The project included installing tanks at a city wastewater treatment plant to store water that would overflow during storms. The study stated that continued monitoring is needed to show if the project is having the desired effect on the health of Baltimore’s marine ecosystem. Another finding showed that the city’s four trash wheels have “ate” 1,608 tons of trash since the first one was installed in 2014 through 2020. Waterfront Partnership also noted in the report that while water quality in the harbor frequently tests safe for swimming, it does not recommend swimming in it at this time. “A swimming area must be monitored to protect swimmers from boat traffic, debris, toxic algal blooms, or legacy contaminants in the sediment. For these reasons, we do not recommend swimming outside of a designated swimming area. Waterfront Partnership has begun working on creating the first such swimming area in Baltimore City,” the report stated.

Larry Hogan said on Thursday. But the governor also criticized some Maryland school districts for not taking advantage of a state testing program and federal stimulus money to enhance safety in the classroom. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured On Tuesday, Maryland’s Board of Education  reported there have been 4,042 confirmed cases  among students in schools statewide and 681 cases among staff members. Since schools reopened, at least 16,559 students have had to quarantine, along with 784 staff members since schools reopened. “The most important thing that school systems can do right now to limit outbreaks and to prevent needless quarantines is to utilize the robust testing capacity that they’ve been given,” Hogan said during a press conference. In 2020, the state provided one million COVID-19 tests to public and non-public schools. This year, the state has earmarked $182 million for an optional program to regularly test the student population, but only 13 of the state’s 24 school systems have enrolled, Hogan said. Districts in Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Caroline, Charles, Dorchester, Frederick, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince  George’s and Worcester counties and Baltimore City, as well as 80 non-public schools, have all enrolled. The deadline to join has been extended until Oct. 10, Hogan said.

The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .05% to 4.09%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 21 to 776. Of those hospitalized, 588 remain in acute care and 209 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 533,870 total confirmed cases and 10,229 deaths. There are 3,895,792 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,928,109 doses. Of those, 3,950,385 are first doses with 2,413 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,592,515 second doses, 2,521 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 303,277 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 782 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 81,932 additional or booster vaccine doses, 3,791 in the last day. The state reported 83.7% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state.

Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 24 to 752. Of those hospitalized, 548 remain in acute care and 204 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 535,157 total confirmed cases and 10,243 deaths. There are 3,903,142 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,954,222 doses. Of those, 3,957,284 are first doses with 6,899 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,599,123 second doses, 6,608 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 304,019 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 742 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 92,796 additional or booster vaccine doses, 11,864 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 83.8% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Pharmaceutical company Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said they’ve developed a drug that reduces the risk of hospitalization or death for patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured If cleared by federal regulators, it would be the first pill to treat COVID-19. Doctors said this COVID-19 pill will hopefully allow them to treat many more COVID patients at home faster, and ease the load on hospitals. But they also want to remind people this new breakthrough should not minimize the push to get vaccinated. “This is exciting and can be a really important part of our toolbox,” Dr. Namandje N. Bumpus, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said. Pharmaceutical company Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics recently announced promising results with its experimental COVID-19 anti-viral drug, Molnupiravir. “It essentially works by preventing replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” Bumpus said. The drug company looked at 775 adults with mild to moderate COVID-19, at high risk for severe disease. The patients who received the antiviral pill took it within five days of symptoms. “They needed to stop the study and go forward and present the data, because it was so positive and so clear-cut, it seems,” Bumpus said. Their study shows the pill has cut the risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 in at-risk patients by 50%. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I think when we’re seeing these things come out, there’s a little bit of thinking now,  Well I don’t need to get vaccinated now, if there’s a treatment ,” Bumpus said. Still, doctors continue to stress vaccines remain the number one tool in the fight against COVID-19. “We’re trying to prevent getting COVID in the first place,” Bumpus said. This comes as Maryland reported over 1,000 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths Sunday. The statewide positivity rate is slightly up, at 4.1 percent. “There’s people getting their first dose today,” said Dr. Kathleen Page, infectious disease physician and faculty at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “So that’s fantastic.” In Baltimore, COVID-19 ambassadors with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine have been hard at work targeting the Latino community. “I think it’s important to be where the community is, to meet people where they are,” Page said. So far, over 107,000 Marylanders have received booster shots, and there’s been a sharp rise in the daily first and second doses administered over the past two days. Merck officials said the company plans to seek emergency authorization from the FDA as soon as possible for its COVID-19 treatment pill.

But It’s Still Too Early To Let Our Guard Down",CBS Baltimore Staff,CBS Baltimore,"With winter fast approaching, experts have warned of the double threat Covid-19 and the flu could have on an already strained health care system.","(CNN) —  The US is “turning the corner” on its current  Covid-19  surge but vaccination remains key to ensuring cases continue trending downward ahead of the holiday season, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday. The US is averaging around 107,000 new infections every day, according to Johns Hopkins University — down from more than 150,000 just last month. Rates of hospitalizations and deaths have also been on the decline. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured But Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC’s “This Week” that over nearly 20 months of the pandemic, Covid surges have subsided only to come back again. “The way to keep it down, to make that turnaround continue to go down, is to … get people vaccinated. When you have 70 million people in the country who are eligible to be vaccinated who are not yet vaccinated, that’s the danger zone right there,” Fauci said. With winter fast approaching, experts have warned of the  double threat  Covid-19 and the flu could have on an already strained health care system. But Fauci told CBS’s “Face the Nation” it is too early to tell whether the holiday season will be a safe time for Americans to gather. “We’ve just got to concentrate on continuing to get those numbers down, and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we’re going to do at a particular time,” he said. “Let’s focus like a laser on continuing to get those cases down, and we can do it by people getting vaccinated.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its  guidance on holiday celebrations , urging people to get vaccinated before the holidays and wear a mask indoors in public in areas of substantial transmission. “Attending gatherings to celebrate events and holidays increases your risk of getting and spreading Covid-19. The safest way to celebrate is virtually, with people who live with you, or outside and at least 6 feet apart from others,” it said. The CDC guidance also recommends people delay travel until they are fully vaccinated. Nearly 56% of the total US population, or 65.4% of those ages 12 and up who are eligible, are fully vaccinated, according to data  published Sunday by the CDC. However, 15 states have yet to fully vaccinate more than half of their residents, according to CDC data: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming. Mandates spur vaccination and opposition Mandates requiring employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19  have spurred some workers to get vaccinated in recent weeks, but others who have declined vaccination are being suspended or losing their jobs. In New York City, a vaccine mandate for educators went into effect Friday afternoon, and New York City Schools Chancellor Meisha Porter told CNN she did not expect the mandate to result in a teacher shortage Monday, noting 93% of the city’s teachers are vaccinated. “We have more subs that are vaccinated than unvaccinated, teachers and our superintendents have been working with our principals to develop plans to ensure our students get the education and continue to get the education they deserve in person,” Porter said. Porter pushed back on claims from some teachers who say they are being unfairly forced to vaccinate instead of being given a chance to test out. “We are responsible for over a million students and we have elementary school students who are not eligible for vaccination and so we have to do everything in our power to wrap a bubble of protection around our children and keep them safe,” Porter said. On CBS Sunday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, warned against the politicization of vaccines in the US. Gottlieb said vaccination has always been viewed as a collective decision rather than just individual choice. “That’s why we have a childhood immunization schedule, because your behavior — with respect to your choice around vaccination — affects your community,” he said. Gottlieb said there could be consequences of vaccination becoming a political issue. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I worry that, going forward, we’re going to see vaccination rates decline as this becomes more of a political football, and we see people — literally, governors running against vaccines and vaccine mandates — in the next presidential cycle. That’s going to the be deleterious to the public health, generally, if that’s what comes out of this episode we’re in,” he said. Promising pill shouldn’t deter vaccination The US  surpassed 700,000 deaths  from Covid-19 Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University and the country is still averaging nearly 1,900 deaths a day. President Joe Biden marked the grim toll in a statement Saturday, and noted the impact of vaccination, saying, “Hundreds of thousands of families have been spared the unbearable loss that too many Americans have already endured during this pandemic.” As the country reflected on the death toll, Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics  announced  they had created an antiviral pill that can reduce Covid-19 hospitalization and death by 50%, according to their data. Merck said it would seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its molnupiravir medication “as soon as possible.” If permitted, it would become the first oral medicine that fights Covid-19. The news was hailed by health experts who also cautioned it shouldn’t be a replacement for vaccinations. “It is never OK to get infected,” Fauci told CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday. “It decreased the risk — this pill did — of hospitalizations and death by 50%. You know the way to decrease the risk by 100%? Don’t get infected in the first place,” he said. As for those relying on previous infection to protect them from getting Covid-19 again, a new study published Friday in the journal The Lancet Microbe, suggests that protection may be short-lived. “Reinfection can reasonably happen in three months or less,” Jeffrey Townsend, a professor of biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health and the study’s lead author, said in a news release. “Therefore, those who have been naturally infected should get vaccinated. Previous infection alone can offer very little long-term protection against subsequent infections.” Vaccines for children on the horizon Parents hoping to vaccinate their children received some good news last week, with Pfizer announcing Tuesday it had submitted Covid-19 vaccine data on children ages 5 to 11 to the FDA for initial review. The company has not yet sought emergency use authorization, but on Friday, the FDA announced its vaccine advisers would meet on October 26 to discuss the data. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is currently approved for people age 16 and older in the US, and has emergency use authorization for people ages 12 to 15. On Sunday, Fauci warned while a child might have less chance of having a severe outcome from a case of Covid-19, it is not a “benign situation.” “We are seeing now, very clearly, if you go to pediatric hospitals, that although this risk is less than the adult, there are children in hospital who are getting seriously ill,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” There is also the risk of long Covid, where some survivors, including children, suffer lingering symptoms for months after getting infected, he said. “You want to protect your child, but you also want to make the child a part of the solution, mainly so that there’s not spread of infection, either within your household or to other vulnerable people,” Fauci said, adding it is a “very positive, good thing to get their children vaccinated.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .02% to 4.08%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by one to 763. Of those hospitalized, 564 remain in acute care and 199 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 537,327 total confirmed cases and 10,260 deaths. There are 3,910,022 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,981,466 doses. Of those, 3,964,287 are first doses with 7,003 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,605,753 second doses, 6,630 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 304,269 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 250 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 107,156 additional or booster vaccine doses, 13,360 in the last day. The state reported 84% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Scott tested positive for covid-19 Monday after taking two tests. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “The severity of this pandemic has not diminished,” said Scott on Friday. The mayor is fully vaccinated. He received his first dose in March. “The vaccine essentially prepped the mayor’s immune system to fight the virus,” said Dr. Esti Schabelman, Chief Medical Officer, Sinai Hospital. The mayor’s staff told WJZ, he’s now working from his Northeast Baltimore home until he can be medically cleared to come back to City Hall. “He’s gonna have to isolate just like anyone else who gets COVID so that you don’t get anyone else sick,” said Dr. Schabelman. Mayor Scott is routinely tested and on Friday his results were negative. Over the weekend he attended multiple public events including the Parade of Latino Nations in East Baltimore on Sunday. “I spent part of my weekend with Mayor Scott,” said Zeke Cohen, Baltimore City Councilman, District 1. “I felt it was important to get tested and of course follow all CDC COVID protocols.” Councilman Cohen says his test came back negative Monday but he plans to test again in a few days. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “This is why it is so important to get vaccinated,” Cohen added. Dr. Schabelman of Sinai Hospital says these breakthrough cases will keep happening as long as some people remain unvaccinated. “The rate of breakthrough cases depends on how highly vaccinated that state is. In Maryland, we have about a .12 percent breakthrough rate,” Schabelban said. On Friday, Mayor Scott continued to push people to get the shot. “We are dying more than anywhere else. That’s the reality that’s happening in our city,” Scott said. The mayor’s staff is being tested and they’re working with the city’s contact tracing team to find anyone else who may have been exposed.

They’re also worried about COVID-19 precautions and safety precautions in general. “A lot of attendants get physically hurt and injured by kids and we don’t have a policy for that,” bus attendant Taaliyah Price said. “So, we’re just supposed to take it and endure it until we drop the kids off and pick them up.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Annapolis Bus Company is one of about 15 bus companies that have contracts with Anne Arundel County Schools.

From cereal to soap, paper towels to pretzels, you might have noticed you’re not getting as much as you used to at the grocery store. Consumer blogs pointed WCCO to products like oatmeal packets of 10 cut to eight for some varieties, tuna cans from seven to five ounces, and some family size cereals slimming down from 19.3 ounces to 18.8 ounces, all evidence of inflation, or what’s known as shrinkflation. Kim Sovell, a marketing professor at the University of St. Thomas, says companies have learned how consumers don’t like to pay more. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “It’s really a way to conceal higher prices,” Sovell said. “We’re very deterred by price increases. We’ll switch brands. … We focus on cost over quantity. Cost over quality.” Unless you have an old box in your cabinet at home to compare, you might not notice. “We check prices every time we shop but we rarely check weight,” Sovell said. The world economy continues to struggle with pandemic woes, and if you haven’t noticed price hikes, Sovell expects it to be more pronounced soon. The maker of Huggies diapers and Cottonelle toilet paper announced it will charge 4% to 9% more through 2022. Proctor and Gamble, behind products like Gillette Razors and Tide detergent, is also looking at price spikes. “Any time we start slowing down manufacturing and shipping while in the U.S. demand for products is high, what we’re going to see is supply not being able to meet demand, which is a sure-fire way to have increased prices,” Sovell said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Sovell traces Shrinkflation back to the ’70s. Judging by the history books, she says the changes usually stick. For instance, orange juice used to come in half gallon or 64 ounce-containers. Also, Dial soap adapted its trademark concave shape. It’s all a way to give us less and in some cases, even charge us more. Breyers ice cream is another good example — 64 ounces have gone to 48. The price didn’t stay the same, either; it went up by 25%. “Being mindful and watchful of our usage is about the only thing we can do as consumers,” Sovell said. Sovell also believes tracking prices and sizes is key, spotting a practice that shouldn’t be a secret. “We’ll come to realize that maybe it isn’t necessarily devious or sneaky but necessary, necessary for business, necessary to keep providing us the products that we want to be able to use,” she said. Sovell also says shopping the sales, using coupons and rebates can also help. Buying in bulk can also sometimes work in your favor, but Sovell says it’s something you should also be weight conscious if implementing.

Every time we do and we put our guard down … we get another surge with another variant,” said Dr. Jorge Rodriguez, a viral researcher and internal medicine physician. “So yes, things are better. But they’re far from over.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured On average, 107,312 new cases were reported each day over the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, the lowest since August 5. Hospitalizations have dropped, too. About 71,325 patients are hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, a 12.7% decrease compared to last week. “It does not signal the beginning of the end of this pandemic,” Rodriguez said Monday. “What it signals is that we are now on the downswing here of this latest surge, this Delta surge. But we’re still getting over 100,000 infections a day. And right now, the tide is higher than it was a year ago.” The daily Covid-19 death toll is a sobering reality check. Over the past week, an average of more than 1,800 Americans died from Covid-19 every day, according to Johns Hopkins. Health experts say  the vast majority of those deaths were preventable  with vaccination. ‘Let’s focus like a laser’ Whether Americans can gather more safely this holiday season largely depends upon actions taken now, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. “The best way to assure that we’ll be in good shape as we get into the winter would be to get more and more people vaccinated,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN Monday. Multiple times throughout the pandemic, Covid-19 numbers have dropped, only to surge again, sometimes with a new variant. “We’ve just got to concentrate on continuing to get those numbers down, and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we’re going to do at a particular time,” Fauci told CBS Sunday. “Let’s focus like a laser on continuing to get those cases down, and we can do it by people getting vaccinated.” As of Sunday, 55.9% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. Vaccines for younger kids might be within weeks The US Food and Drug Administration said Friday its vaccine advisers will meet October 26 to discuss data from Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine trial among children 5 to 11. That does not necessarily mean children in that age group can start getting shots right afterward. The FDA vaccine advisers would have to first make a recommendation, and the FDA would vote on it. Then, the CDC would have to sign off before children ages 5 to 11 could start getting vaccinated. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Some health experts say kids in that age group might be able to get their first shots by the end of October or November. But just like with adults, those children would need two doses. While children who get Covid-19 often have less severe cases than adults, kids can still be  vulnerable to serious illness and long-term effects , Fauci told CNN. He said those are important reasons to vaccinate children. “Look at the pediatric hospitals throughout the country, and you can ask any pediatric hospitalist, they’re seeing a lot of children in the hospital with severe infection,” Fauci told CNN on Monday. “So, although relatively speaking for the rest of the epidemic, it’s a lesser proportion, the fact is, it still can have a serious impact on children, not to mention the issue of long Covid,” Fauci said. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported Monday that new infections among children remains “exceptionally high,” now making up almost 27% of all new cases reported nationwide. Don’t rely on a past infection or an unauthorized pill Friday, the pharmaceutical company Merck said molnupiravir, an investigational antiviral drug made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics,  can reduce the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19 by half . But  full data from the molnupiravir trial had not yet been released or peer-reviewed . And it’s not clear if or when the pill might be authorized by the FDA to fight Covid-19. “It’s not an alternative to vaccination,” former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said. “We still have to try to get more people vaccinated.” Vaccination is still the best way to reduce the risk of infection, hospitalization and death from Covid-19, Fauci said. “The news of the efficacy of this particular antiviral (molnupiravir) is obviously very good news,” he said. “It decreased the risk — this pill did — of hospitalizations and deaths by 50%. You know the way to decrease the risk by 100%? Don’t get infected in the first place.” As for those assuming previous infection will keep them immune from Covid-19, a study published Friday in the journal The Lancet Microbe suggests protection may be short-lived. “Reinfection can reasonably happen in three months or less,” lead author Jeffrey Townsend, a professor of biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health, said in a news release. “Therefore, those who have been naturally infected should get vaccinated. Previous infection alone can offer very little long-term protection against subsequent infections,” he said.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .17% to 3.91%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 11 to 774. Of those hospitalized, 573 remain in acute care and 201 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 537,976 total confirmed cases and 10,282 deaths. There are 3,916,808 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,007,738 doses. Of those, 3,971,031 are first doses with 4,227 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,612,101 second doses, 3,816 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 304,707 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 336 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 119,899 additional or booster vaccine doses, 8,570 in the last day. The state reported 84.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

(CBS4)  – One of the sickest COVID-19 patients in Weld County, Colorado is sharing his story from his ICU bed just days after the county recently ran out of ICU beds due to a spike of cases. Earl Henry, a retired construction worker, said his thoughts on the severity of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of the vaccine drastically changed after he contracted the virus.   Now, hooked to machines that help keep him alive in the ICU, Henry wanted to share his story with KCNC-TV in Denver in hopes of encouraging other self-proclaimed skeptics to reconsider their stance.   Earl Henry (credit: CBS)   “I, from the start, was a doubter. I was the head of the doubters. I doubted the vaccines. I doubted everything the media was saying. I thought it was just a circus,” Henry said. “Now I am standing in the back of the line with my hat in my hand. I have to admit, I was wrong. I was 100% wrong.”   Hospitalized in the ICU at UCHealth Greeley Hospital, Henry admitted he regrets not taking the pandemic more seriously. Thanks to the hardworking staff at UCHealth he was able to recover enough to share his story of survival. “It is one heck of a big deal. It is a whole lot bigger than I thought,” he said. “You’ve heard the old saying of the elephant sitting on your chest? Well, I had a whole pack of them.”   Henry said he started feeling sick last month and assumed it was simply just a seasonal cold or the flu. However, as symptoms increased in severity he ultimately decided to be evaluated at the hospital.   Thanks to the quick actions of UCHealth’s staff, Henry was stabilized in the ICU. He was able to avoid being placed on a ventilator. However, that does not mean his battle with the virus has been easy. “I wouldn’t wish this on anybody,” he said. “At one point in time I could’ve cared less if I woke up or stayed asleep.”   (credit: CBS)   During his time working in construction, Henry was buried alive multiple times. Dirt walls collapsed while he was in them, and much like a boa constrictor, the dirt gained a tighter grip on him every time he exhaled. Henry said the dirt would slowly squeeze the air out of him as time passed.   Much like that experience, Henry said COVID-19 seemed to do the same as he laid in his ICU bed gasping for air. Henry said he was taking deep breaths, however, it felt like there was no oxygen. “That’s what it felt like. It literally felt like I was being suffocated,” he said.   A self-proclaimed now-former skeptic, Henry regrets not being vaccinated as soon as he qualified.   “After having it. If I knew what I know now, I would have changed a whole lot of things,” he said. “Go get the shot. A needle poke in the dang arm beats the heck out of 12 days in the ICU and wondering if you are going to make it to see the next morning,”   Henry believes if he would have been vaccinated, he could have avoided the entire near-death experience. He also said he is open to getting all three doses of the Pfizer vaccine.   Now he is thanking his doctors and nurses for giving him another chance at life, and to once again return to his favorite hobby. “I feel 110% better than I did when this started. Way better,” Henry said. “I’d like to go fishing, I feel really good.”",0.07027191558441559,0.4333739177489177,591,2021-10-12T06:32:48+00:00,2021-10-05T15:59:33+00:00,2021-10-05T15:59:33+00:00

Pittman reaffirmed his support Tuesday to mandate vaccines for students saying the current number of COVID outbreaks in schools is concerning. “It really is unacceptable that so many children are being quarantined and kept out of school as a result of positive cases in the school,” said Pittman. This comes as the county’s public schools announced two weeks ago all teachers, support staff and high school student-athletes must be vaccinated or tested weekly by Nov. 22.

Provisional data from the CDC’s  National Center for Health Statistics , released early Wednesday, suggest the homicide rate for the United States rose 30% between 2019 and 2020. It is the highest increase recorded in modern history — and confirms through public health data a rise in homicides that so far had been identified only through crime statistics. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The previous largest increase in the US homicide rate was a 20% rise recorded from 2000 to 2001 because of the September 11 terror attacks, according to NCHS. “It is the largest increase in 100 years,” Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at NCHS, said. “The only larger increase since we’ve been recording these data occurred between 1904 and 1905, and that increase was most likely — at least partly — the result of better reporting,” Anderson told CNN. “We had states being added to what we refer to as the death registration areas, so we were counting deaths in more areas over time. We didn’t have all states reporting until 1933.” The new data show the US homicide rate increased from about six homicides per 100,000 people in 2019 to 7.8 per 100,000 in 2020, according to NCHS. Researchers at the center noted that the 2020 homicide rate of 7.8 is the highest recorded in the United States since 1995 but is still significantly lower than the rates in the early 1980s, which topped 10 homicides per 100,000 people. “So, it’s obviously of concern but we’re not at the levels that we were at that time,” Anderson said. “We’re heading in the wrong direction though, for sure.” While the initial release of the NCHS preliminary data did not provide a total number of homicides from 2020, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report recorded about 21,570 murders total last year — compared with an estimated  16,425 murders in 2019. The NCHS researchers plan to conduct follow-up analyses on the new homicide data for more insight into state-level data and how the homicides occurred. For instance, the provisional data do not document the various mechanisms of homicide, but the researchers noted that provisional data on gun-related deaths also increased last year, climbing from a rate of 11.9 firearm deaths per 100,000 in 2019 to 13.6 per 100,000 in 2020 — a 14% increase. When it comes to state-by-state differences in the data, Anderson said only three states appeared to have experienced decreases in homicides last year: Maine, New Mexico and Alaska. “Those are really the only states where we saw declines,” Anderson said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Overall, the provisional homicide data are consistent with separate findings by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Last month, the FBI released its annual  Uniform Crime Report  for 2020, showing that the number of homicides increased nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year increase the agency has recorded since it began tracking these crimes in the 1960s. The climbing US homicide rate is a concerning threat to the nation’s public health — but not surprising, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told CNN. He said the rise in homicides has occurred parallel to a recent rise in overall violence, hate, tensions, political divisions and anger displayed in communities across the country. “We’re literally seeing it in front of our eyes — at school board meetings and public events,” Benjamin said. “People seem to have lost all civility, and then you couple that with having to stay home, and being stressed from that, losing your job, losing resources, fear for your health, more guns,” he said. “I think we need to figure out how we de-conflict our society.” Earlier this year, criminology experts told CNN the increase in homicides was due to several factors. The pandemic closed schools and businesses, leading to unemployment. This meant children and unemployed adults were stuck at home, leading to skyrocketing stress and anxiety levels, especially in lower-income households. The pandemic also changed the way police officers do their jobs — because of illness and social distancing — which in turn led to fewer officers on the streets in areas that needed crime prevention the most. “I think Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Eddie Bocanegra, senior director of Readi Chicago, a program that looks to aid those most affected by gun violence,  said in January . “It’s almost like these communities were just having their heads above the water,” Bocanegra said, “and then Covid hit and they just sunk.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

(AP) —  Lumped into the “Other” racial and ethnic category, American Indians and Alaska Natives are effectively invisible on Maryland’s state website for COVID-19. More than 120,000 people who identify as Native American live in Maryland, but without public-facing numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is a mystery how many the disease has affected — and how many resources should be allocated to help them. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Not only is that bad public health, but it’s also very dehumanizing for American Indians and Alaska Natives on our native lands,” Kerry Hawk Lessard, executive director of the health services nonprofit Native American Lifelines of Baltimore, said to Capital News Service. The Maryland Department of Health puts American Indians and Alaska Natives in the “Other” category for COVID-19 cases and death numbers “due to low statistical occurrence given the population of Native Americans in the state,” department spokesperson Andy Owen wrote in an email to Capital News Service. However, American Indians and Alaska Natives are at the highest risk for death and hospitalization from COVID-19 among all races and ethnicities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There is no regulation that requires this manner of reporting,” Owen wrote, when asked if any regulation requires Maryland to put American Indians and Alaska Natives in the “Other” racial and ethnic category. Race and ethnicity are self-reported data points, Owen added. However, the Maryland Department of Health does not publish the number of self-identified Native Americans or Alaska Natives who contracted COVID-19 or died from the disease. Owen did not specify which other races and ethnicities are included in the “Other” category of the state’s COVID-19 dashboard. In Maryland, 31,845 people identify as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, comprising 0.5% of the state’s total population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. “So our lives don’t matter because there aren’t enough of us?” Hawk Lessard, who identifies as a descendant of Shawnee, Assiniboine, and European people, said to Capital News Service. An additional 96,805 people in Maryland identify as American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more races, according to a Capital News Service analysis of data from the 2020 census. This group comprises an additional 1.6% of the state’s total population. Nationally, American Indian or Alaska Native people are more likely to die from COVID-19 than any other race or ethnicity, according to a September CDC report. Compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts of a similar age, American Indian or Alaska Native people are 1.7 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19, 3.5 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 2.4 times more likely to die from the disease, the CDC found. In Maryland, “there is an invisibility to Native people that is amplified by the state’s refusal” to publish COVID-19 case and death numbers for American Indians and Alaska Natives, said Hawk Lessard, who also serves as a governor-appointed member of the Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs. “It means that we don’t know what the health status of Native people is,” Hawk Lessard said, which negatively impacts COVID-19 outreach, testing and vaccination efforts. Not all Maryland jurisdictions follow the state’s example. Baltimore City, for instance, includes “American Indian or Alaska Native” and “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander” as options in its COVID-19 dashboard, though the Maryland Department of Health does not. Jennifer Hunt, a civil servant for the federal government and a former board member of Native American Lifelines, helped convince the Baltimore City Health Department last year to begin publishing Native people’s COVID-19 data. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We noticed that our race was not on the city dashboard,” said Hunt, who identifies as a descendant of the Choctaw tribe. In July 2020, Hunt co-wrote a letter with Baltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen requesting the city’s health commissioner to add American Indians and Alaska Natives to all data collection efforts. “Within 48 hours, we were up and running on the Baltimore City COVID dashboard,” Hunt said. The story is markedly different in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, where some of the largest Native populations in Maryland live, according to data from the 2020 census. Neither county’s COVID-19 dashboard lists “American Indian or Alaska Native” as a category. Like the state of Maryland, Montgomery County also puts Native people in the “Other” category. “Collapsing racial-ethnic groups with small cell counts is standard practice when reporting health data to avoid unintentionally identifying anyone,” Mary Anderson, a spokesperson for Montgomery County Health and Human Services, wrote in an email to Capital News Service. To comply with federal health privacy laws, the Montgomery County health department avoids publishing COVID-19 case and death numbers that are smaller than 25, Anderson explained. As of Sept. 15, there were 170 cases of COVID-19 among American Indians and Alaska Natives in Montgomery County, Anderson added. Though the case number was higher than 25, the county did not publish it. “The counts of cases among Native Americans were too small to allow for reporting when stratifying by other variables (age, sex, month, etc),” Anderson wrote. Adrian Dominguez, chief data officer at the Urban Indian Health Institute, told Capital News Service that he disagrees with the county’s decision to not publish the data. According to Dominguez, the department can publish the aggregate number — 170 COVID-19 cases among American Indians and Alaska Natives in Montgomery County — without publishing the smaller numbers corresponding to those individuals’ age, sex and month of infection. “Either they don’t know what they’re doing, or they’re intentionally not wanting to show this information,” Dominguez said. In addition to Maryland, 13 other states do not clearly publish data about American Indians and Alaska Natives in their COVID-19 dashboards, according to a February report by the Urban Indian Health Institute. The states are Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. “In a world where data is dollars, erasing people from data is essentially erasing them from the system,” Meredith Raimondi, director of congressional relations and public policy at the National Council for Urban Indian Health, said to Capital News Service. “If we don’t have adequate data to show this need is there, then the money won’t come and the resources won’t come…I’ve seen in the past year and a half how much it literally impacts lives,” Raimondi said.

The percentage of people testing positive remained at 3.91%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 14 to 788. Of those hospitalized, 579 remain in acute care and 209 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 539,053 total confirmed cases and 10,282 deaths. There are 3,919,726 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,020,703 doses. Of those, 3,974,294 are first doses with 3,263 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,614,715 second doses, 2,614 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,011 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 304 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 126,683 additional or booster vaccine doses, 6,784 in the last day. The state reported 84.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

In the other, representing roughly two-thirds of the population, residents with stable jobs that let them work remotely have been able to invest. “The state’s surplus is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in programs that lift all Marylanders and help stabilize housing and other critical expenses for our lower- and middle-income families,” Franchot said.

(AP) —  From the moment doctors said she would have to undergo intensive foot surgery, Prince George’s County resident Janice Joyner knew she would have to pay for more than just a procedure. A mobility device was needed for her recovery. However, Joyner said, Medicare couldn’t cover the cost of the scooter. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “I was searching online for some kind of equipment that could help me and I didn’t want to pay an arm and a leg for it,” she said. After numerous Google searches, she said she came across the Maryland Durable Medical Equipment Re-Use Program. This program provides Maryland residents with donated equipment — such as wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, scooters and even pediatric equipment that have been sanitized and repaired — at no cost. Applicants do not have to meet any income requirements to receive equipment. Marylanders with any disability, illness or injury can receive this equipment regardless of age, according to the program website. Joyner said she thought the program was too good to be true. “At first I was skeptical (wondering) ‘Why is this place offering free resources?’,” she said. “But everything on there was true and I was amazed.” Disability healthcare costs in Maryland can reach as high as $21,118 per person each year, according to a 2019 Disability and Health Data report the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued. After a month and a half of mobility assistance, Joyner said, she plans on returning her scooter to the program’s headquarters for another person to use. “Before, I could only hop five steps to my bathroom and back,” she said. “Having this scooter made it possible for me to get out of bed. ” Ten percent of Maryland adults have a mobility-related disability, according to the CDC report. This makes it the highest reported disability among other types such as cognitive, self-care and independent living. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Program Director Ian Edwards said despite numerous attempts to raise awareness for this program, many people still don’t know it exists. “We started things up in January but with COVID fears, we weren’t really sure how the program would be perceived because it is previously used equipment,” he said. Once the majority of Marylanders received their vaccines, Edwards said more equipment started going out to the public in March. “We faced a lot of difficulties at the start,” he said. “But the equipment is (now) here and we have it ready for people who have no other means of obtaining it.” Edwards said the program has received over 5,000 items since collections began. Although the program does not currently deliver, he said they have multiple satellite sites around the state where people can pick up equipment. The program hosts 11 donation centers across the state, including three major landfills where people can drop off equipment. Edwards told Capital News Service that they partnered with county landfills to set up containers and raise awareness for the re-use program. He said while the program serves to help residents, they also want to ease financial strains among other contributors. “Whether it’s the healthcare system, hospital providers or even Medicare,” he said. “If we can save them money, with the inventory we have now, we’re hoping to help in any way.” Secretary of Aging Rona Kramer said Maryland is the first state to offer this statewide durable reuse program. “There are very few programs in the country that are this expansive,” she said. “We have the most sophisticated one. We are giving people their lives back.” More information about the program:  https://aging.maryland.gov/pages/DME.aspx MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

He’s charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 83-year-old Rebecca Reynolds, who was found dead Sept. 29 in a Cumberland home. At the time Reynolds’ body was discovered, her vehicle was missing. Howard County authorities on Wednesday charged Burnham with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and one handgun charge in the death of his brother and Brian’s wife Kelly. According to charging documents, Burnham’s mother Evelyn called the Cumberland Police Department on Sept. 29 because her son was making statements about the FBI coming after them and she was concerned “regarding his mental health and stability.” As part of the investigation into Reynolds’ death, Cumberland police contacted Howard County authorities on Sept. 30 with a search warrant for a residence at 5368 Kerger Road in Ellicott City.

Evelyn Burnham called police a second time and told authorities her son had told her he needed to return Reynolds’ car. She also told police Jeffrey wanted to confront his brother about the COVID-19 vaccine, believing the government was using the shot to poison people. A tipster contacted Maryland State Police and said Burnham appeared at their house in a red Corvette around 4:45 p.m. on Sept. 30 asking for gas money.

(KOVR-TV) –  A Sacramento couple is leaving the state because they claim they’re fed up with California in more ways than one.

If you wear a mask, the transmissibility of the virus is greatly reduced.","BEL AIR, Md. (WJZ)  — A new study conducted by the CDC shows children in schools where there is no mask mandate have a higher chance of contracting COVID. To some, this is a no-brainer. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “If you wear a mask, the transmissibility of the virus is greatly reduced,” said William Brown, who has school-aged nieces and nephews. In fact, the study shows in schools with a mask mandate the number of kids infected daily, per 100,000, was about 16. That number is about 35 per100,000 kids in schools with no mandate. Some parents say masks don’t hurt. “They spread a lot of germs anyway, so whatever we can do to kind of eliminate as much of that as possible, I think, is really positive,” said Jasmine Mays-Robinson, who has school-aged children. Do masks stop the spread completely? No, but the chief medical information officer for LifeBridge Health said they help keep positive cases low. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “There still might be a positive kid here or there who has to be out for a week or two, but we haven’t seen it going rampantly through because most schools have been vigilant about masking and then quarantining if someone comes up positive,” said Dr. Jonathan Theirman. WJZ told you about  a rally in Carroll County , organized by parents fighting the mask mandate as their county was one of the only with optional masking before the state stepped in. Now, masks are  mandated in all Maryland public schools . Leaders in Prince George’s County are taking it a step further, now requiring everyone ages 2 and up to wear masks anywhere indoors. Previously, the mandate was for anyone 5 or older. “As a parent, I understand it, I get it, I know it’s not easy to mask younger children. But we’re doing this based on the data we have and out of a grave concern for our children, many of whom are getting sick,” said Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks.

In an exclusive interview Wednesday with WJZ, the mayor opened up about the symptoms he’s dealt with since getting his test results back. He also underscored the need for city residents to get vaccinated to avoid the worst effects of the infection. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Yesterday, I had a few body aches, but today I feel totally normal,” Scott told WJZ. Besides those aches, the mayor — who had his last public event over the weekend at Patterson Park — said he hasn’t suffered from any other symptoms, such as fever or nausea. “Because of the vaccine, I’m able to do this interview at home and not in a hospital bed, not on the ventilator,” Scott said. Based on his experience, he encouraged everyone to do everything in their power to stay healthy amid the pandemic. That means undergoing testing and getting the vaccine if residents haven’t already done so. “Get tested,” Scott said. “Get vaccinated. Protect yourself at all costs.” As WJZ previously reported, the mayor was vaccinated against the virus in March. His positive test results make him part of the 1 percent of vaccinated Marylanders to get what’s known as a breakthrough case. It’s worth mentioning that the COVID-19 vaccine does not protect against infection. Rather, the vaccine is intended to ward off the worst effects of the virus and keep people out of the hospital. Asked if there was something he would do differently, Scott said he would step up his efforts to protect himself while out in public spaces. “For me, I guess it’d be taking my mask-wearing to the next level,” he said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The mayor, who is routinely tested, said he is grateful that testing regimen caught his infection early. He took a rapid test Monday morning, followed by a PCR test, which is considered the gold standard for tests. Last week, Scott attended a leadership conference in New York, traveling there by Amtrak train. He said mask usage was enforced in both spaces. He’s uncertain when he was exposed to the virus. But he suspects it might have occurred on Saturday, the day attended a groundbreaking where he alternated between wearing a mask and going without it. The next day, Scott attended the Parade of Latino Nations in East Baltimore. “When you see pictures of me outside without a mask, that’s very rare, too,” Scott said. “Even from some of the events over the weeks, folks are like, ‘He didn’t have on a mask.’ There are pictures of me at the same event with a mask,” he said. The mayor told WJZ he’s been cooperating with contracting tracing, which entails tracking down people with whom he had close contact over prolonged periods. Few people are considered close contacts. “Fifteen minutes, within six feet of each other, having a conversation. That’s that close contact, but not the quick passing, ‘Hi, bye,” said Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Dzirasa. Dr. Dzirasa said the mayor’s infection speaks to the need for unvaccinated residents to get the shot. “When we look at who’s been hospitalized with COVID-19, the vast majority are unvaccinated individuals. I actually think this is a reminder of how important it is to get vaccinated,” she said.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased by 0.02% to 3.89%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations remained at 792. Of those hospitalized, 577 remain in acute care and 209 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 540,451 total confirmed cases and 10,320 deaths. There are 3,925,281 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,044,296 doses. Of those, 3,979,978 are first doses with 5,684 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,620,024 second doses, 5,309 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,257 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 247 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 139,037 additional or booster vaccine doses, 12,354 in the last day. The state reported 84.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Larry Hogan Announces Framework To Use Maryland’s $2.5B Budget Surplus,CBS Baltimore Staff,CBS Baltimore,Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has called a news conference Thursday afternoon to issue an update on the state's budget.,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) —  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday announced a five-point framework to use the state’s $2.5 billion budget surplus. The surplus, announced by Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot last week, is about 25 times the amount of money the state usually has left over. The bulk of the surplus was attributed to stimulus funding and higher-than-anticipated tax collections. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Democrats on Wednesday called for the money to be spent on those most in need,  families who are struggling to make ends meet and facing eviction. “Already some politicians see this (surplus) as a chance to go on a big spending spree with pet projects, big payouts to special interests and new mandated increases in spending,” Hogan said Thursday. “That is not going to happen on my watch.” Hogan said his plan would entail the following: increasing the state’s reserves, providing major tax relief for retirees and direct tax relief to Marylanders in general   Increasing the state’s reserves, or Rainy Day fund;   Providing major tax relief for the state’s retirees;   Offering direct tax relief to Marylanders in general;   Giving additional relief to underserved residents;   And boosting pay for state employees.   The state aims to shore up the Rainy Day fund by at least 7.5% to $1.67 billion. Hogan described tax relief for retirees as a priority — and the only way to keep them from leaving Maryland for states with lower taxes. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Cutting retirement taxes is one of the most important things we can do and something we have been trying to accomplish for seven years. But the legislature has failed to support this critical relief for seniors,” Hogan said. “Each year when I have proposed it. Legislators have spent almost immediately rejected it saying that we can’t afford it. Now with our fiscal health stronger than ever before, what we cannot afford is failing again to take immediate action to ease the crippling tax burden on our retirees.” Hogan said as the state puts its budget together it will continue to provide additional, targeted relief for those Marylanders who need it the most. He did not specify whether that measure fall in line with Democrats’ call to action. The governor also spoke to the need to properly compensate state employees who “have been unwavering in their commitment throughout our COVID-19 response.” He said his budgetary plan demonstrates an effort to practice fiscal discipline while prioritizing relief. “My message is pretty simple,” Hogan said. “As long as I am governor, I will continue to fight for fiscal discipline. I will continue working hard every single day to make it easier for Maryland families, small businesses and retirees to stay in our state, and I will continue fighting to allow Marylanders to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pockets, so that we can continue changing Maryland for the better.”   MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government",0.07457415772633165,0.4300159984942594,512,2021-10-12T06:33:04+00:00,2021-10-07T13:24:22+00:00,2021-10-07T13:24:22+00:00

BR-  Yeah, no, I felt maybe a little bit too comfortable. I love the country, I love the elements being thrown at me. Let me dig and salvage and scrap and eat worms and just go. I felt good. What I didn’t feel prepared for was that first loss in the immunity challenge. I was not prepared for that five hour scramble of passing the boat and that killed me, that was hard on me. MW-  We saw the introduction of the Beware Advantage last night. So I know you felt pretty prepared but when those twists get thrown in how difficult is it to think on the spot and process that new information? BR-  yes, I was a little disappointed in myself. I thought about it and maybe I can blame the lack of food and calories because I didn’t quite process how how brutal that was. I knew I was helpless, I knew I had all my power stripped and I was in trouble,  but I was not quite prepared for that. I hadn’t seen through that part of it. MW-  One of my favorite moments from last night was you and Xander communicating through codewords. Can you walk me through that? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn BR-  Oh yeah, I loved it. You know I completely messed up my statement, completely butchered it, so I’m feeling bad. The challenge was and your emotions are high, your energy’s high. Then there’s Xander, and it didn’t even cross my mind, but he leans over and says ‘like what you said about the broccoli.’ I was like dude, yes, you and I have this little connection and that’s what you’re looking for in this game is any little connection. He looked like such a cool dude right there and all of  a sudden he and I have this connection and I was very excited about it at the time. MW-  Now the part I’m sorry to bring up but we get to tribal council, things don’t go your way, can you walk me through how things went from your perspective? BR-  It was total slow motion, Matt. I felt like things were in slow motion and I was thinking oh, JD is not nervous, this is not going well for me. Next I was just trying to think what can I do, what can I do, and came up with a blank, I can do nothing. I had no immunity, no shot in the dark, I’ve got nothing but Genie. All I had was Genie, and I’m like, can I give her my steal a vote, I don’t know if that would help? My mind was just kind of moving too slow. When you you picture yourself out there and you put yourself in these situations you think I’ll go to a tribal and fight for any chance I can get to win. I did not prepare for that situation though, if I have all my power stripped on a five person council, only four votes left; I did not prepare for that. I just couldn’t move like I wanted to. MW-  A lot of fans were sorry to see you go, any chance we’ll see you out there for another round? BR-  Great question, I feel like I’ve had my shot, I took my turn. I loved every second of it and if Jeff called me I absolutely would say yes man, sign me up, I’ll go tomorrow. I also feel like man, I had my shot, I love  Survivor , but I had my chance. I look at the seven days I had and I feel like I lived a whole season worth of game play. I’m catching some flak from people saying I played too strong, too sloppy but I got no regrets. I had my people in position, I was playing the game I wanted. I feel like that monster that Jeff keeps talking about, that’s what it really was. If I had been powered up I think it would have been a different outcome last night, I could have outran that monster. MW-  It’s been a monster for sure. Thank you so much for the time today Brad, great to talk to you and all the best moving forward! BR-  Awesome, thank you Matt pleasure.

(WJZ) —  Court records suggest medical misinformation might have been the motive behind last week’s double murder in Howard County. Jeffrey Burnham of Cumberland  is charged in the murders of his brother and sister-in-law, Brian and Kelly Robinette, who were found shot to death Sept. 30 inside the couple’s Ellicott City home. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured According to Howard County police, Burnham traveled to his relatives’ home after killing another individual, 83-year-old Rebecca Reynolds, in Allegany County. Charging documents obtained by WJZ show Burnham’s mother told investigators  her son had expressed a desire to confront his brother , a pharmacist,  about administering COVID-19 vaccines . “He wanted to confront Brian about the government poisoning people with COVID vaccines,” Burnham’s mother told police. “He repeatedly stated, ‘Brian knows something!'” The Robinettes’ murders could have been prevented, according to Anjali Kataria, chief executive officer for Mytonomy, a Bethesda-based medical education company. “There are accurate sources of information and we weren’t able to get them to this individual,” Kataria told WJZ. “It’s a real tragedy.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn She said the most effective way to stamp out medical misinformation is to steer people away from unverified information found online and toward real medical authorities: doctors and public health experts. While some side effects have been reported among vaccine recipients, those instances have been rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which deems the shots both “safe and effective.” “It’s a staggering fact because the science behind the vaccine is so good,” Kataria said. “We know that it works.” A day after the Robinettes were found dead, Burnham was taken into custody in West Virginia, where he was found with the couple’s Corvette. Police said a gun was recovered from the car. The  46-year-old was extradited to Maryland this week , where he faces first-degree murder charges in the deaths of the Robinettes and Reynolds.

Tafe showed an example of one vaccination card they seized that misspelled COVID on the fake vaccination cards. He said these cards were purchased from China and mailed to Maryland, a federal crime, with hundreds of cards meant to be sold for profit for anywhere from $500 to $2500. “It’s a threat to public safety,” Tafe said.

Currently, the vaccine is only approved for anyone over the age of 12, but by the end of the month that could be changing. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured If approved, doctors explain children under 12 would get about 1/3 of the dosage of vaccine administered to an adult. Dr. Esther Liu, Chair of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center, said, “the risk of the illness itself far exceeds the risk of the vaccine.” She said she is disheartened to see young COVID patients, struggling as they fight the virus. She said parents should talk to their health care provider; “what we thankfully have not seen are any major complications of the vaccine, but it’s a risk benefit-I never promise my families anything is 100% effective or 100% safe.” Some parents and grandparents said they want the children in their life vaccinated, for their own safety and the safety of their family. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Others think the risk is too great, citing the known rare side effect of myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle. One woman told WJZ, “I think it’s dangerous for the older kids, we’ve seen myocarditis, so I think it’s a risk and I don’t think it should be allowed.” Vaccines have been available for children 12 and up since May, but only 50% of 16 and 17 year-olds are vaccinated. 43% of kids ages 12-15 have gotten the shots. As children attend school with their peers, transmission in the classroom is a top concern for health officials who are now seeing about 25% of weekly COVID cases are children. Dr. Liu said there has been a 25% increase in weekly pediatric COVID cases since early on in the pandemic when the younger age group was less susceptible to the disease. Now that kids are back in school, interacting with their peers, she said it is crucial they be protected. “The impact of this will be really able to protect our school-aged kids,” Dr. Liu said.

Would a fourth stimulus check help?,"( CBS Detroit ) —   The pandemic continues, well after COVID first shut down the economy. The Delta variant is driving up case numbers among the unvaccinated. President Biden is instituting stronger efforts to encourage vaccines, as case numbers are felt across certain segments of the economy. Some people have yet to experience any real improvement. Unemployment still exceeds pre-pandemic levels, even with jobs widely available in certain sectors. The federal unemployment bonus ended over a month ago. Millions of people remain short of food and behind on bills, and a fourth stimulus check could help. A few places, including California, have recognized that need for additional help and provided additional payments. But will the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) be sending out another stimulus check in 2021? That question hasn’t been answered definitively. But plenty of clues point where things are heading. Economic Recovery For Some READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Relief payments were intended to ease COVID’s economic impact and support the economy in the process. The third round of relief payments started back in March, courtesy of the American Rescue Plan (ARP). Over the following months, about  169 million people  received up to $1,400 each. That accounted for nearly all of the $422 billion set aside. The ARP checks closely followed the $600 payments from January, which came nine months after the $1,200 payments from the pandemic’s early days. They seem to have worked, but have also helped many who didn’t actually need the money. In the second quarter of 2021, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of  6.7 percent , according to the most recent estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. ( Supply shortages  may have prevented even faster growth.) That continues the torrid pace from the first quarter, which saw 6.4 percent growth. The  Conference Board  forecasts continued though slower growth through the rest of the year. The country’s  gross domestic product  (GDP), an estimate of economic activity across the U.S., has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. By that general measure, the economy has fully recovered. Broad segments of the workforce have endured little economic hardship during the pandemic. Many jobs performed at a desk in an office are just as easily performed at a desk in someone’s home. And with fewer places to spend money during much of the pandemic, plus three stimulus checks, many Americans saved more than they might have otherwise. The personal saving rate ballooned to 33.7 percent in April of 2020 and has remained well above pre-pandemic levels ever since. In August of 2021, it sat at  9.4 percent , still above the 8.3 percent from February of 2020, the month before the pandemic started. On  Face the Nation  back in June, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan  estimated  that its customers had not spent 65-70 percent of their last two stimulus checks. That extra savings combined with pent-up demand has likely helped drive the broader economy during the rebound. The  housing market  has also surged, thanks to low interest rates and people stuck at home realizing the limitations of their living space. The National Association of Realtors recently reported that the national median sales price for an existing home hit $356,700 in August, up 14.9 percent from August of 2020. Much of that rise was helped along by houses priced above the median. Housing inventory decreased over July, and was down 13.4 percent year over year. And of the homes that sold in August, 87 percent were for sale for less than a month. The stock market continues to perform well too. Despite a bumpy week, Dow Jones remains far above where it was at this time last year. It has regularly approached record territory. The market opened Friday morning at 34,757 as compared to 28,425 at this time a year ago. Concerns about the Delta variant and lagging vaccination rates in parts of the world still linger. COVID case numbers continue to rise, and mask guidelines have become more stringent in some parts of the country, thanks to the Delta variant. But the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) full approval of the Pfizer vaccine, along with the approval of booster shots for those at risk or over 65 yeas old, has been good news for the market. Individual investors who saved their stimulus cash remain invested. Bigger investors continue to bet on a strong economic recovery in the months ahead. While certain experts foresee some of the strongest economic growth in decades, many are also a little concerned about higher inflation. Recent projections indicate that prices will rise about  5.3 percent  in 2021. That’s compared to the 2.3 percent rate in 2019 and 1.7 percent rate in 2020. The latest data shows prices rising  5.3 percent  over the last 12 months. Should that rate persist for the rest of the year, it would be the highest in three decades. That possibility has become less likely of late. Prices moved up 0.3 percent in August, a slowdown from previous months. Core consumer prices — excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile — rose only 0.1 percent. Nevertheless, rising prices continue for many products that require semiconductors, including new cars, computers, and TVs. Price hikes and product shortages stem, in part, from the economy opening up all at once. Prices depressed by the pandemic have had to normalize. But companies couldn’t keep pace with a year’s worth of pent-up consumer demand. They also have had to revive and retool their supply chains in the midst of drastic changes in consumer demand patterns. And this has all happened as shipping issues and other constraints continue to slow production and delivery. COVID has altered how and what people consume. The way these changes continue to play out isn’t necessarily predictable. Companies, however, have had to guess where demand for their product will be when all the dust settles. Predicting the future is hard enough in a normal economy. It became much harder in an economy trying to move past a pandemic then forced to deal with a resurgence. Price changes and shortages across a whole range of products will likely continue to plague consumers in the short-term. But economists think they should improve with time. Consumer spending  is picking up again, with the rate up 0.8 percent in August, as compared to a 0.1 percent drop in July. Demand for travel and leisure continued to ease with the rise of the Delta variant. Spending on food and household supplies rebounded. New car purchases continue to be a drag, with semiconductor shortages still creating production and supply issues. Overall, goods spending remains above pre-pandemic levels, but could also be showing the effects  Delta variant  concerns. No Economic Recovery For Others The pandemic has further highlighted the growing imbalance across the broader economy. While many households have financially flourished during COVID, many others have fallen behind where they were in early 2020. Much of the gap depends on whether wage earners could work remotely during the shutdown or had public-facing jobs that required them to be on-site. Financial insecurity is still widespread, and the loss of a job and the loss of hours were some of the main reasons over the course of the pandemic. Nine percent of American adults (approximately 20 million people) reported a  shortage of food  in their household over the previous week, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of U.S. Census survey data from late September. Approximately 14 percent of renters (10.3 million people) have fallen behind on their rent, including 21 percent of renters with children in their household. The federal  eviction moratorium , which ended October 3, didn’t forgive rent that was owed, it pushed the debt into the future. And  evictions continued  in some parts of the country regardless. Meanwhile, only a fraction of the $46 billion Congress allocated for rental assistance has actually made it to tenants and landlords. As of late September, over a quarter of American adults (63 million people) reported some difficulty keeping up with expenses in the prior week. Employment also remains below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate fell to  4.8 percent  in September, with some workers finding jobs or leaving the workforce. Job growth continues to fall short of expectations. Forecasters expected roughly 490,000 new jobs in September, but employers only added about 194,000. (August saw about 366,000 new jobs.) Many fear the rise of the Delta variant is hindering growth. Low-wage jobs made up the bulk of those lost during the pandemic, and while plenty of openings have returned, many remain unfilled. Approximately  326,000 people  initially applied for unemployment insurance in the week ending October 2. (A typical pre-pandemic week saw about 250,000 new unemployment applications.) As of the week ending September 18, close to 4.2 million workers were receiving some form of unemployment aid. (The approximately 4.9 million people previously collecting PUA  lost benefits  on September 6, when the program ended.) Many jobless Americans have not received unemployment insurance and other government benefits, because of long waits, perceived ineligibility and other issues. Job growth still faces some headwinds, aside from the Delta variant. Some have argued that overly generous benefits made unemployment more attractive than working. But other considerations factor into one’s ability to work too. Remote schooling created childcare issues for many parents that summer break didn’t change. The resumption of in-person learning, if it lasts, could free up some parents to return to work. The full vaccination rate is  56.2 percent  for the country. But state percentages range from 69.8 percent in Vermont to 40.6 percent in West Virginia. Many counties across the country have vaccination rates lower than that. The threat of COVID, particularly the now-dominant Delta variant, is still real in places. Many people are uncomfortable working in public around strangers. A gap between labor force skills and job requirements can make hiring more difficult, not to mention the rising standards of what workers will accept in a job. And then there’s the general friction that inevitably arises when an entire economy slams its foot on the gas. As before the pandemic, many who are willing to work cannot find jobs with the wages and benefits they need to survive. According to  Marie Newman , a U.S. Representative from Illinois, “there is not a shortage of Americans looking for work, there is a shortage of Americans willing to work for starvation wages with no benefits, no health care, and no protections during a pandemic.” About half of all states tried to force the issue and push people back into the job market. These states, most led by Republicans, discontinued the $300  federal unemployment benefit bonus  for their citizens ahead of the official Labor Day end date, or at least attempted to. Analysis from a payroll services company called  Gusto  showed that cutting off federal benefits didn’t lead to  more hiring . The federal unemployment bonus and the previous round of stimulus checks helped Americans still awaiting their recovery to pay bills and put food on the table. The advance Child Tax Credit provides some additional support to families. But this money only goes so far. And some politicians feel that the payments haven’t been enough. Support For A Fourth Stimulus Check A group of Democratic Senators, including Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, sent a  letter to President Joe Biden  at the end of March requesting “recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions.” As the Senators reasoned in their letter, “this crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. Families should not be at the mercy of constantly-shifting legislative timelines and ad hoc solutions.” An earlier letter to  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris  from 53 Representatives, led by  Ilhan Omar  of Minnesota, carved out a similar position. “Recurring direct payments until the economy recovers will help ensure that people can meet their basic needs, provide racially equitable solutions, and shorten the length of the recession.” Additional co-signers included New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib, two other notable names among House Progressives. The letter didn’t place a number on the requested stimulus payments. But a tweet soon after put it at $2,000 per month for the length of the pandemic.   $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic is over.  https://t.co/6tuia6prFJ   — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN)  January 28, 2021 A  May 17 letter  from members of the House Ways and Means Committee renewed the push for additional stimulus. “The ARP’s $1,400 checks alone will keep 11 million people out of poverty this year, with UI (unemployment insurance) expansion and other provisions in the bill accounting for the another five million. A fourth and fifth check could keep an additional 12 million out of poverty. Combined with the effects of the ARP, direct payments could reduce the number in poverty in 2021 from 44 million to 16 million.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn There’s also been talk about  automatic payments  that could be sent when specific economic metrics reach certain thresholds (for example, if unemployment rises to 6 percent). These triggers would make stimulus checks a reactive force in countering economic dips, sparing struggling Americans from Congressional delays. A majority of Americans also favor recurring relief payments. According to a January poll from  Data For Progress , nearly two-thirds of all voters support $2,000 monthly payments to all Americans for the length of the pandemic. Supporters include a majority of Independents and Republicans. A struggling restaurant owner’s  online petition  calling for $2,000 monthly payments for every American adult has surpassed 2.9 million signatures. The  Urban Institute  estimated that another stimulus payment could reduce poverty by at least 6.4 percent in 2021. Many economists are also onboard. A 2020  open letter  from experts in the field argued “direct cash payments are an essential tool that will boost economic security, drive consumer spending, hasten the recovery, and promote certainty at all levels of government and the economy – for as long as necessary.” California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a  new budget  into law in July, which includes a stimulus check for about two-thirds of the state’s residents. The $100 billion California Comeback Plan, as part of their  $262.2 billion budget , is paying $600 to residents earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year. Residents in that income range who have kids are receiving $1,100. Those checks  started going out  the last Friday in August The state’s previous stimulus went to those with an annual income under $30,000. Other states have also authorized payments.  Maryland handed out  $300 or $500 checks to those who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on their tax returns.  Florida gave  $1,000 bonuses to teachers, which started showing up in August. Denton and Irving school districts in  north Texas  were scheduled to give retention bonuses of $500 and $2,000 respectively at the start of the school year. The Biden administration is also planning to give a one-time  $600 payment  to farm workers and meatpacking workers. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the plan in early September. The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated up to $700 million for the limited-scope stimulus check. The aid will be handed out through state agencies and include a pilot program giving extra money to grocery store workers. The Biden administration, which authored the third round of stimulus checks, isn’t against a fourth round. But the president recognizes their high price tag. He also has other priorities, specifically infrastructure and help for families. Neither the American Jobs Plan nor the American Families Plan, the administration’s original infrastructure and human infrastructure proposals, included another relief payment. Other plans currently bouncing around Congress don’t either. A Fourth Stimulus Check Is Unlikely All of the tacit and explicit support for stimulus checks keeps the possibility alive. The support doesn’t make a fourth payment likely, however. And there are many reasons why. Vaccinations are progressing steadily, albeit not as quickly as in the spring. Adults and those at least 12 years old are eligible to be inoculated in all 50 states. (Trials for children under 12 continue with approval expected soon.) Three different options are available to the public, with the Pfizer vaccine fully approved by the FDA. Booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine have also been approved and rolled out for those at risk or over 65. Actually putting needles in arms is taking time, even with supply readily available. Americans have received over 399 million doses, with 65.1 percent of the population having received at least one dose and 56.2 percent completely vaccinated. Vaccination numbers continue to increase at a rate of just under a million doses per day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its guidance and recommends that vaccinated people in areas with higher COVID transmission revert to wearing  masks indoors  again. With vaccinations rising, the nation’s economy continues to recover. Looser restrictions have helped businesses, and jobs are available in many sectors. Many industries are even complaining of worker shortages, which are leading to wage increases. The number of new unemployment claims remains lower than it has been for much of the pandemic. In September,  consumer confidence  dropped again due to ongoing concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices.  Consumer sentiment  ticked up a bit last month. Confidence, however, remains higher than it’s been for much of the pandemic. Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the country’s economy. And excess pandemic savings, along with three stimulus checks, has boosted people’s spending power. That spending power has increased even more since monthly Child Tax Credit payments started on July 15. The most recent payment went out September 15. An improved financial position generally also raises optimism for the future. The ongoing vaccinations, which have allowed the economy to reopen to some degree, certainly help. All that additional spending, along with the release of pent-up demand, has led to the availability of more jobs as companies try to hire to address consumer needs. With the economy growing, a fourth round of stimulus checks seems less urgent. Aside from the generally improving economy, the political machinations of Washington make a fourth stimulus check a longshot. The American Rescue Plan, which included the third stimulus check, passed along party lines. Republicans were not interested in spending anywhere close to $1.9 trillion, though some did support the third relief payment. They termed the package a “blue state bailout,” claiming it went well beyond the scope of COVID and would increase the deficit, leading to inflation. The Democrats used a process called  reconciliation  to pass the bill in the Senate without Republican support. That allows budget-related matters to proceed with a simple majority rather than the filibuster-proof 60 votes. Generally only one reconciliation bill can pass per fiscal year. But a subsequent ruling by the  Senate parliamentarian , who interprets the legislative body’s rules, opened up a path for additional spending legislation. Without reconciliation, any bill would need at least 10 Republican votes, along with every Democratic vote. But the Biden administration has other priorities. One of its biggest is addressing infrastructure. The proposed  American Jobs Plan , which aimed to rebuild roads, repair bridges, do away with lead pipes, extend broadband, modernize the country’s electric grid and much more, carried a price tag of $2.3 trillion. Biden and a group of Senators from both parties agreed upon a scaled-back infrastructure plan costing about $1 trillion. The resulting bipartisan bill, now called the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , passed the Senate in early August. Neither the original version nor the bipartisan bill that moved forward includes a fourth stimulus check. One could, in theory, be added when the House takes up the bill. That seems unlikely given the price tag. The American Families Plan, focused on childcare, education and more, would have cost another $1.8 trillion in its initial form. The Democrats are now pushing forward a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that focuses on their various “human infrastructure” initiatives, such as Medicare expansion, child care, and climate change. A fourth stimulus check is not included, though one could theoretically still be added as well. The Democrats’ extended plan is a more likely home for a fourth stimulus check than a traditional infrastructure plan. Funding these plans will almost certainly involve tax increases on corporations and wealthy individuals, which Republicans would oppose. Plenty more negotiating seems inevitable before any bill gets passed into law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised not to take up the infrastructure bill until the Senate also passes the human infrastructure bill. Democrats are already laying the groundwork to use reconciliation again to push through this legislation. Joe Manchin  of West Virginia, among the most centrist Democratic Senators, has warned against overusing reconciliation. He is also apparently unwilling to do away with the filibuster, which would lower the number of votes needed to pass legislation to 51. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema doesn’t want to abandon the filibuster either. Manchin also wants to see the human infrastructure bill shrink. With bipartisanship still hard to come by, the Biden administration is in a tough spot. They’re unlikely to add a fourth stimulus check to any plan, driving up the price tag by hundreds of billions of dollars. They’re also unlikely to use reconciliation to pass another stimulus check on its own. What Other Aid Is Out There? While a fourth stimulus check is improbable, more direct payments to Americans have already been signed into law. Up until Labor Day, the jobless received extended unemployment benefits. The American Rescue Plan also includes an advance Child Tax Credit. Under the revised Child Tax Credit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is paying out $3,600 per year for each child up to five years old and $3,000 per year for each child ages six through 17. Monthly payments of up to $300 per child started July 15 and will continue through December of 2021. The remainder is to be issued when the recipient files their 2021 taxes. The benefit does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. In other words, qualifying families will receive the full amount, regardless of how much — or little — they owe in taxes. Payments start to phase out beyond a $75,000 annual income for individuals and beyond $150,000 for married couples. The more generous credit will apply only for 2021, though Biden has stated his interest in extending it through 2025. The ARP added $21.6 billion to the  Emergency Rental Assistance Program , which is being distributed to state and local governments, who then assist households. Most of the $46 billion total has yet to reach tenants and landlords. The infrastructure and human infrastructure plans also have the potential to create many jobs across a wide swath of the economy. How the proposed initiatives are ultimately distributed across the bipartisan bill or the broader Democratic plan remains to be seen. The American Families Plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave that could have reached as high as $4,000 per month, depending on a worker’s income. It also boosted the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and placed a ceiling on the cost of childcare for many families. The plan set aside $200 billion for universal preschool. In addition to helping working parents pay for childcare, the plan sought to allow more parents to return to the workforce. Look for similar programs and more when the specifics of the human infrastructure plan are worked out. Additional money in people’s pockets from any bill or proposed plan is still hypothetical, of course. Nothing has found its way through Congress yet. And it could be months until it does.

https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/10/08/covid-19-in-maryland-6/,,"COVID-19 In Maryland: Over 1,300 Cases Reported, 13 New Deaths",CBS Baltimore Staff,CBS Baltimore,The percentage of people testing positive decreased by 0.11% to 3.78%.,"BALTIMORE (WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,176 new COVID-19 cases and 13 new deaths, according to state health department data released Friday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased by 0.11% to 3.78%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations dropped by one to 791. Of those hospitalized, 594 remain in acute care and 190 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 541,627 total confirmed cases and 10,333 deaths. There are 3,929,284 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,061,754 doses. Of those, 3,984,466 are first doses with 4,488 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,623,716 second doses, 3,692 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,568 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 311 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 148,004 additional or booster vaccine doses, 8,967 in the last day. The state reported 84.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

On Thursday, the hip hop star shared behind-the-scenes photos of the two of them on the set of the highly anticipated event. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “GUESS WHO BTCHS?!!!!! #Andiconda #RHOP COMING SOON ON @BRAVOTV @bravoandy 😌🙏😍✨ #Moment4Life,” the 38-year-old star wrote on Instagram alongside the carousel of pictures. Back in July, Minaj shared a trailer for the show, in which the cast talked about their lives with remixed lyrics of her hit track, “Moment 4 Life.” “I’ll be hosting the reunion. 🥳 lmk what y’all want me to ask chile🥴,” the caption read. However, Minaj has provoked plenty of controversy since then, making headlines for her anti-vax comments. Last month, the “Super Bass” hitmaker suggested in a tweet to her 22.9 million followers that Covid-19 vaccines cause impotence, despite the fact there is no link between the vaccines and infertility. After revealing that she was not attending the Met Gala in New York City because of the Covid-19 vaccine requirement, she shared an unverified story about a friend of her cousin in Trinidad becoming impotent after getting a Covid-19 shot. “His testicles became swollen,” Minaj claimed in a tweet that quickly went viral. Just over 54% of the total US population is vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I’m seeing videos of her walking around without a mask on and not socially distancing. Seems very irresponsible on their behalf,” one commentator wrote on Twitter. Another said: “It makes absolutely no sense to have her host the reunion.” However, other viewers welcomed the idea of seeing Minaj in the hosting chair. One simply reposted the picture of Minaj and Cohen with the caption: “Obsessed 😍 #RHOP @Andy @NICKIMINAJ.” Another added: “This gonna be so freaking epic&awesome @NICKIMINAJ @Andy @BravoTV.” CNN has contacted Bravo and Andy Cohen’s representatives for comment.

More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations dropped by eight to 783. Of those hospitalized, 592 remain in acute care and 191 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 542,886 total confirmed cases and 10,353 deaths. There are 3,933,168 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,079,021 doses. Of those, 3,988,796 are first doses with 4,330 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,627,348 second doses, 3,632 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,820 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 252 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 157,057 additional or booster vaccine doses, 9,053 in the last day.

In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

But the positivity rate did go down to 3.7 percent and more Marylanders are choosing to get vaccinated.   The virus continues to be a serious concern for health officials in Maryland. The state is reporting more than 1,000 new cases each day.   And for anyone who’s not vaccinated there’s still a higher risk of hospitalization and death.   That’s why they’re continuing to hold these vaccine clinics to get everyone protected.   The push to get Marylanders vaccinated against COVID-19 is not letting up.   “We want to make sure that we are doing our part to knock down COVID-19,” said Paul Finley, AIM chairman for Greater Maryland First Jurisdiction, the Auxiliaries and Ministries.   Greater Emmanuel Ministries Church of God in Christ on Saturday hosted a walk-up vaccine clinic with the Maryland Department of Health.   About 50 percent of this community has received at least one shot of the vaccine.   But church leaders want to try to get more people protected.   “I know that there’s some controversy as to if people want to get vaccinated or not. But we want to tell you that the science has proven that it’s a safe endeavor,” Finley said.   Statewide, over 64 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.   In Baltimore, the COVID transmission level remains high. And the need to get more people vaccinated remains important.   “We can help each other by being vaccinated,” Finley said.   Covid-19 Vaccines remain available 7 days a week, across Baltimore and Maryland.   Both the  city  and  state health  department have a list of vaccination clinics posted online for anyone to find out how to get their shot.

And hopefully it’s going to continue to go in that trajectory downward,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “But we just have to be careful we don’t prematurely declare victory in many respects. We still have around 68 million people who are eligible to be vaccinated that have not yet gotten vaccinated,” Fauci said Sunday. “If you look at the history of the surges and the diminutions in the cases over a period of time, they can bounce back.” In 45 states, the rates of new Covid-19 cases either declined or stayed relatively steady this past week compared to the previous week, according to data Saturday from Johns Hopkins University. Five states — Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania — had at least 10% more new cases this past week compared to the previous week. In Michigan, an emergency room physician said his hospital is still overwhelmed with patients. “I had just worked a couple of shifts in a row where I had six, seven people sitting in the emergency department, waiting for beds at other hospitals that didn’t exist,” Dr. Rob Davidson said Saturday. He said some ambulances “were six, seven hours away from being able to bring them to those places.” About 52% of Michigan residents have been fully vaccinated — lower than the national average of 56.4%, according to data Saturday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).   ‘Still way too high’ New Covid-19 cases are going “in the right direction — we have less than 100,000 cases a day,” Fauci said Sunday. But the US has about 95,000 new infections reported daily, which is “still way too high,” he said. “I would like to see it well below 10,000 and even much lower than that,” Fauci said. “But when you’re at 95,000, that’s still a situation where you have a high degree of dynamic circulation of virus.” And while daily Covid-19 deaths have declined in recent weeks, an average of more than 1,600 Americans are dying from Covid-19 every day, according to data this past week from Johns Hopkins University.   Death isn’t the only terrible outcome with Covid-19 It’s important for people to understand “not dying from Covid is a great thing, but that isn’t the only metric we should be using,” Davidson said. He said at his hospital, some Covid-19 patients have been on a ventilator for more than a month, and some have endured invasive procedures to stay alive. Even if they recover physically, some Covid-19 survivors end up suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, due to time spent in the ICU, Davidson said. A study published in February found 30% of Covid-19 survivors experienced PTSD, which is a psychological illness that usually occurs after someone has a life-threatening experience. Negative effects were found in people infected in their third trimester of pregnancy, as well as their babies. Between March and September of last year, symptomatic pregnant people at one Israeli hospital had higher rates of gestational diabetes, a lower white blood cell count, and experienced heavier bleeding during their delivery. Their babies also experienced more breathing problems, a research team reported in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine. The study has limitations since it only looked at women in one hospital, so its findings may not be true for all people who are pregnant. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Then there is long Covid — when symptoms can last months after infection. A  large study published last month  showed more than one-third of Covid-19 patients suffered symptoms three to six months after getting infected. Some had multiple, long-lasting complications. Breathing problems, abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were among the most common issues reported. Accompanying data showed as many as 46% of children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 22 had experienced at least one symptom in the six months after recovering.   ‘Hit the reset button,’ top health official and evangelical Christian says A recent study by the Pew Research Center showed  White evangelical Protestants were among the least likely  adults to get vaccinated. The director of the National Institutes of Health — who identifies as an evangelical Christian — said it is time for that to change. “Christians, of all people, are supposed to be particularly worried about their neighbors,” Dr. Francis Collins told CNN on Saturday. He said those who are unvaccinated are more likely to get infected and spread the coronavirus to others. But for some reason, many evangelical Christians “have had a lot of trouble, in many instances, rolling up their sleeves,” Collins said. “Much of it is this disinformation that is so widely spread on the internet, and which has, I think, caused a lot of people to be confused or fearful about what the vaccinations might do to them,” Collins said. “And that is truly heartbreaking when we see, still, more than a thousand people losing their lives to this disease (daily), almost all of them unvaccinated, and therefore didn’t have to happen,” he said. “If you are a Christian, or if you’re anybody who has not yet gotten vaccinated, hit the reset button on whatever information you have that’s causing you to be doubtful or hesitant or fearful, and look at the evidence.”   Vaccines for kids under 5 may not come until next year For children under 5, Covid-19 vaccines may not be authorized until early next year, former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Sunday. The FDA is likely to ask for more data and perhaps for studies involving more children, because it is a new vaccine and a new virus, Gottlieb told CBS’s Face the Nation. “And that could push it into 2022. Previously we had talked about trying to have that data available before the end of this year, which could have prompted an authorization perhaps by the end of the year, at least in kids ages 2-4. I think that it’s more likely that it slips into the first quarter of next year at the very least, but not too far into next year,” said Gottlieb, who is also on Pfizer’s board. The FDA has called a meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), for October 26 to discuss pediatric vaccines. Pfizer has submitted data and a formal request for authorization for its one-third dose vaccine for use in children 5-11. But Gottlieb said he expects VRBPAC to also discuss what might be needed for authorization for the youngest children. Having more information to consider can raise public confidence in the vaccines, Gottlieb said. He is already confident and plans to vaccinate his own young daughters. “There’s a lot of parents like me that, as soon as the vaccines available for their children, are going to go out and get their kids vaccinated, that see the benefits of vaccination,” he said. “There’s a lot of parents who still have a lot of questions around vaccination. I think for them, they should have a conversation with their pediatrician to try to get comfortable with the idea of vaccinating kids.” Gottlieb said he thinks it will be years before the CDC recommends making Covid-19 vaccines part of the regular childhood vaccination schedule, which would open the door to school districts mandating them. “I think it’s a very long way off. Certainly CDC’s going to look at children ages 12-17 differently than 5-11,” he said.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday it has seen a 12% increase in reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,  or MIS-C , since late August. Doctors at a handful of children’s hospitals around the country say they are still treating more MIS-C cases than they had been earlier in the year, even though MIS-C is considered rare. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “We had a nice long break from those cases over the summer and even into the fall where we could get an occasional MIS-C case here and there, but in the last three or four weeks, there has definitely been an uptick. And I would anticipate that to continue through the next several weeks,” said Dr. Amy Edwards, an infectious disease specialist at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland. CDC said  it is aware of 5,217 cases reported through October 4. At least 46 children have died from MIS-C — a more than 12% increase in deaths from the month before and one of the largest increases this year. Overall, children are much less likely than adults to be hospitalized or to die from Covid-19.  More than 5.9 million children  have been diagnosed with Covid-19, but MIS-C cases make up a minute fraction — far less than 1%– of all cases identified among children. Doctors don’t know for sure what causes MIS-C. Often kids have Covid-19 first, but not always. For those few kids that do go on to develop MIS-C, the condition seems to inflame different parts of the body, and it can be serious. CDC advises  parents or caregivers to contact a doctor right away if a child has a fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes or extra tiredness. At Children’s National in DC, the uptick in cases just started last week, according to Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Pediatric Diseases. This wave of new MIS-C cases hasn’t been as big as two surges earlier in the year where they saw up to about 60 MIS-C patients. For this wave, they’ve had about 18 MIS-C patients so far. At Children’s Hospital Colorado, they too saw “significantly” more MIS-C cases in September, compared to previous months, according to Dr. Sam Dominguez, a pediatric disease expert at the hospital. But he said they aren’t seeing the same rates as they were seeing in December 2020 and January 2021. Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta also noted an increase in MIS-C cases in late September, about nine weeks after the area saw a spike in cases. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn During the past four weeks, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta has treated 58 children with MIS-C — nearly 20% of all the MIS-C cases they’ve treated so far — but Jennifer Burkhardt, a spokesperson for the hospital, said that MIS-C is still considered rare. It has occurred in less than 5% of the almost 7,400 children they’ve treated for Covid-19. Burkhardt said to prevent MIS-C and Covid-19, the hospital strongly recommends that everyone who is eligible get the vaccine. Georgia’s vaccination rate lags far behind the rest of the country. While more than 56% of the US population is fully vaccinated,  according to the CDC , only 48% of Georgia’s eligible population has been fully vaccinated and only 46% of Georgia’s teens have, according to the  Georgia Department of Health . The uptick in cases has not impacted the country evenly. Regions with smaller spikes in Covid-19 cases, such as Chicago, do not report an increase in MIS-C, according to Dr. Bill Muller, an infectious disease specialist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “We did see a surge of Covid-19 cases with Delta, including increased hospitalizations, but it wasn’t anywhere near what the South had,” Muller said. Doctors say that’s why vaccines are so important, even if the little children aren’t eligible to get a vaccine. The adults around them who can will help get the community’s case numbers down. If the number of Covid-19 cases are lower, there is a much smaller chance kids will develop MIS-C. The kids that seem most vulnerable to MIS-C seem to share similar demographic traits. Most reported MIS-C cases were among children and adolescents between 5 and 13, with an average age of about 9, CDC said. More than half, 59%, were in males. MIS-C has disproportionately affected children of color. In its latest update, CDC said 61% of reported cases are in children who are Latino or non-Hispanic Black. Edwards at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland said a lot of the kids they treat for MIS-C had mild or even asymptomatic coronavirus infections first. She said that’s something for parents to keep in mind. “Even if you’re not sure whether your kid had Covid, if they had mild symptoms after being exposed to somebody, but then they got better and then about a month later, they seem to be getting sick again, especially if they have a very high fever, I would err on the side of having them checked out sooner rather than later,” Edwards said. “What we know about MIS-C is the earlier you intervene, the less sick the kids seem to get.” DeBiasi at Children’s National said that they have had great success treating patients with MIS-C.  Treatment  includes fluids, respiratory support, anti-inflammatories and an  immunoglobulin infusion . “Even the sickest kids with MIS-C who are in the intensive care unit and need a lot of support, really seem to turn around relatively quickly once they get the anti-inflammatory treatment started quickly,” DeBiasi said.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by 0.16% to 3.73%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations dropped by eight to 745. Of those hospitalized, 550 remain in acute care and 188 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 545,028 total confirmed cases and 10,370 deaths. There are 3,938,200 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,097,873 doses. Of those, 3,993,650 are first doses with 1,291 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,631,999 second doses, 1,360 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 306,201 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 82 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 166,023 additional or booster vaccine doses, 2,400 in the last day. The state reported 84.6% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

(WJZ) —  The frustrations continued Monday for Southwest Airlines travelers stranded by cancellations at BWI and airports across the country. Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over the weekend and the Dallas-based airline accounted for nearly half of the flight cancellations worldwide Sunday. Another 363 flights were canceled Monday, leaving grounded flyers fed up. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The surge in cancellations upended people’s weekend plans, including those of Stan and Terri Dorsey, who were stranded in Baltimore while traveling from Pennsylvania to Portland, Maine. “Six hours we stood in line to get rebooked. Six hours with one gate agent rebooking hundreds of people,” said Terri Dorsey, adding that the couple boarded a flight at one point only to be told to get off. But it wasn’t a total loss, according to her husband, who joked that he was able to watch two football games just while standing in line. “It’s like, oh my goodness. We’re in Baltimore! We don’t know anybody here,” Stan Dorsey said. “What are we going to do?” The Dorseys weren’t alone. R.J. Morris’ family was traveling from Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, when they too were swept up by flight delays. “We were supposed to fly out yesterday after a weekend wedding and Southwest hit us up yesterday and just moved our flight to today,” Morris told WJZ. “We have some friends of ours who got their flights moved two days, and now we’re delayed again today.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Southwest has attributed to poor weather and air traffic control issues in Florida. “We experienced weather challenges in our Florida airports at the beginning of the weekend, challenges that were compounded by unexpected air traffic control issues in the same region, triggering delays and prompting significant cancellations for us beginning Friday evening,” the airline said in a statement, adding that it was doing everything in its power to make things right with customers. In a Sunday tweet, however, the Federal Aviation Administration pushed back against the airline’s explanation for canceled or delayed flights. “No FAA air traffic staffing shortages have been reported since Friday,” the tweet said. “Flight delays & cancellations occurred for a few hours Friday PM due to widespread severe weather, military training, & limited staffing in one area of the Jacksonville en route center. Some airlines continue to experience scheduling challenges due to aircraft and crews being out of place.” The Southwest Airline Pilots Association, the airline’s pilots union, last week asked a federal court to block the airline’s request that employees get vaccinated against COVID-19. According to CBS News, the  union has distanced its members from the delays and cancellations . “SWAPA is aware of operational difficulties affecting Southwest Airlines today due to a number of issues, but we can say with confidence that our pilots are not participating in any official or unofficial job actions,” the union said. Whatever the case, flyers like Stan Dorsey who have been stranded at airports across the country just want to go home.

https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/10/11/child-tax-credit-october-2021-when-stimulus-check/,,Child Tax Credit: When Will Your October Payment Arrive?,CBS Baltimore,CBS Baltimore,"The next advance Child Tax Credit payment goes out later this week, with direct deposits arriving almost immediately and mailed checks taking a little longer.","( CBS Detroit ) —  The fourth round of Child Tax Credit payments from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) goes out later this week. But parents are wondering when exactly the money will arrive. Last month’s check came on September 15 for those with direct deposit, or soon after for those dependent on the U.S. postal system. This month’s payment will be sent on October 15. Advance payments will continue next month and through the end of the year, thanks to the American Rescue Plan passed back in March. Though another round of stimulus checks seems to have been shelved, Democratic lawmakers are looking to extend the advance Child Tax Credit through 2025. Families can use the Child Tax Credit money however they like. That means the extra $250 or $300 per child can be put toward essentials like food or rent. It may also be spent on school supplies or a new computer, should COVID push students back into remote learning. Other households may apply the money toward piano lessons, daycare or even diapers. Regardless, the money comes at a time when much of the other pandemic aid —  most recently the extra unemployment insurance — has ended. Knowing that additional income is coming allows for a measure of security and flexibility in a world that’s full of surprises. How Much Should Your Check Be? READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The IRS is paying $3,600 total per child to parents of children up to five years of age. That drops to $3,000 for each child ages six through 17. Half of the total is being paid as six monthly payments and half as a 2021 tax credit. So each month through December parents of a younger child are receiving $300, and parents of an older child are receiving $250. The IRS has also made a one-time payment of $500 for dependents age 18 or full-time college students up through age 24.   Share information about the advance  #ChildTaxCredit  to help eligible families who are not required to file taxes register now to get monthly payments. See  #IRS  resources at  https://t.co/2G6i7dXm0z *Thanks Logan for helping us spread the word!*  pic.twitter.com/L95TXCQJfb   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 11, 2021 The updated Child Tax Credit is based on parents’ modified adjusted gross income (AGI), as reflected on their 2020 tax filing. (AGI is the sum of one’s wages, interest, dividends, alimony, retirement distributions and other sources of income minus certain deductions, such as student loan interest, alimony payments and retirement contributions.) The amount  phases out  at a rate of $50 for every $1,000 of annual income beyond $75,000 for an individual and beyond $150,000 for a married couple. The benefit is fully refundable, meaning it does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. Qualifying families receive the full amount, regardless of what they owe in taxes. There is no limit to the number of dependents that can be claimed. For example, suppose a married couple has a three-year-old child and a seven-year-old child and showed an annual joint income of $120,000 on their 2020 taxes. The IRS is sending them $550 per month. That’s $300 per month ($3,600 / 12) for the younger child and $250 per month ($3,000 / 12) for the older child. Those payments will last through December. The couple would then receive the $3,300 balance — $1,800 ($300 X 6) for the younger child and $1,500 ($250 X 6) for the older child — as part of their 2021 tax refund. Parents of a child who ages out of an age bracket are paid the lesser amount. That means if a five-year-old turns six in 2021, the parents will receive a total credit of $3,000 for the year, not $3,600. Likewise, if a 17-year-old turns 18 in 2021, the parents are receiving $500, not $3,000. An income increase in 2021 to an amount above the $75,000 ($150,000) threshold could lower a household’s Child Tax Credit. The IRS has confirmed that they’ll soon allow claimants to adjust their income and custodial information online, thus lowering their payments. Failure to do so could increase one’s tax bill or reduce one’s tax refund once 2021 taxes are filed. Eligibility requires that the dependent be a part of the household for at least half of the year and be at least half supported by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who makes above $95,000 ($170,000) — where the Credit phases out entirely — will not be eligible for the expanded credit. But they can still claim the existing $2,000 credit per child. How Do You Make Changes For Future Payments? The IRS has three different tools to help recipients and potential recipients update their information on file, register and check eligibility. Child Tax Credit Update Portal READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The  Child Tax Credit Update Portal  allows users to make sure they are registered to receive advance payments. It also lets recipients unenroll from advance payments in favor of a one-time credit when filing their 2021 taxes. The deadline for the next payment was October 4. (Subsequent opt-out deadlines for future payments will occur three days before the first Thursday of the month from which a person is opting out.) Here are the remaining opt-out deadlines:   Payment Date: November 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 1   Payment Date: December 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 29   The tool also allows users to add or modify bank account information for direct deposit, view their payment history, and update their mailing address. Other features coming to the portal include changing one’s income and dependents. To access this portal, users need an IRS username or an ID.me account. ID.me is a sign-in service used by various government agencies, including the IRS, Social Security Administration and Treasury Department, to authenticate users. Users need valid photo identification to create an account.   Some families may prefer to wait until the end of the year and receive the entire  #ChildTaxCredit  instead of receiving advance payments. An  #IRS  tool lets them do just that:  https://t.co/Qt9TAuwjvv   pic.twitter.com/OEok6WQhII   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 11, 2021 Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool The  Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool  is to help parents of children born before 2021 who don’t typically file taxes but qualify for advance Child Tax Credit payments. That means parents who have not filed their 2020 taxes, are not required to file, and don’t plan to file. (Parents who claimed their dependents on their 2019 tax return should not use this tool.) Users enter their personal information, including their name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, relevant social security numbers, bank account information, and identity protection PIN. The IRS uses the information to check eligibility and, once confirmed, will begin making payments. The IRS and experts advise using the tool on a desktop or laptop computer rather than a mobile device. Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant The  Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant  lets parents check if they are eligible to receive advance Child Tax Credit payments. Users will need a copy of their 2020 tax return or, barring that, their 2019 tax return.
