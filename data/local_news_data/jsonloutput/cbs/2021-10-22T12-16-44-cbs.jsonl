(WJZ) ‚Äî  An Annapolis woman accused of conspiring with her husband to sell military secrets to a foreign government must remain in custody while awaiting trial on espionage charges, a judge ruled Thursday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Trumble granted the government‚Äôs motion to detain Diana Toebbe, calling her a flight risk and national security threat if released. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School ‚ÄúAlthough Defendant has no prior criminal history, the nature and circumstances of the charges against her and her actions demonstrate that Defendant is a danger to every community and to our national security,‚Äù Trumble wrote. Toebbe, 45, and her husband, Jonathan, 42, were named Tuesday in a three-count indictment  charging the couple with one count of conspiracy to communicate restricted data and two counts of communication of restricted data . The couple is accused of  hatching a plot to sell classified data , which Toebbe‚Äôs husband allegedly stole from his workplace for the U.S. Navy‚Äôs nuclear program, to an unnamed foreign government in exchange for cryptocurrency. Authorities say Toebbe acted as a lookout for her husband when they crossed state lines several times to drop off batches of sensitive submarine data for someone they thought was a foreign agent but was in fact an undercover FBI agent. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The couple was arrested Oct. 9 in West Virginia, where they‚Äôve remained in custody while their case winds its way through the legal system. During a Wednesday detention hearing, Toebbe‚Äôs attorneys insisted their client was innocent and unaware of ‚Äúwhat her husband was up to.‚Äù They said Toebbe, a school teacher, was not a threat or flight risk and could be freed under special conditions. Prosecutors argued that she was complicit in the plot. They pointed to her presence at three of four ‚Äúdead drops,‚Äù and noted several messages the couple allegedly authored, in which they discussed plans to leave the country. In issuing his ruling, Trumble cited the government‚Äôs evidence, which included surveillances images, messages attributed to the couple and signals that they had the means and desire to escape. ‚ÄúDefense counsel presented no evidence or testimony but argued that electronic monitoring, a third-party custodian, and no computer or internet access would suffice to prevent Defendant from fleeing.

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The goal of the project, Earle told WJZ, was to make the path easier for people to negotiate. ‚ÄúI took (the project) up because it was something a little bit different,‚Äù Earle told WJZ.   Here‚Äôs what the trail looked like before and how it looks now.   Before the stairway was built, a stretch of the trail was muddy and the terrain wasn‚Äôt the easiest for people to use. ‚ÄúOnce I found that and the fact that there are actual students going through this messy, muddy hill, I decided, ‚ÄòWhy not improve it and make it a more accessible area for the community?'‚Äù Earle said. The troop cut pieces of lumber and assembled them into individual steps, then placed them along the path. Once that was complete, they filled in the steps with gravel.

His latest stop was here in Baltimore. During the  CNN town hall , moderated by Anderson Cooper, the president touched on several issues including infrastructure, his domestic agenda, his ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan, spending proposals, tax rates, supply chain issues and Covid during the 90-minute event. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School One of the first issues addressed was President Biden‚Äôs Build Back Better plan. Anderson Cooper:  ‚ÄúAre you close to a done deal?‚Äù President Joe Biden:  ‚ÄúThis is a big deal. We have two plans. One is the infrastructure plan, roads, highway, bridges, buses, trains, etc. And the other one is what I call the care economy. It has a lot of money in there for environmental remediation as well as care economy. For example, you know, we want to get the economy moving but millions of women can‚Äôt go to work because they don‚Äôt have any child care. That kind of thing. So there‚Äôs a lot of pieces in there. There‚Äôs a lot that people don‚Äôt understand. And by the way, all this paid for. Every single penny. It‚Äôs not going to raise one single cent.‚Äù President Biden also expressed optimism on two key spending proposals. He said he believes divided lawmakers are close to an agreement and urged to focus on compromising in regards to the legislation. Biden:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about compromise,‚Äù said Biden. ‚ÄúYou know, compromise has become a dirty word, but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible.‚Äù TAXES The president also said that corporations need to pay their fair share of taxes when asked about tax rates. Biden added that corporate leaders know they should be paying more in taxes. Ben Frederick, realtor : ‚ÄúI hear you repeatedly say that the wealthy are not paying their fair share of income taxes. What is the percentage of income that you believe is fair?‚Äù Biden:  ‚ÄúI come from the corporate state of the world: Delaware. More corporations in Delaware than every other state in the union combined. Okay? Now, here‚Äôs the deal, though. You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America making over $40 billion, don‚Äôt pay a cent. Not a single little red cent. Now, I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm a capitalist. I hope you can be a millionaire or billionaire. But at least pay your fair share. Chip in a little bit.‚Äù The corporate tax rate was 35 point, 37 percent. Barack and I thought it should come down. We thought it should come down to 28 percent. In the process, it came down to 21 percent under Trump. Which even the corporate leaders, and you know if you‚Äôre in real estate, major real estate, ask them. They know they should be paying a little more than 21 percent because the idea that if you‚Äôre a school teacher and a firefighter you‚Äôre paying at a higher tax rate than they are as a percentage of your taxes.‚Äù SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES When asked about the supply chain issues, President Biden said he is prepared to call the National Guard to help. Biden:  ‚ÄúThe answer is, ‚Äòyes,‚Äô if we can‚Äôt move, increase the number of truckers, which we are in a process of doing.‚Äù The president also addressed the increase in gas prices and said it‚Äôs likely that they will remain high until 2022. Biden:  ‚ÄúMy guess is you‚Äôll start to see gas prices come down as we get into next year, 2022. I don‚Äôt see anything that‚Äôs going to happen in the meantime that‚Äôs going to significantly reduce gas prices.‚Äù COVID The president was also asked what he would say to struggling Americans affected by COVID-19 and the economy. He said that as things improve within the country, spirits will be lifted. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Biden:  ‚ÄúA lot of it has to do with us getting back on our feet. Getting back on our feet, in terms of our attitudes about what the future looks like for us.‚Äù He also added,¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty of help. Being down, having some problem, in terms of needing some advice, if you have a broken spirit, it‚Äôs no different than a broken arm. They shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed of it. They should seek the help. There is a lot of people who can help.‚Äù The White House is gearing up to roll out COVID-19 shots for children ages five to 11 and the plans were released on  Wednesday.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre completing the operational planning to ensure vaccinations for kids ages five to 11 are available, easy and convenient,‚Äù White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be ready, pending the FDA and CDC decision.‚Äù Biden said his administration has ‚Äúsecured enough vaccine supply to vaccinate the 28 million children who would become eligible.‚Äù Biden:  ‚ÄúThe expectations are, they should be ready in the near term.‚Äù He also added, ‚ÄúI want to make it clear, unlike past administrations, science will dictate this.‚Äù Biden also addressed first responders who refuse to get vaccinated. He said he believes that they should ‚Äúbe forced to stay home or let go.‚Äù He also said he believes that mandates are working. Biden:  ‚ÄúI waited until July to talk about mandating. I tried everything else possible. The mandates are working.‚Äù FILLIBUSTER When asked about the filibuster, Biden said a debate over it right now will cost him votes on his economic agenda. Biden:  ‚ÄúHere is the deal, if, in fact, I get myself into at this moment the debate on the filibuster, I lose at least three votes right now to get what I have to get done on the economic side of the equation, foreign policy side of the equation.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIt used to be the filibuster the way it worked and we have ten times as many more than that, times the filibuster has been used since 1978, it used to be you had to stand on the floor and exhaust everything you had and when you gave up the floor and someone else sought the floor, they had to talk until they finished. You‚Äôre only allowed to do it a second time. After that, it‚Äôs over. You vote. Someone moves for the vote. I propose we bring that back now, immediately.‚Äù US SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS Biden said he has not visited the Southern Border but will consider it in the future. He said he has not had a ‚Äúwhole lot of time to visit.‚Äù Biden:  ‚ÄúI guess I should go down, but the whole point of it is I have not had a whole lot of time to get down.‚Äù The president also stressed that the US is not sending children back and defended his decision to uphold  Title 42. ‚ÄúWe have maintained that because of the continued extent of Covid in those countries from which people are coming. It is very, high. So, we maintained the policy.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWe are not sending back children, we send back adults, and we send back large families but we don‚Äôt send back children in that circumstance.‚Äù Get alerts from WJZ first!

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The rollout will not look like it did with adults‚Äîwith smaller vaccine clinics instead of mass vaccination sites. The doses will also be administered using smaller needles. Health officials will rely on trusted pediatricians, pharmacies and school clinics to get shots into arms. Dr. Tamar Mendelson, also with Johns Hopkins, said treating covid vaccinations like any normal visit to the doctor will reduce anxiety among children over the shot. On Thursday, a mobile vaccine clinic was set up outside Cherry Hill Elementary-Middle School where an outbreak hit last month. Three new cases have been reported in the last 10 days. The city‚Äôs public schools have reported 193 total infections in that same period. Janae Stanley has a daughter at the school. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frightening because this covid is killing people, and I care about my child‚Äôs safety,‚Äù she told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren. ‚ÄúMy sister is terrified.

Why do deliveries take so much longer than they used to? Why is everything more expensive? The short answer is  supply chain  issues. The long answer is not that simple. It goes without saying that the once-in-a-lifetime COVID pandemic has exacerbated existing issues. That includes a shortage of workers along the path that products take from the factory to a consumer‚Äôs doorstep, creating multiple bottlenecks in a system that depends on timeliness to function, just as demand has drastically increased for those products. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Even that more complicated explanation doesn‚Äôt fully explain why consumers can‚Äôt buy what they want when they want. That‚Äôs because there are no easy answers and no easy fixes. What Is The Supply Chain? The supply chain is the series of steps that brings a product to a customer.  Martin Dresner , Professor and Chair of the Logistics, Business and Public Policy Department at the R.H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, describes it as the¬†‚Äúnetwork of manufacturers, their suppliers, distributors, retailers that are responsible for getting products from point of origin to the final customer.‚Äù The network for any given company can start with suppliers of raw materials and other inputs, and include shipping those supplies to a manufacturing facility. Once inputs are transformed into a finished product, it is moved to a warehouse or a store and then ultimately to the final customer. Various agents, brokers, vendors, transportation companies, and distribution centers can play key roles along the way in ensuring a product gets made and reaches its final destination. A supply chain for large company can get very complicated very fast. Dresner describes just how complicated in an example of a typical packaged goods company: ‚ÄúA packaged goods manufacturer has many suppliers, and those suppliers will be supplying raw materials for use in the production process. And that could be farmers, or farmers can sell through distributors. Or the product used by the manufacturer might be manufactured themselves, so they may have other components suppliers. ‚ÄúWe think of the suppliers that sell directly to Procter & Gamble or Kellogg‚Äôs as first-tier suppliers,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúBut then there are people who supply them, and we would call those second-tier suppliers. And there could be third-tier, fourth-tier suppliers as well, all the way back to where the components of the product originate. That manufacturer also may not do all the manufacturing themselves. They contract out some manufacturing. Those contract manufacturers are also suppliers to packaged good manufacturers. And they have their own supply chains.‚Äù Once a product is produced, it must find its way to the consumer. ‚ÄúManufacturers will often not sell directly to customers, but they will sell through distributors,‚Äù Dresner further explains. ‚ÄúDistributors may sell to retailers, and manufacturers may sell directly to retailers. There can be other companies involved in the sale and distributions of products. There can be agents or brokers, transporters. There are all sorts of companies that need to be involved in getting the product to their eventual end user. All these companies, they‚Äôre a part of that focal firm, that packaged goods manufacturer‚Äôs supply chain.‚Äù So many steps along the way leave plenty of opportunities for slowdowns. And those slowdowns build upon each other to create growing delays for a company. Multiple Elements Are Making Matters Worse Now imagine that every company that produces and/or sells a physical product has its own unique supply chain. Some are more complicated, some are less complicated. But all of them have some basic elements in common. And all leverage the same regional, national and global systems to (hopefully) deliver their product to their consumer in a timely manner. This broader global pipeline of goods is the ‚Äúsupply chain‚Äù that‚Äôs garnering headlines for all the causing delays and pushing up prices. Cargo ships carrying as many as half a million  shipping containers  filled with goods from various countries in Asia await offloading at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Once they are offloaded, a  shortage of truck drivers  prevents those loads from moving out of ports in a timely manner.  Railroad terminals , where trucks deliver goods for the next leg of the journey, are backed up with containers awaiting further transport, which, in turn, also block inbound trains. Should those goods somehow make it to a warehouse, worker shortages are limiting their timely processing. And, as if all that weren‚Äôt enough, the  United States Postal Service  has recently slowed its delivery times. The ¬†COVID pandemic is certainly to blame for this cascading array of problems in the supply chain. But it isn‚Äôt the only culprit. A global microchip shortage, exacerbated by  Texas winter storms  that affected domestic production, is slowing the production of cars and various electronic devices. China, where many consumer goods destined for America are produced, is suffering through an  ongoing energy crisis  that‚Äôs curtailing manufacturing. And manufacturers in many other countries with lower rates of vaccination have endured shutdowns and worker shortages brought on by the spread of the Delta variant. One Small Company Suffering Big Supply Chain Problems The  Unemployed Philosophers Guild  (UPG) is one of the many companies navigating the supply chain issues affecting the entire marketplace. The Brooklyn-based gift company specializes in creating and selling smart and funny gifts for smart and funny people or, as their website puts it,¬†‚Äúfulfilling the people‚Äôs needs for finger puppets, warm slippers, coffee cups, and cracking up at stuff.‚Äù READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Finger puppets of famous people, known as  magnetic personalities , are among its most popular gifts, according to UPG Director of Sales, Trudi Bartow. Current bestsellers include former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, former painter and television host Bob Ross, and President Biden‚Äôs Chief Medical Advisor, Anthony Fauci. ‚ÄúWe partner with the manufacturer to physically make that product,‚Äù according to Bartow. ‚ÄúI would say that 65 percent of our products are made overseas, which is a little bit different than if they‚Äôre made in the United States. Supply chain issues for the most part right now are overseas issues, so I‚Äôll focus on that. Once our manufacturer has made the product, then we load it onto a container, load that container onto a boat. We ship that boat to the U.S. It goes to a port. It gets taken off the boat. The container is put on a rail. The rail goes into our warehouse. Our warehouse takes the container and puts it all on the shelf and marks it all as in stock. And then we sell it to physical stores or to online stores, doesn‚Äôt really matter. And that product is then taken out of the warehouse, put on a truck, shipped to the store, and then put on that store‚Äôs shelves, either physically, so someone can walk in and remove it and purchase it, or in some online store purchase it and then it is shipped to them.‚Äù Those finger puppets, like many of UPG‚Äôs other products and goods across the marketplace in general, are taking longer to get to market. ‚ÄúWe are not unique, as is any gift manufacturer or any manufacturer of any product,‚Äù says Bartow. ‚ÄúThere are pretty much issues throughout the entire process, throughout the entire supply chain‚Ä¶ There really are problems everywhere.‚Äù Where Are The Problems? The United States is the world‚Äôs largest economy, with the purchases of individual consumers accounting for over two-thirds of the economic activity. Some of those purchases are services, like dry-cleaning or a stay at a fancy hotel. Some of those purchases are goods, which could be anything from an Anthony Fauci finger puppet to a $45,000 SUV. Around  90 percent  of goods produced travel across an ocean to reach a consumer. For a magnetic finger puppet, destined to be displayed on your neighbor‚Äôs refrigerator, that trip begins at a manufacturing plant in China alongside thousands of other little finger puppets. And that manufacturing plant is likely experiencing problems. According to Bartow, ‚Äúit can start at the factory overseas, rising costs of goods, an increase in electric fees on the Chinese power grid particularly, COVID cases shutting down warehouses, while they do cleanings. Keeping distance on the manufacturing floor has created delays there.‚Äù Once that little Anthony Fauci is created, it must find its way to a port, where a boat can take it across the Pacific Ocean. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs physically a lack of drivers everywhere, so getting containers to ports is tricky, because now there‚Äôs a backlog,‚Äù Bartow explains. ‚ÄúThen things are sitting on ports for extra long time, because there‚Äôs delays in seafarers and boats. So now instead of sitting there for a week or two, you could sit there for multiple weeks waiting to even get a booking. And once you get a booking, there‚Äôs even more delays with dock workers getting your stuff onto boats.‚Äù The time for that Anthony Fauci finger puppet to cross the ocean hasn‚Äôt changed. But the time for him to transfer to the next leg of the trip has. ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôve arrived at, say, the Port of LA,‚Äù Bartow continues. ‚ÄúAnd instead of taking a week to clear and get off, it could be two, three weeks maybe even more, because there‚Äôs a long queue in the Port of LA. Once again these are all restrictions on the supply chain. There‚Äôs not enough dock workers. The dock workers that are there are under safety restrictions. There are shutdowns for COVID. There‚Äôs increased or decreased hours depending on labor. So that adds delay.‚Äù Eventually the Anthony Fauci finger puppet and all his finger puppet friends find their way into the Port of Los Angeles and off the boat. But the delays continue. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a  shortage of drivers . There‚Äôs a shortage of trucks. There‚Äôs a shortage of physical containers to move things back and forth.‚Äù After a long road trip from the port, the finger puppets arrive at the warehouse. ‚ÄúThe warehouse is subject to the same hurdles as everywhere else,‚Äù Bartow points out. ‚ÄúThe shortage of labor causing a shortage in packing containers. Containers can sit outside a warehouse for one to three weeks.‚Äù But the trip still isn‚Äôt over. When an online or physical retailer places an order for 100 Anthony Fauci magnetic personalities, a box is sent to the store. Once there, a customer can buy the finger puppet in person or online. At that point, the U.S. mail system takes over. The  U.S. Postal Service  has started slowing deliveries in an effort to cut costs. The inevitable result for the consumers will be more delays in the last leg of that finger puppet‚Äôs journey. With problems all along the supply chain, consumers are experiencing increasing shortages, higher prices, and delivery showdowns for a wide range of goods across the economy. That could mean wine from northern California, as producers try to  procure bottles  and the paper for labels. That could also mean food items at the local  grocery store , as retailers struggle to stock shelves. It could even mean  artificial Christmas trees  and decorations, which are currently stuck in ports around the country. All the supply chain issues don‚Äôt bode well for the upcoming holiday season. Expect extensive delays as potential gifts, move slowly across oceans, through ports, along highways and railroad tracks to warehouses and stores. So if you‚Äôre expecting to give an Anthony Fauci finger puppet to remind friends and loved ones to wear a mask, ordering early is probably a good idea.

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School MW-  Adhir, Parker nice to see you both again. Second season of  United States Of Al  underway, congratulations right off the bat. How does it feel to be back for season two? AK-  Oh gosh, I mean what a thrill this is. The fact that we get to come back and shoot a second season was just a real treat, we feel lucky. MW-  What were some of the big differences in shooting season two compared to season one? AK-  Well, I think with the second season the biggest difference has been that we had to address what was happening in Afghanistan. When the writers came together to begin writing season two none of what happened was unfolding. As Kabul fell into the hands of the Taliban and we began to see the United States withdrawing from Afghanistan our writers had no choice but to scrap what we had and go back to the writer‚Äôs room. PY-  Yeah, I think this scenario unfolding was something that we were somewhat aware of and then the worst case scenario really unfolded. No one anticipated it unfolding as quickly as it did. AK-  We had already begun shooting season two and we had an entirely different premiere episode and we had to pivot. We had to adjust and address what had happened. We didn‚Äôt know what that story was or what the new premier would be or even what the season was going to look like moving forward. PY-  What we did know was that we had to help our Afghan colleagues get their loved ones out of Afghanistan, or at least do everything in our power to assist them in that in that process. So we literally put everything on hold and we were on the phone for days on end trying to get ahold of loved ones. We were essentially conducting a rescue operation and through that rescue operation the premiere episode really revealed itself. Our art really imitated life. AK-  I think you know the opening episode of the season was incredibly strong. We certainly feel like it was authentic because it was. It was a reflection of the real-life experiences people were facing. Everyone really banded together to not only serve the story but to also be a source of support for real people. We will continue to track the stories of these characters against the backdrop of everything that‚Äôs unfolding as the season progresses. We will also begin to see these characters truly develop their relationships. I think the outline gets even stronger as the season evolves. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall We‚Äôll get to learn more about Riley‚Äôs readjustment to civilian life and the steps that he‚Äôs taking to get himself into a better headspace. We‚Äôll learn more about how his family and we have some really, really funny episodes on the way. I think our writers and Mr. Chuck Lorre have done a remarkable job of really trying to shed a spotlight on some very serious issues but doing so in a heartfelt sincere way, in a way that‚Äôs also quite touching. PY-  Yeah, it was obviously incredibly emotional for everyone. Everything felt so heightened at the time because it was. What we will endeavor to do on the show is to tell stories as truthful and as honest as possible whilst at the same time keeping audiences entertained. This is ultimately a family show and you know we really want the show to reflect not only the lives of these characters but to offer something for everyone. MW-  Sounds like you went through a very real-life situation while making this season. How much work goes into making the show as authentic as possible with feedback from people you have behind the scenes? AK-  How lucky are we that we have such a wealth of experience and insight to be able to draw upon. Whether it‚Äôs our truth, or Afghan colleagues or veterans on staff or we have an incredible military consultant as well. They really are able to bring their own life experiences to the show. I think certainly from the responses we‚Äôve gotten from the Afghan community and the military, they really feel that there‚Äôs a degree of authenticity that the show is bringing to the table. PY-  Absolutely, yeah these are true stories. I think that everybody is really endeavoring to make the show as great as possible, to honor our veterans. We‚Äôre taking this very serious subject matter but we‚Äôre making it fun and palatable and hope that everybody enjoys it as much as we‚Äôre enjoying making it. AK-  It‚Äôs such a great privilege that we have been working with such an amazing team of writers and producers and Mr. Chuck Lorre. They are all so incredibly adept at taking things that might not look like there are going to be funny when you look at them on a page but they just make things really heartfelt. We just hope these stories will continue to resonate with viewers MW-  Absolutely, thank you both so much for the time and all the best moving forward! AK-  Thanks, Matt! PY-  Thank you, man.

Also playing at All-Star weekend: the men‚Äôs teams from Howard and Morgan State. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The NBA plans to generate exposure for historically Black colleges and universities at the All-Star weekend again this season, announcing Thursday the matchup for the inaugural NBA HBCU Classic on Feb. 19. Howard was scheduled to play Morgan State that day at home in Washington; instead, at the NBA‚Äôs request, the teams will meet in Cleveland on the Saturday of All-Star weekend. Howard athletic director Kery Davis wasn‚Äôt sure how his basketball coach, Kenny Blakeney, would like the idea of giving up a home Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference game against a rival. Turns out, Blakeney didn‚Äôt need any convincing. ‚ÄúThis is great for everybody,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúA rising tide lifts all boats and this is a great opportunity for all HBCUs and for us individually in terms of exposing people to our university and our university‚Äôs history, traditions and excellence, quite frankly. So, he got it right away.‚Äù Some details are still being worked out. The NBA said the game will be nationally televised from the Wolstein Center in Cleveland, the arena that will play host to some All-Star weekend events. The home of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, will be the site of the biggest events of the weekend, such as All-Star Saturday Night and the All-Star Game itself on Sunday. There are no shortage of NBA players who have worked to raise the exposure of HBCUs in recent years, James, Curry and Chris Paul among them. The league said at All-Star weekend last season that it would do its part as well. On Thursday, in addition to announcing plans for the game, it revealed the start of a paid fellowship program that will place HBCU students in jobs with the league office and with NBA and WNBA teams. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúThe NBA should be commended for the foresight and willingness to address important issues surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion,‚Äù Morgan State athletic director and vice president Ed Scott said. Last season‚Äôs All-Star Game in Atlanta generated at least $3 million for HBCUs ¬†through donations to scholarship funds ‚Äî and the exposure those schools got during the game was worth even more. The court was designed by artists from HBCUs; the pregame featured bands from Grambling State, Florida A&M and Clark Atlanta; and¬† even the trio of referees assigned to the game ¬†by the NBA were all HBCU graduates. Howard‚Äôs history is rich, with the school dating back to 1867 and a list of alumni that includes Vice President Kamala Harris, Elijah Cummings, Thurgood Marshall, Toni Morrison and countless other people prominent in their fields. But when Davis travels the country, he said, he‚Äôs routinely asked where Howard is and if it‚Äôs a Division I institution. After All-Star weekend, he hopes, more people will know the answer to those questions. ‚ÄúI think it gives us an opportunity to connect with an audience who potentially don‚Äôt know much about us,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúBut also, not only does it give an opportunity to get exposure to the universities, it also gives an opportunity to tell the story of the universities ‚Äî which is even more important.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized (¬© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

The disease also puts their children at risk. The first study showed that pregnant women with symptomatic Covid-19 had a higher percentage of emergency complications when compared to those who tested positive but didn‚Äôt have symptoms. This research was part of a presentation given to the Anesthesiology 2021 Annual meeting over the weekend. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Of the 100 Covid-positive mothers who delivered babies between March and September of last year at one hospital in Texas, 58% of those with symptomatic infections delivered in emergency circumstances, the study, which has yet to be peer reviewed, found. For those with an asymptomatic case, 46% did. The mothers with symptoms were more likely have emergency complications that were a danger to the baby. More babies were born breech, there was more likely to be decreased fetal movement, and some had too little amniotic fluid. The study also found that babies born to these symptomatic mothers were much more likely to need oxygen support and more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Plus, babies born to these symptomatic mothers were much more likely to need oxygen support and more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. ‚ÄúCOVID-19 has severe systemic effects on the body, especially symptomatic patients,‚Äù said Kristine Lane, a medical student at the University of Texas Medical Branch, in Galveston, Texas, who helped lead the study. ‚ÄúIt is possible that these effects are amplified in pregnant mothers, who have increased fetal and maternal oxygen demands.‚Äù There‚Äôs also a possibility, she said, that the doctors caring for the symptomatic patients were being cautious because of the virus and proactively recommend a cesarean delivery. Dr. Gil Mor, a reproductive immunologist who did not work on the study but reviewed the work, said it‚Äôs also possible that the problems could be related to chronic inflammation caused by Covid-19. ‚ÄúInflammation is extremely dangerous for both the mother and the development of the fetus. A chronic inflammation is now a fight for the survival of the mother and the fetus, and in every fight, they pay they pay a price,‚Äù said Mor, who leads a research lab at Wayne State University that studies the immune system during pregnancy and the impact of pathogens. ‚ÄúWe need to do everything in our hands in order to prevent the chronic inflammation.‚Äù The  other study  was peer reviewed and was published Sunday in The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine. This research looked at the impact Covid-19 had on women in the third trimester of their pregnancies. Scientists looked at the records for more than 2,400 women at one hospital in Israel between March and September of last year and saw significant health differences between the women who had Covid-19 and those who did not. Of the Covid-19 positive patients, 67% were asymptomatic. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The women who had symptomatic Covid-19 had the most trouble, Dr. Elior Eliasi of the Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center and colleagues found. They had higher rates of gestational diabetes, a lower white blood cell count, and experienced heavier bleeding during their delivery. Their babies also experienced more breathing problems. The increased risk of problems was nearly 20% higher for women who had Covid-19 symptoms, and 14% higher for people with asymptomatic Covid-19. Unlike the other research, this study did not find symptomatic women were significantly more likely to deliver early. The study has limitations as it only looked at women in one hospital, so its findings may not be true for all people who are pregnant. These new studies add to a growing body of evidence that Covid-19, particularly symptomatic Covid-19, is a real threat to people who are pregnant and provides more evidence that the risks of Covid-19 far outweigh the risks to pregnant women of getting vaccinated, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, who did not work on this study. Only a third of people who are pregnant are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Vaccines can protect pregnant women from getting Covid-19 and if they have a breakthrough case, a vaccinated person is much more likely to have mild symptoms, if any at all. The protection that comes from a vaccine is also passed along to the newborn. ‚ÄúThese studies fit into an overall emerging pattern of what we have seen with other research,‚Äù said Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at the Emory University School of Medicine and a member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology‚Äôs Covid-19 expert group. ‚ÄúCovid impacts pregnancies and can cause severe illness in pregnant persons and their babies, this is clear.‚Äù Jamieson said it is important for doctors to urge their pregnant patients to get the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Initially the CDC guidance said that women could get the vaccine but it did not recommend it. That‚Äôs because the initial vaccine studies did not intentionally include pregnant women, although there were woman who became pregnant during the studies. After more research, the CDC sent out an  urgent plea  in September that strongly recommended pregnant women get vaccinated right away. ‚ÄúI know pregnant persons can be reluctant to take medications or receive vaccines during their pregnancy and they really want to do everything possible to protect their baby, and they make sacrifices in pregnancies, but I think it has to be balanced with the risks of not getting vaccinated,‚Äù Jamieson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important for all persons to get vaccinated, but in particular for pregnant persons to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and to protect their babies.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized The-CNN-Wire  ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

West Virginia has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, with 1 in 5 children living in poverty, according to  2019 data compiled by the USDA . County-level secession movements are not a novel idea. In fact, those three Maryland counties were named in a previous secessionist effort nearly a decade ago. As WTOP reports, a grassroots secessionist group rallied support for an unsuccessful plan that would have seen  Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett and Washington counties leave Maryland to form a new state , which would‚Äôve been dubbed Western Maryland. Rural counties in Oregon  have pitched the idea  of becoming part of Idaho, and a group of counties in Colorado  wants to join up  with Wyoming.

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 20 to 765. Of those hospitalized, 561 remain in acute care and 195 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 545,439 total confirmed cases and 10,397 deaths. There are 3,938,200 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,108,425 doses. Of those, 3,996,427 are first doses with 2,777 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,634,316 second doses, 2,317 in the last day. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 306,378 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 177 in the last day. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 171,304 additional or booster vaccine doses, 5,281 in the last day. The state reported 84.6% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

The two also talk about paying homage to Batman and what it‚Äôs like to work on the show READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School KJ ‚Äî Joining me today to talk all about the action-packed upcoming season, Batwoman herself, Javicia Leslie, and a strong woman off-screen, but who plays a powerful business mogul in the series, Robin Givens. Thank you so much for hanging out with me today! Robin, starting with your new character ‚ÄòJada Jet,‚Äô what do you love about her? And what can fans expect to see from her contributions to the season? RG ‚Äî I‚Äôm in love with her. I just absolutely love her. She is so powerful, like you mentioned. She runs a major company in Gotham City. The fact that Robin, I get to be a part of Gotham City is really fantastic. I love trying to bring her to life in a special way in the sense that she is a powerful woman, but she‚Äôs basically just a mom also. Her Achilles heel, if she has one, would be her children ‚Äî her two children. Ryan hasn‚Äôt grown up with her mom in her life, which was a major cliff-hanger in the last season. I‚Äôm not sure Jada is really ready to have a relationship with Ryan. But we see a lot of guilt there; we see a lot of love there. We see‚Äîat first‚Äîkeeping her at bay. The dynamic of their relationship is a special one. She‚Äôs willing to do anything to protect her children and I mean anything. KJ ‚Äî You mention how exciting it was to be a part of the Gotham world. Were you guys both DC Comics fans growing up? Were you a fan of Batwoman? JL ‚Äî I was a huge, huge Batman fan‚Äîlike‚Äîexcessively huge Batman fan. So enter the world of Batwoman in this kind of way and‚Äîespecially Season 3‚Äîbe able to play homage to Batman through having the Batman Villain Trophies in Gotham and those trophies influencing new villains. So you‚Äôre talking about villains influenced by the Mad Hatter, Killer Croc, and by Victor Fries. To be a part of that storytelling is so much fun. I literally feel like a child just doing this imaginary make-believe world, but influenced obviously by a make-believe world I grew up watching and creating in my mind. KJ ‚Äî What about you, Robin? RG ‚Äî We get to live in it. We get to live in this world. Sometimes we‚Äôre doing a scene and you‚Äôre saying these words and you‚Äôre inside this world and it‚Äôs just really cool. It‚Äôs so much fun to be able to experience it from inside Gotham City. KJ ‚Äî I do want to ask you, Robin, stepping into this character, who is a new character this season. What has the chemistry been like on set for you? How would you describe your relationship with cast and crew? RG ‚Äî I am happy, Katie, that you asked that question. It‚Äôs so‚Äîokay, Javicia. Turn your ears off. I know you‚Äôre tired of hearing it. For a second. She has such a major role. She‚Äôs Batwoman, she‚Äôs the leader on screen, but she‚Äôs also the leader off-screen. Whatever the chemistry is on set, it‚Äôs so magnificent. We laugh so much. To be able to go to work, and we all know this, to want to go to work and to have fun. Sometimes in scenes we‚Äôre crying. The other day we were doing this major scene and Javicia made me break and I‚Äôm cracking up with tears rolling down my eyes. It is just such a pleasure, and I think so much of that comes from her. We have Caroline Dries who is our show runner and writer‚Äîruns this amazing team, gives us these fantastic words. The chemistry is fantastic. Right now I just don‚Äôt want it to end. KJ ‚Äî I remember watching an interview with you, Javicia, when you first joined this role, how you felt like it was a family, and you‚Äôve never been more welcomed than this role. That seems still true today. JL ‚Äî Yes, yes! And it‚Äôs so cool to get new members of our family joining. You guys have all been amazing additions to this family. We all have so much fun together that even when we do Zoom press calls and we‚Äôre all there, we‚Äôre constantly cracking jokes and remembering thing that happened. It‚Äôs a really positive energy and a positive vibe. It does make coming to work fun, but it also makes coming to work easy. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall KJ ‚Äî Javicia, with the introduction of your character last season, what does it mean to you to come back to this show this season and continue the legacy of Batwoman? JL ‚Äî It‚Äôs amazing! It‚Äôs fun! This is the show‚Äôs third season, but my second season. They‚Äôre all like, ‚ÄòOkay, we‚Äôre doing this again.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like‚Äîahh we‚Äôre doing this again! This is really cool, this is really fun, this is really epic. I‚Äôm just so excited about this season. This season is so much fun. Like I said earlier, every episode could stand alone. They‚Äôre full and they‚Äôre colorful and they‚Äôre Gotham, so they‚Äôre dark and creepy. It‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôll see little snippets of movies and it will be a really gory scene of someone‚Äôs face getting cut off and I‚Äôll be like‚Äî‚Äôwe did that first.‚Äô I‚Äôm proud! We did that creepy thing first. Just to be a part of a show that is so groundbreaking and everyone that is a part of it is so committed to the story and so committed to every element of the story‚Äîit just makes it so much fun. KJ ‚Äî You definitely get a sense of that when I watched a preview for this season and scenes from episodes that haven‚Äôt been released yet. It‚Äôs just incredible the connection you guys have on set and everything you‚Äôve been able to do with the show. Is there anything else I haven‚Äôt asked you about the upcoming season that you want to include? JL ‚Äî I know I‚Äôm really excited for the villains. That‚Äôs one of my favorite things because, when it comes to anything that has to do with Batman, I love the villains. I‚Äôve actually loved the villains more than anything. And then I‚Äôm really excited for this journey Ryan is going on with her mom. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going to happen. Robin knows this about me. I can only read the episode that is the episode coming up. I can‚Äôt read any further than that because then I start getting confused and making character decisions that aren‚Äôt even applying to this episode. So they all may know what‚Äôs happening in episode 9 and I only know what‚Äôs happening in this current episode that I‚Äôm on. I have no idea what‚Äôs going to happen with Ryan and Jada. Then, to top it off, we did a scene the other day and Jada did some real crazy thing. I‚Äôm looking at whatever happened, and I come back and I look at Jada and I think to myself‚ÄîI think this as Javicia and I think Ryan thought this too‚Äî‚ÄôDo I really want to be a part of this family? They are crazy! RG ‚Äî Katie! You should‚Äôve seen it. She turns back around and goes‚Äî‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know!‚Äô KJ ‚Äî I love that you‚Äôve been able to incorporate that! RG ‚Äî She‚Äôs willing to do anything and I mean anything! But, Javicia‚Äîjust so you know‚Äîwe have some other history that‚Äôs going to be made when you speak of villains in a way. We can‚Äôt give it away, don‚Äôt you give it away! JL ‚Äî I know I‚Äôm bad about that. RG ‚Äî I think the world will be really excited to see. JL ‚Äî I give a lot of‚Äîwhat are they called?

On the night of November 26, 2019, Sopp, who suffered from mental health issues, took off after threatening to kill himself with an ice pick but left the pick at home, his family said at the time. Catherine Sopp called police and warned a dispatcher he was driving drunk and suicidal. ‚ÄúThere needs to be someone out there looking for his car before he hurts himself,‚Äù she told a dispatcher according to audio of the 911 call released by police.

The pilots union accused the company of a botched response to what it said would have been a minor challenge for other airlines.       The third straight day of canceled and delayed flights left passengers stranded and steaming from California to the East Coast.   ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt really relax when you‚Äôre just sitting there waiting for your next flight to be canceled,‚Äù said Vanessa Wheeler, who was biding her time at the San Jose, California, airport. She said Southwest canceled six consecutive flights on her over three days before she eventually decided to book a flight home to Las Vegas with Delta Air Lines. She vowed to never fly Southwest again.   Monday‚Äôs cancellations amounted to 10% of Southwest‚Äôs schedule, and at least 1,400 other flights, or roughly 40%, were delayed, according to the FlightAware tracking service. Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. fell 4.2%.   The widespread disruptions began shortly after the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, representing 9,000 pilots, asked a federal court on Friday to block the airline‚Äôs order that all employees get vaccinated. The union argued that Southwest must negotiate over the issue because it could involve sick leave or disability if pilots have a reaction to the vaccine.     If your travel was affected, please explore self-service rebooking options by checking your flight status on  https://t.co/GiF91yLJcx . (2/2)   ‚Äî Southwest Airlines (@SouthwestAir)  October 9, 2021     ¬†   ‚ÄúWe are not anti-vaccination at all, but our pilots are extremely worried about how their medicals are going to be handled‚Äù if they are unable to fly, union president Casey Murray told The Associated Press. Murray said pilots had not staged a sickout because of the vaccine mandate.   He instead blamed the chaos of the past few days on Southwest‚Äôs operation, which he said has become ‚Äúbrittle‚Äù and ‚Äúcracks under the slightest pressure.‚Äù He said the airline uses antiquated crew-scheduling technology that leads to cascading disruptions when flights are canceled in one part of its network.   Unions at both Southwest and American have also argued that management has been too slow to bring pilots back from leaves of absence that the airlines persuaded them to take during the pandemic, leaving them short-handed.   In a video for employees, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said that despite ‚Äúa very aggressive hiring plan ‚Ä¶ we are still not where we want to be with staffing,‚Äù especially pilots.   The staffing shortage is leading to fewer flights. After massive delays this summer, Southwest trimmed its fall schedule, which Van de Ven said had helped reduce delays in the past month. He said Southwest has already made significant cuts in its original schedules for November and December, ‚Äúand if we think we need to do more, we will.‚Äù   There is a risk to fewer flights, however: It leaves Southwest with fewer options to accommodate stranded passengers.   Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration acknowledged delays in part of Florida on Friday but pushed back against Southwest‚Äôs air-traffic control explanation. The FAA said Sunday that ‚Äúsome airlines‚Äù were experiencing problems because of planes and crews being out of position. Southwest was the only airline to report such a large percentage of canceled and delayed flights over the weekend.   Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said there was no evidence that would indicate the disruptions were caused by any sort of employee protest over vaccinations.   Some passengers were frustrated not just by flight delays but also the lack of a clear reason for them.   ‚ÄúMy concern is we had no explanation really that was, I feel, very legitimate or believable,‚Äù said Brian Gesch of Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, who was traveling through Reagan Washington National Airport with his wife. He doubted that weather and air traffic controllers were the real issue. ‚ÄúSo we are frustrated and missing a day of work.‚Äù   Others were just concerned about getting home ‚Äî any way they could.   Kent Moddelmog ended up driving 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) with his 14-year-old son from Phoenix to Dublin, California, after Southwest canceled their flight and he couldn‚Äôt find a flight on a competing airline that wasn‚Äôt exorbitantly priced. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to drop $3,000 to get back,‚Äù Moddelmog said.   The sales director for a consulting company said he flies Southwest dozens of times a year but had ‚Äúnever been in a situation like that.‚Äù   Savanthi Syth, an airlines analyst for Raymond James, said the weekend problems will increase Southwest‚Äôs costs and worsen the company‚Äôs strained relations with unions.   Southwest has¬† struggled all summer ¬†with high numbers of delayed and canceled flights. In August, it announced it was trimming its September schedule by 27 flights a day, or less than 1%, and 162 flights a day, or 4.5% of the schedule, from early October through Nov. 5.   The White House has pushed airlines to adopt vaccine mandates because they are federal contractors ‚Äî they get paid by the Defense Department to operate flights, including those that carried Afghanistan refugees to the U.S. this summer.   United Airlines was the first major U.S. carrier to announce a vaccination requirement. Southwest had remained silent even after President Joe Biden announced his order for federal contractors and large employers. Finally last week, Southwest told employees they must be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8 to keep their jobs. Workers can ask to skip the shots for medical or religious reasons.                                     ", "sentiment": -0.008857560568086877, "subjectivity": 0.3622096908939014, "wordcount": 907}

(WJZ) ‚Äî  There‚Äôs no question that bus drivers play a key role in every school district. They make sure students make it to school on time and back home safely after the bell rings. It‚Äôs for those reasons that Anne Arundel County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. George Arlotto came up with a  $7.4 million plan to raise pay for all its school bus drivers and attendants by $5 an hour .

It couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time ‚Äì  drivers with one bus company went on strike last week , calling for higher wages to match a more demanding workload brought about by a nationwide shortage. The need isn‚Äôt lost on parents, like Patrick Broadbent, whose daughter attends an Anne Arundel County elementary school. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an essential job, bus drivers, and I think it‚Äôs something they need to get compensated for,‚Äù he said. Broadbent acknowledged that ferrying around other people‚Äôs children isn‚Äôt something he‚Äôs cut out for. That‚Äôs why he recognizes how important it is to hire and retain school bus drivers. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a (Commercial Driver‚Äôs License), would you rather drive a truck for Pepsi or Coke or something, or would you rather drive around a bunch of kids?‚Äù he wondered aloud.

This year, he said, has been different. ‚ÄúHer kindergarten year she had the same bus driver every day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis year it fluctuates like she‚Äôll have one bus driver for one week and then a different bus driver.‚Äù Melissa Ellis, president of the Anne Arundel County Board of Education, said the board wants to increase bus drivers‚Äô pay not only as a show of appreciation but also to give students and parents stability. ‚ÄúIt is a critical role,‚Äù Ellis said. Besides giving drivers and attendants pay raises, Superintendent Arlotto has also proposed setting aside federal funds to add $2,000 signing bonuses for new hires. as well as retention bonuses for existing drivers. The board‚Äôs request is subject to approval from County Executive Steuart Pittman. While the bonus pay requires a green light from the County Council, the bonuses could be approved immediately.

Since March, GoGuardian‚Äôs Beacon software has identified nine students as having a severe mental health crisis. All were taken to an emergency room, Stacey Davis, the city schools coordinator of media and instructional technology, told The Baltimore Sun. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School But the practice, which came about as the system loaned out laptops for students‚Äô home use during the pandemic, is raising questions about privacy and equity. Two recent reports warn that such technology could be used for disciplinary purposes, unintentionally out LGBTQ students or squash student expression. They also note that economically disadvantaged students may be tracked more frequently since school-owned laptops may be their only devices. ‚ÄúPrivacy and equity was not being considered as much as it needs to be,‚Äù said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington and co-author of one of the reports. ‚ÄúStudent activity monitoring is quite widespread.‚Äù When there‚Äôs an alert on weekends and at night, when school psychologists or social workers aren‚Äôt available, a school police dispatcher tries to call the family. If there‚Äôs no answer, an officer goes to the home to talk to the family, Davis said. Officers show parents a copy of the alert and what their child typed, then ask to see the student, school police Chief Akil Hamm said. Only once have officers taken a student to the emergency room, and it was at the parents‚Äô request, Hamm said. Baltimore schools have gotten 786 alerts from Beacon since March. Of those, clinicians responded 401 times and school police went to homes 12 times. In addition to the nine students referred to an emergency room, 12 students were referred to a crisis response center. Having school police arrive at a family‚Äôs home could look unsupportive and punitive, said Larry Simmons, president of the system‚Äôs Parent Community Advisory Board. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúSchool police are not social workers,‚Äù he said. The monitoring doesn‚Äôt concern Baltimore City Council of PTAs President Deborah Demery. ‚ÄúAs far as being concerned personally, I feel much better they are monitoring and they are able to get those kids the help. It is a safeguard and it is working,‚Äù Demery said. Society has to balance the risks of invading privacy and the loss of privacy for the common good, said Sharon A. Hoover, co-director of the National Center for School Mental Health at the University of Maryland. Hoover, who is also a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry, said she believes there are good intentions behind the technology ‚Äúand at the same time, they are raising questions and concerns around privacy.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo I think there is some positive potential in protecting students from suicide? Yes, I do,‚Äù she said.

While getting two doses of vaccine creates a strong immune response that reduces the risk of severe disease by more than 90%, the protection against milder and asymptomatic infections drops off gradually. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School That‚Äôs why Pfizer has asked for and received US Food and Drug Administration authorization to add boosters for many people who are six months out from vaccination. But should others be seeking boosters, too? How much should people be worrying? ‚ÄúI think that we expect that immunity will slowly wane, over time, but it‚Äôs not a reason for people to panic,‚Äù said Dr. Ann Falsey, a specialist in viral respiratory diseases at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like suddenly one day you‚Äôre completely susceptible, like you were before you were vaccinated,‚Äù added Falsey, who is helping lead clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are all standing up pretty well ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson ‚Äî for severe disease,‚Äù Falsey told CNN. ‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs not to say that we might not eventually get to a point where we really need people to get boosters to prevent more severe illness. But, really, the majority of the breakthrough infections are colds, maybe flu-like illness ‚Äî not the scary illnesses that we were facing before,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúSo my main message is, don‚Äôt panic. You‚Äôre going to be okay.‚Äù That hasn‚Äôt stopped Americans from flocking to get boosters. This past week more people were getting booster shots than were getting their first round of a coronavirus vaccine. By Friday, more than 7 million Americans had received either booster shots or the third round of vaccines authorized for people with immunocompromising conditions who likely did not get adequate responses to the first two shots. This week,  two more studies  added to the growing evidence that immunity from Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine drops off. One study from Israel covered 4,800 health care workers and showed antibody levels wane rapidly after two doses of vaccine, ‚Äúespecially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.‚Äù A second study from Qatar showed protection from the Pfizer vaccine peaked in the first month after vaccination and then began to wane. ‚ÄúThese findings suggest that a large proportion of the vaccinated population could lose its protection against infection in the coming months, perhaps increasing the potential for new epidemic waves,‚Äù the team wrote in a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. How can protection wane against mild or asymptomatic infection while staying strong against severe disease? It‚Äôs because the human immune system is complex. Antibodies form the first line of defense, stopping a virus from getting into some cells in the body. This is the protection that starts to wear off after time. But there‚Äôs a second line of defense ‚Äî cell-based immunity. Cells called B cells and T cells can take longer to generate than antibodies, but they provide a longer-lived, broader defense against infection and are responsible for decreases in severe infections. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall So while people may be susceptible to mild illness after they‚Äôve been vaccinated, they‚Äôre much less likely to get really sick, end up in the hospital or die. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a lot of reasons people don‚Äôt want to get sick. They don‚Äôt want to pass it to loved ones. People don‚Äôt want to pass it to young children that can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet,‚Äù Falsey said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been saying for months that‚Äôs why even fully vaccinated people need to continue taking precautions against infection ‚Äî wearing masks when around a lot of other people who may or may not be vaccinated, especially indoors, and making sure rooms are well ventilated. The FDA is considering applications later this month from both Moderna  and Johnson & Johnson  to authorize booster doses of their vaccines. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said he thinks a third dose of vaccine will become part of the standard regimen for Covid-19. ‚ÄúThey just don‚Äôt need to storm the pharmacies and panic.‚Äù The people getting boosters now should have been among the first to have been vaccinated ‚Äî in January, February and March. They include people 65 and older, adults with conditions putting them at risk of severe disease and people in occupations or living conditions that put them at higher than average risk of infection. Everyone else should cool it for now. ‚ÄúThey just don‚Äôt need to storm the pharmacies and panic,‚Äù Falsey said. People should not go ahead and get booster doses if it hasn‚Äôt been six months since their last dose of Pfizer vaccine, because they will not get the best immune response, Fauci said in a White House briefing last month. ‚ÄúThere will be temptations, for example, for people who recently got vaccinated to not wait for the six month period of time,‚Äù Fauci said. But waiting for several months after the initial immunization to boost helps produce a stronger response. Immune system cells that help restore waning immunity respond more robustly if they are allowed to go into a resting state after the first round of vaccination. That said, most people should eventually plan on getting boosters, Falsey said. ‚ÄúProbably it‚Äôs going to be true of any of the vaccines, not just Pfizer ‚Äî we‚Äôll benefit from boosting immunity. That‚Äôs not the same thing as saying it‚Äôs critically necessary,‚Äù she said. While people who have recovered from an infection have some protection, they‚Äôre even more protected if they get vaccinated, too. ‚ÄúI think that, depending on your own natural immunity because you feel like you‚Äôre a strong person is like playing Russian roulette,‚Äù Falsey said. Even young, seemingly healthy people have become seriously ill from Covid-19 and have died from it. ‚ÄúI would never depend only on my natural immunity to weather this virus. It‚Äôs a very, very bad actor,‚Äù Falsey said.

(WJZ) ‚Äî  A Navy nuclear engineer and his wife could both face life in prison if convicted of  espionage charges related to a plot to sell military secrets to a foreign government. Jonathan Toebbe, 42, and his wife, Diana, 45, both of Annapolis, appeared Tuesday in federal court in West Virginia to face charges of conspiracy to communicate restricted data and communication of restricted data in violation of the Atomic Energy Act. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The couple were ordered to remain in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service pending the outcomes of their detention hearings on Friday morning. Each of the charges carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, a $100,000 fine and a five-year term of supervised release, U.S.¬†Magistrate Judge Robert¬†W.¬†Trumble told the couple. ‚ÄúThe consequences here are monumental. They are seeking monumental consequences‚Äù said University of Maryland School of Law professor Michael Greenberger, who has no ties to the case. The charges stem from a federal complaint that accuses the couple of trying to sell confidential information, including nuclear submarine schematics, to an unnamed foreign power. According to the complaint, the plot began with an unsolicited package Jonathan Toebbe sent to a foreign government in April 2020, a package that was later handed over to the FBI. ‚ÄúI apologize for this poor translation into your language. Please forward this letter to your military intelligence agency. I believe this information will be of great value to your nation. This is not a hoax,‚Äù Toebbe allegedly wrote. But instead of making contact with foreign military intelligence, Toebbe was put in touch with the FBI, which set up a sting operation using an undercover agent who posed as a foreign contact. Authorities say after working out details for payment and delivery of the data, Toebbe crossed state lines on multiple occasions to drop off memory cards containing sensitive data as part of the arrangement. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall According to the complaint, the memory cards were concealed inside ordinary items that included everything from a peanut butter sandwich to a pack of gum. At times, the complaint said, Diana Toebbe acted as a lookout for her husband. The year-long investigation resulted in the couple‚Äôs arrests Saturday in Jefferson County, West Virginia. Greenberger, the law professor, said there are expectations in place when someone, such as Toebbe, is granted multiple high-level security clearances. ‚ÄúOne expects, quite rightly, the people handling this information are loyal to the United States government,‚Äù Greenberger said. Based on financial affidavits detailing the couple‚Äôs income, assets and debts, they will be assigned court-appointed attorneys to represent them in court. Notably, Diana Toebbe hedged somewhat when asked if the court documents accurately represented the couple‚Äôs finances. ‚ÄúTo the best of my knowledge, which is limited,‚Äù she said.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by 0.03% to 3.85%. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 3 to 762. Of those hospitalized, 558 remain in acute care and 192 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 546,552 total confirmed cases and 10,413 deaths. There are 3,945,098 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,127,860 doses. Of those, 4,001,501 are first doses with 5,074 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,638,404 second doses, 4,088 in the last day. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 306,694 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 316 in the last day. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 181,261 additional or booster vaccine doses, 9,957 in the last day. The state reported 84.7% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 25,476 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, October 13. Less than 0.71% of fully vaccinated Marylanders have later tested positive. Of those cases, 1,842 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 10.8% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. 233 fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Aside from their Week 4 win over the Denver Broncos, every game has been decided in the final minutes with a margin of victory smaller than a touchdown. That includes Monday night‚Äôs overtime win against the Indianapolis Colts. The Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns are both coming off of close losses. The Bengals let a win over the Green Bay Packers slip through their fingers. The Browns couldn‚Äôt escape Los Angeles with a win, despite dropping 42 points on the Chargers. And then the Steelers continued to find their way, topping the Denver Broncos for their second win. READ MORE:  Bengals Visit Ravens With AFC North Lead On The Line CBS Pittsburgh sports anchor Bob Pompeani looks at the four AFC North matchups in Week 6. All times listed are Eastern. Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Cincinnati Bengals @ Detroit Lions, Sunday, October 17 @ 1:00 p.m. The Bengals head to Detroit with a 3-2 record, though they probably should be tied with the Ravens atop the AFC North. Kicker Evan McPherson missed game-winning field goal attempts late in the fourth quarter and again in overtime. (Packers kicker Mason Crosby missed multiple attempts himself.) The bright side is that Joe Burrow once again put Cincinnati in a position to win. He threw for 281 yards and two touchdowns and two interceptions. The defense mostly held up against Aaron Rodgers, sacking him twice and knocking him down five times. They‚Äôll get an easier matchup in Week 6 against the winless Lions. Detroit just lost another heartbreaker on a last-second field goal, when Greg Joseph hit a 54-yarder with time expiring. They‚Äôre due for a win. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve come oh so close to winning, and a couple of games that really should have won,‚Äù said Pompeani. ‚ÄúTucker‚Äôs 66-yard field goal, and then what happened last week actually got to a Dan Campbell, the head coach. He broke down in the media press conference afterwards. So both of these teams really need a win.‚Äù The Lions are desperate, which makes them dangerous for the Bengals. Jared Goff is capable under center. And Campbell‚Äôs emotion-filled interview may have inspired Detroit to play over its head. Their bad luck will eventually run out. Los Angeles Chargers @ Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, October 17 @ 1:00 p.m. The Chargers used to find ways to lose games. Now they‚Äôre finding ways to win them. Just witness the 47-42 shootout in Cleveland last week. That came two weeks after a 30-24 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Justin Herbert is emerging as one of NFL‚Äôs best young quarterbacks. He torched a strong Browns defense for 398 yards and four touchdowns, giving him the most 300-yard games of any QB in their first two seasons. He has plenty of help on offense, of course, with game-changing talent at the receiver and running back spots. Mike Williams alone had eight catches for 165 yards and two touchdowns. The Chargers will face a Ravens teams that‚Äôs enjoyed its own fair share of success in close games. According to Pompeani, ‚Äúthis is the marquee matchup, especially after the Ravens won the way they did on Monday night. Just a brilliant performance by Lamar Jackson. Really one of the first times I‚Äôve seen a guy almost single-handedly carry a team to a win in that second half. But Justin Herbert‚Äôs done the same, a shootout with Cleveland last week.‚Äù READ MORE:  'Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!' On The Big Screen At M&T Bank Stadium Tonight Both teams come in 4-1, riding the strong play of their young quarterbacks. Jackson threw for an absurd 442 yards and four TDs on 37-43 passing. ‚ÄúTwo of the bright young stars,‚Äù Pompeani noted. ‚ÄúI think this is going to be a win for the Chargers. They typically lose games like this, going west to east. But they‚Äôve been winning a lot of games I didn‚Äôt expect them to. And I would expect them to win this game, because Baltimore has won a lot of games that I, quite frankly, thought they were going to lose. Arizona Cardinals @ Cleveland Browns, Sunday, October 17 @ 4:05 p.m. After a loss to the Chargers, the Browns look to bounce back against the Cardinals. However, Arizona, to date, is the NFL‚Äôs only undefeated team. They‚Äôve put up 30-plus points in four of their first five games, and Kyler Murray is playing at the top of his game. So far he has 1,512 yards passing, 10 TDs, and a rating of 113. But he‚Äôs also been sacked 10 times and taken a few hits along the way. ‚ÄúArizona has been walking the line,‚Äù Pompeani said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre undefeated. Sooner or later that‚Äôs going to end. And I think that Kyler Murray is going to be under a lot of pressure. This defense in Cleveland is for real. The ground game of the Browns is also for real. So I think they‚Äôll control the time of possession and win at home against Arizona. The Browns defense is allowing under 300 yards per game, one of only four NFL teams. They also have 16 sacks so far, tied for third best in the NFL. Myles Garrett accounts for seven of them. The two-headed beast that is the Browns run game includes Nick Chubb, who‚Äôs piled up 523 yards, and Kareem Hunt, who has 293 yards. Cleveland leads the NFL in rushing yards. The Cardinals don‚Äôt match up well with these strengths. Their run defense is one of the worst in the league, allowing 139 yards per game and 5.4 yards per carry. Seattle Seahawks @ Pittsburgh Steelers, Sunday, October 17 @ 8:20 p.m. The Seahawks find themselves in the unusual position of not having Russell Wilson under center. He had  surgery on his finger  and could miss six to eight weeks. That leaves Seattle in the hands of Geno Smith, who will lead them into Pittsburgh in Week 6. Smith went 10-17 for 131 yards and a touchdown after Wilson‚Äôs injury. He also threw an interception. ‚ÄúGeno Smith, one thing I‚Äôll say about him is that he has the same kind of game skills, which is to say he can do the things on the run,‚Äù according to Pompeani. ‚ÄúHe can break tackles. He uses his legs to buy some time. But this is going to be tough.‚Äù Smith will have to rely on an offense that‚Äôs been middle-of-the-road all season. The running game is averaging just 104 yards per game, while the passing game is good for 247 yards per game. The Steelers are facing their own injury issues with offensive implications. Ben Roethlisberger has been banged up much of the season. And receiver  JuJu Smith-Schuster  will miss the rest of the season with a shoulder injury. This could lead to more reliance on the ground game. Najee Harris ran for 122 yards against the Broncos, the first 100-yard game of his pro career. ‚ÄúI think the Steelers are going to find this run game to be something they‚Äôre going to lean on moving forward,‚Äù said Pompeani. ‚ÄúNajee Harris is going to get another 100 yards.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Turgeon Still Hoping For Long Postseason Run At Maryland The Steelers also come in with a bit of extra motivation. ‚ÄúThe Steelers are playing at home,‚Äù Pompeani pointed out. ‚ÄúThey want to get to .500.

The recognition from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus came more than a decade after the publication of ‚ÄúThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,‚Äù Rebecca Skloot‚Äôs book about the discrimination in health care Black Americans faced, the life-saving innovations made possible by Lacks‚Äô cells and her family‚Äôs legal fight over their unauthorized use.

Lacks died of cervical cancer on Oct. 4, 1951 at age 31. The tissue taken from her at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore provided the first human cells to be successfully cloned. Reproduced infinitely ever since, HeLa cells have become a cornerstone of modern medicine, including the development of the polio vaccine, genetic mapping and even COVID-19 vaccines. Tedros noted that Lacks lived at a time when racial discrimination was legal in the United States and that it remains widespread, even if no longer legal in most countries.

She is one of many women of color whose bodies have been misused by science,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe placed her trust in the health system so she could receive treatment. But the system took something from her without her knowledge or consent.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe medical technologies that were developed from this injustice have been used to perpetuate further injustice because they have not been shared equitably around the world,‚Äù Tedros added. The HeLa cell line ‚Äî a name derived from the first two letters of Henrietta Lacks‚Äô first and last names ‚Äî was a scientific breakthrough. Tedros said the cells were ‚Äúfoundational‚Äù in the development of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, which can eliminate the cancer that took her life. As of last year, WHO said, less than 25% of the world‚Äôs low-income countries and fewer than 30% of lower-middle-income countries had access to HPV vaccines through national immunization programs, compared to over 85% of high-income countries.

Nationally, the average daily rate of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 are on the decline. In the last week, the daily average number of infections has dropped by more than 15,000 to more than 86,000, and an average of 200 fewer people are dying per day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Still, an average of about 1,500 people died every day in the last week of Covid-19, according to JHU data. Much of the national improvement can be attributed to Southern states coming out of the worst of the variant surge, Gottlieb told CNN. But not all regions are faring so well. Numbers are ticking up in the West and Midwest, and it is still unclear how heavy the impact will be in the Northeast, he said. Gottlieb has predicted the worst of it will be over for much of the country around Thanksgiving and prevalence levels will decline around Christmas, but not all health officials are so certain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that we can predict at this time that we‚Äôre not going to see a winter surge,‚Äù CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. ‚ÄúI really think it‚Äôs too early for us to celebrate and say that the worst is behind us.‚Äù Before any celebration, the US needs to keep the trajectory of cases, hospitalizations and deaths going down, a feat which depends on vaccinating more people, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday. ‚ÄúWe have about 68 million people in this country who are eligible to be vaccinated who are not yet vaccinated,‚Äù said the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ‚ÄúWe need the overwhelming proportion of those unvaccinated people to be vaccinated and then we can be quite confident that if we can do that, you will not see a resurgence.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis really depends upon us and our ability to rise to the occasion and get people vaccinated,‚Äù Fauci said. Vaccines are key to accelerating through the pandemic  Vaccines, in addition to other tools like testing, are what will help bring the Covid-19 pandemic into its endemic stage in the US, Gottlieb said Monday. When a virus becomes endemic, it poses a persistent risk of infection but is not causing large numbers of cases with severe disease and death. ‚ÄúThe reason why we‚Äôre going to get through this and the reason why we‚Äôre going to accelerate our way through this pandemic to an endemic phase with this virus is because of the vaccine,‚Äù he told CNN‚Äôs Chris Cuomo. ‚ÄúIf you look at past pandemics, they‚Äôve lasted upwards of five years. This pandemic probably won‚Äôt last that long for the West,‚Äù he said. Gottlieb said treatments and testing are also important, but vaccines are ‚Äúa key part‚Äù of fighting the pandemic. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúThe fact that we could build a wall of immunity through vaccination, and not just mass-infecting the population, is going to be how we accelerate our way out of the pandemic into an endemic phase with this virus where we can hopefully keep it at bay,‚Äù Gottlieb said. Meanwhile, Pfizer and BioNTech said last week they are seeking an emergency use authorization for a vaccine for children as young as 5 years old. If approved, the increased accessibility will benefit the health of young children and the communities they occupy, experts said. ‚ÄúWe will really depend on kids, younger kids, getting vaccinated in order to increase the overall immune protection,‚Äù Wen said. The number of new Covid-19 cases in children remains ‚Äúexceptionally high,‚Äù according to new data from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published Monday. Children represented 24.8% of weekly reported Covid cases last week, when 148,222 cases were reported. More than 750,000 child cases have been added over the past four weeks, the AAP said. Cumulatively, more than six million total child cases have been reported since the start of the pandemic and children have made up 16.3% of all cases. Vaccine mandates work, Fauci says  As part of the drive to increase vaccinations, many health experts are calling for mandates in schools, workplaces and businesses. Fauci told CNN‚Äôs Wolf Blitzer the federal government is trying to persuade people to get vaccinated on their own, but some may need to be required to do so. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve obviously been trying very hard,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúWe try to get trusted messengers out there and try and get this away from being an ideological or political statement, get back into the realm of pure public health, and try to convince people,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúI mean, we don‚Äôt like to be telling people what they need to do with regard to vaccines. But we know that mandates work.‚Äù But while many institutions have made the decision to mandate vaccines for their students, employees and clients, some states leaders are less inclined. On Monday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order prohibiting any entities from requiring individuals to get vaccinated. ‚ÄúThe COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,‚Äù said Abbott.

The monthly checks of up to $300 per child will continue through the end of 2021. And up to $1,800 more per child will arrive at tax time next year. The amount of each parent‚Äôs total deposit depends on their annual income, the number of children and the ages of those children. When added together, the money may add up to more than any of the first three stimulus checks. But what if a parent wants to opt out of these advance payments in favor of a one-time payment? Qualifying For The Updated Credit The updated Child Tax Credit is based on parents‚Äô modified adjusted gross income (AGI), as reflected on their 2020 tax filing. (AGI is the sum of one‚Äôs wages, interest, dividends, alimony, retirement distributions and other sources of income minus certain deductions, such as student loan interest, alimony payments and retirement contributions.) The amount  phases out  at a rate of $50 for every $1,000 of annual income beyond $75,000 for an individual and beyond $150,000 for a married couple. The benefit is fully refundable, meaning it does not depend on the recipient‚Äôs current tax burden. Qualifying families receive the full amount, regardless of what they owe in taxes. There is no limit to the number of dependents that can be claimed. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The IRS is paying $3,600 per child to parents of children up to age five. That changes to $3,000 total for each child ages six through 17. Half of the total is being paid as six monthly payments and half as a 2021 tax credit. The IRS has made a one-time payment of $500 for dependents age 18 or full-time college students up through age 24.   #IRSTaxTip : Non-traditional families may qualify for advance  #ChildTaxCredit  payments. Check out the  #IRS  eligibility guidelines and see if your family qualifies:  https://t.co/9J5HB58rqX *Thanks for sharing your artwork, Kayleigh*  pic.twitter.com/QklAjdqPjp   ‚Äî IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 13, 2021 As an example, suppose a married couple has a four-year-old child and an eight-year-old child and showed an annual joint income of $120,000 on their 2020 taxes. The IRS would send them a monthly check for $550 starting in July. That‚Äôs $300 per month ($3,600 / 12) for the younger child and $250 per month ($3,000 / 12) for the older child. Those checks would last through December. The couple would then receive the $3,300 balance ‚Äî $1,800 ($300 X 6) for the younger child and $1,500 ($250 X 6) for the older child ‚Äî as part of their 2021 tax refund. Parents of a child who ages out of an age bracket are being paid the lesser amount. That means if a five-year-old turns six in 2021, the parents are receiving a total credit of $3,000 for the year, not $3,600. Likewise, if a 17-year-old turns 18 in 2021, the parents have received $500, not $3,000. An income increase in 2021 to an amount above the $75,000 ($150,000) threshold could lower a household‚Äôs Child Tax Credit. The IRS has confirmed that they‚Äôll soon allow claimants to adjust their income and custodial information online, thus lowering their payments. Failure to do so could increase one‚Äôs tax bill or reduce one‚Äôs tax refund once 2021 taxes are filed. Eligibility requires that a dependent be part of the household for at least half of the year and be at least half supported by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who makes above $95,000 ($170,000) ‚Äî where the income limits phase out ‚Äî will  not be eligible  for the expanded credit. But they can still claim the existing $2,000 credit per child. Opting Out Of Advance Payments Parents who filed taxes in 2019 and/or 2020 and meet the income requirements automatically started receiving advance Child Tax Credit payments back in July. But some parents may prefer a lump-sum payment at tax time rather than monthly payments and a smaller tax credit. The deadline to opt out before the October 15 payment has already passed. But the deadline to opt out of the November 15 payment is November 1. (Subsequent opt-out deadlines for payments going forward will occur three days before the first Thursday of the month being opted out of.) The  Child Tax Credit Update Portal  allows users to make sure they are registered to receive advance payments, update bank account information for direct deposit, and change an address. It also lets recipients view their payment history and unenroll from advance payments in favor of a one-time credit when filing their 2021 taxes. Updating dependents and changing income are other features coming to the portal. To access this portal, users need an IRS username or an ID.me account. ID.me is a sign-in service used by various government agencies, including the IRS, Social Security Administration and Treasury Department, to authenticate users. Users need valid photo identification to create an account. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall From the portal page, a user should click the ‚ÄúManage Advance Payments‚Äù button. Log into your account on the next page, or create an account. Once logged in, a user can view their eligibility and change how the Credit will be received. Reasons To Opt Out Of Advance Payments Every household‚Äôs financial circumstances are unique. Every family handles their finances in the way that works best for them. And then there are simple matters of preference. For these and other reasons, the default scenario of advance monthly payments followed by a lump-sum credit may not be ideal. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an advance payment based off of your estimated benefit, given what your income is going to be in 2021, based off of what your income was 2020 or 2019,‚Äù says Stephen Nu√±ez, the Lead Researcher on Guaranteed Income at the Jain Family Institute, an applied research organization in the social sciences. (Nu√±ez studies cash welfare policy, that includes field work to answer policy-relevant questions about the social safety net.) ‚ÄúSo there is a possibility, of course, that your income changes from year to year, so that the estimate is actually fairly far off from what your actual income is.‚Äù Given the decline of the economy in 2020 as compared to its surge in 2021, drastic income changes seem plausible if not expected. A parent who lost her job in March of 2020 and found a new one in January of 2021 could earn more money this year than last year. However, the IRS will base her monthly Child Tax Credit payments on her 2020 income. If the new job pushes her above the income threshold, the IRS will overpay her. ‚ÄúImagine a world where based off of your income in 2020, they give you $3,000,‚Äù Nu√±ez suggested. ‚ÄúIt turns out that based off your income in 2021, you actually only were supposed to receive only $2,400. Well then at tax time, there would be a claw-back. They will say, sorry, we overpaid you, because our guess was incorrect. So you need to pay us back $600.‚Äù The IRS will be holding half of the overall Child Tax Credit in reserve. So, using Nu√±ez‚Äôs example, that $600 wouldn‚Äôt have to be repaid per se. It would simply be deducted from the other half of the credit. This parent would receive a $900 credit at tax time next year, rather than the $1,500 balance. For families navigating a divorce or child custody issues, advance payments of the Child Tax Credit could create additional difficulties. A divorce will break a household into multiple households. The $150,000 threshold for a married couple becomes $112,500 for each head of the new household. That could create complications based on individual incomes and who has custody of the children. As Nu√±ez puts it, ‚Äúif you‚Äôve had a change in household composition. Imagine you got divorced, or you no longer have a child, and they‚Äôre sending you $3,000 for a child that you don‚Äôt have in your life. That money, you‚Äôre going to have to pay it back.‚Äù Opting out of advance monthly payments in favor of a lump-sum payment at tax time would simplify the process of reorganizing a household into multiple households. It also could make financial planning easier. The choice depends on individual circumstances. Monthly payments help people smooth out income volatility month to month and handle unforeseen expenses, like a car repair. A onetime payment lets people be certain they will have money for a bigger purchase without setting that money aside themselves. It‚Äôs a sort of induced savings plan. MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized Nu√±ez related the situation to research on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is paid as a lump sum at tax time. ‚ÄúPart of it is that some people really like the idea of receiving all that money at once,‚Äù Nu√±ez said. ‚ÄúIt helps them plan for big purchases, for down payments on cars, for buying a refrigerator, whatever. And that‚Äôs just the way that they would prefer to receive their money. They may also, to be honest, they may feel like if they get the money on a monthly basis, they‚Äôre going to have trouble setting aside money, calculating how much money to set aside or perhaps they may feel like it‚Äôs a temptation to spend it, rather than to save it.‚Äù                                 ", "sentiment": 0.08253628316128317, "subjectivity": 0.3466848429348431, "wordcount": 1584}

U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander ruled late Tuesday that Church Militant is likely to succeed on its argument that the city violated its free speech rights and is discriminating against the group based on its political views. ‚ÄúThey saw a concern that the message that they thought was going to be expressed might cause problems in the community, there might be counter-protests, there might even be, God forbid, some degree of violence,‚Äù said Ruther. But Ruther said that crosses a  constitutional line , echoing what U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander ruled. He said the right to free speech means ‚Äúpeople who express even unfavorable or dangerous ideas should be allowed to have their moment to express them.‚Äù READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúWe are disappointed by the Court‚Äôs decision and potential threat to public safety if this event ensues,‚Äù a spokesperson for Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said in a statement to WJZ. ‚ÄúThe proposed rally is slated to take place on Baltimore City property, and we have a responsibility to protect our property and fellow citizens. We remain committed to this charge and will appeal this decision.‚Äù The city fears violence in the expected crowd of 3,000 people and cites incendiary speakers who are expected to attend‚Äîincluding Steve Bannon, the former Chief Strategist for President Trump, and  Milo Yiannopoulos,  a right-wing provocateur. A  2017 appearance  by Yiannapoulos led to violence in Berkeley, California. Bannon called for the beheading of  Dr. Anthony Fauci  on his podcast last year. Until the conclusion of the litigation, no city officials or employees can prohibit the group from entering into a contract with the pavilion‚Äôs manager, Hollander said. The judge did not set any expectations on the terms of the contract. Hollander said in her decision she ‚Äúanticipates good faith negotiations, but expresses no opinion on the terms of a contract.‚Äù Church Militant said there was no violence during a similar protest at the bishops‚Äô conference in Baltimore three years ago. That event drew about 1,000 people. This year‚Äôs rally, planned for Nov. 16, has an expected crowd of 3,000 people.

In an email to WJZ on Tuesday, the office revealed that the 17-year-old‚Äôs cause of death was cardiac arrest, multi-system organ failure, accidental trauma, and a traumatic brain injury. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School ‚ÄúThese cases are very unfortunate and they remind us of the severity of this injury,‚Äù said Dr. Kevin Crutchfield, a neurologist who helped to write Maryland‚Äôs concussion protocol laws. Dr. Crutchfield does not know the specifics of Gorham‚Äôs case but described what happens in the body when an athlete gets a traumatic brain injury. ‚ÄúIf the body stops suddenly, the brain can still shift around inside the skull and bang up against the inside of the skull. And it‚Äôs the transfer of that force into the tissue of the brain that has energy that leads to chemical changes and that is a traumatic brain injury. It can either cause bruising, bleeding,‚Äù said Dr. Crutchfield. Dr. Crutchfield said traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more severe than concussions. He describes concussions as a self-resolving process, whereas TBI improves, but does not fully resolve. Gorham was a senior at Mergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School. He was injured during a game back in September and died a few weeks later. In a statement to WJZ, Baltimore City Schools said: READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall During interscholastic football games, such as this one, City Schools arranges for a medic to be on the scene.

The medic ensures that the district Athletic Department receives information regarding any injury that requires medical attention. Gorham‚Äôs mother, Shantres Shaw told WJZ the team was like family. ‚ÄúIt was a brotherhood to him, he loved his team members his coaches, his family and he was just amazing,‚Äù said Shaw.

Over several months, Toebbe arranged to deliver batches of data to his contact by hiding memory cards inside ordinary objects ‚Äî a sandwich, a pack of gum, a bandage ‚Äî and dropping them off at several ocations in Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, the documents state.

If his plan to start a new outlet in Baltimore proves successful, he hopes it can be replicated in other markets where local newspapers have suffered years of staff cuts. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no industry that I can think of more integral to a working democracy than the local-news business,‚Äù he said. Faced with the prospect of being acquired by Alden Global Capital, a hedge fund dubbed ‚Äú the grim reaper of American newspapers ‚Äù by  Vanity Fair , a group of  Baltimore Sun  journalists in 2020 launched the Save Our Sun campaign and lobbied for local ownership to turn the newspaper into a nonprofit. Other Tribune papers soon followed suit. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Bainum came forward as an interested buyer of  The Sun , and  reportedly reached a deal  to purchase the newspaper for $65 million once Alden Global Capital acquired Tribune Publishing. But Alden added a licensing deal that would have added millions to the price, according to the  Atlantic  article, so Bainum tried to line up other backers to put in a bid for Tribune Publishing as a whole. Tribune shareholders approved Alden Global Capital‚Äôs bid last May, not long after Swiss billionaire Hansj√∂rg Wyss  reportedly dropped  his support for the rival bid. Bainum reached out to one of Alden Global Capital‚Äôs co-founders, Heath Freeman, after the purchase was completed to inquire about buying  The Sun  separately but never got a response, according to the  Atlantic  article. In the story, Freeman defended Alden‚Äôs cost-cutting practices.

(AP) ‚Äî  Colts owner Jim Irsay was so impressed with Lamar Jackson that¬† he took to Twitter ¬†the next day ‚Äî and said the Baltimore quarterback‚Äôs performance against Indianapolis might have been the best in NFL history. And Irsay, as he explained in his tweet, was at Wrigley Field the day Gale Sayers scored six touchdowns. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The superlatives keep rolling in for Jackson, who threw for 442 yards and four touchdowns in¬† a 31-25 overtime win ¬†over Indianapolis on Monday night. It wasn‚Äôt quite a perfect night for Jackson, who fumbled near the goal line, but after that turnover the Ravens scored touchdowns on their final four possessions. The quarterback who has faced questions about his passing ability finished 37 of 43 in that department, leading Baltimore to a victory on a night when its running game wasn‚Äôt up to its usual standard. ‚ÄúMan, it‚Äôs special. He‚Äôs just scratching the surface on how good he can be,‚Äù Ravens defensive lineman Calais Campbell said. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs still 24 years old. I mean, this is crazy ‚Äî what he‚Äôs capable of doing. I know he‚Äôs notorious for what he can do with his legs, and I feel like he got a lot of disrespect on his arm talent, and I think a lot of people are eating their words right now.‚Äù Jackson won MVP honors two seasons ago, and it‚Äôs been clear for a while that his blend of passing and running can be really difficult to defend. In truth, he‚Äôs been pretty efficient throwing the ball throughout his career, completing 64.5% of his passes with 76 touchdowns and 21 interceptions. Still, it was fair to point out that Jackson hasn‚Äôt attempted more than 401 passes in a season ‚Äî in a league where top quarterbacks routinely surpass 500. If you added Jackson‚Äôs passing and rushing yardage, he accounted for 4,333 yards in his MVP season but just 3,762 last season. The Ravens finished first in the NFL in rushing and last in passing in 2020 ‚Äî and that added up to a No. 19 ranking in total offense. This season the Ravens are No. 1 in total offense. Jackson‚Äôs passing and rushing adds up to 1,860 yards ‚Äî also the best mark in the league. That should make any remaining critics of Jackson‚Äôs passing ability a little quieter. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre going to stop talking about it. I don‚Äôt really know,‚Äù Jackson said. ‚ÄúAll I know is my focus is on winning.‚Äù Whether by design or necessity ‚Äî Baltimore‚Äôs top two running backs went down with season-ending injuries ‚Äî Jackson is throwing more, and he‚Äôs handling it impressively. He‚Äôs averaging 33 pass attempts per game, up from 25 last season. ‚ÄúLook at the last couple of games, he‚Äôs just calm, composed, and he‚Äôs a leader, man,‚Äù tight end Mark Andrews said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we all look to. There were mistakes. There were a couple mistakes that were made, but he just keeps on coming.‚Äù Jackson is also doing this without all the targets he was expecting to play with. Rookie receiver Rashod Bateman hasn‚Äôt played yet because of groin problems, and newcomer Sammy Watkins left Monday‚Äôs game with a hamstring injury. Jackson ended up targeting Andrews and Marquise Brown a combined 23 times against the Colts. They caught 20 passes for 272 yards and all four Baltimore touchdowns. Jackson‚Äôs big game came on a night when the Ravens had their streak of 43 consecutive 100-yard rushing games snapped. After sputtering through the first half, Baltimore unleashed Jackson in the second. He threw for 335 yards after halftime. ‚ÄúHe definitely went to another level in that game. That level was pretty impressive I would say, and it was awesome to watch,‚Äù coach John Harbaugh said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not surprised.‚Äù This coming week, Jackson faces Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers in a matchup of division leaders.

With prices surging worldwide for heating oil, natural gas and other fuels, the U.S. government said Wednesday it expects households to see their heating bills jump as much as 54% compared to last winter. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Nearly half the homes in the U.S. use natural gas for heat, and they could pay an average $746 this winter, 30% more than a year ago. Those in the Midwest could get particularly pinched, with bills up an estimated 49%, and this could be the most expensive winter for natural-gas heated homes since 2008-2009. The second-most used heating source for homes is electricity, making up 41% of the country, and those households could see a more modest 6% increase to $1,268. Homes using heating oil, which make up 4% of the country, could see a 43% increase ‚Äî more than $500 ‚Äî to $1,734. The sharpest increases are likely for homes that use propane, which account for 5% of U.S. households. This winter is forecast to be slightly colder across the country than last year. That means people will likely be burning more fuel to keep warm, on top of paying more for each bit of it. If the winter ends up being even colder than forecast, heating bills could be higher than estimated, and vice-versa. The forecast from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is the latest reminder of the higher inflation ripping across the global economy. Earlier Wednesday, the government released a separate report showing that prices were 5.4% higher for U.S. consumers in September than a year ago. That matches the hottest inflation rate since 2008, as a reawakening economy and snarled supply chains push up prices for everything from cars to groceries. The higher prices hit everyone, with pay raises for most workers so far failing to keep up with inflation. But they hurt low-income households in particular. ‚ÄúAfter the beating that people have taken in the pandemic, it‚Äôs like: What‚Äôs next?‚Äù said Carol Hardison, chief executive officer at Crisis Assistance Ministry, which helps people in Charlotte, North Carolina, who are facing financial hardship. She said households coming in for assistance recently have had unpaid bills that are roughly twice as big as they were before the pandemic. They‚Äôre contending with more expensive housing, higher medical bills and sometimes a reduction in their hours worked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what we know about this pandemic: It‚Äôs hit the same people that were already struggling with wages not keeping up with the cost of living,‚Äù she said. To make ends meet, families are cutting deeply. Nearly 22% of Americans had to reduce or forego expenses for basic necessities, such as medicine or food, to pay an energy bill in at least one of the last 12 months, according to a September survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúThis is going to create significant hardship for people in the bottom third of the country,‚Äù said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors‚Äô Association. ‚ÄúYou can tell them to cut back and try to turn down the heat at night, but many low-income families already do that. Energy was already unaffordable to them.‚Äù Many of those families are just now getting through a hot summer where they faced high air-conditioning bills. Congress apportions some money to energy assistance programs for low-income households, but directors of those programs are now watching their purchasing power shrink as fuel costs keep climbing, Wolfe said. The biggest reason for this winter‚Äôs higher heating bills is the recent surge in prices for energy commodities after they dropped to multi-year lows in 2020. Demand has simply grown faster than production as the economy roars back to life following shutdowns caused by the coronavirus. Natural gas in the United States, for example, has climbed to its highest price since 2014 and is up roughly 90% over the last year. The wholesale price of heating oil, meanwhile, has more than doubled in the last 12 months. Another reason for the rise is how global the market for fuels has become. In Europe, strong demand and limited supplies have sent natural gas prices up more than 350% this year. That‚Äôs pushing some of the natural gas produced in the United States to head for ships bound for other countries, adding upward pressure on domestic prices as well. The amount of natural gas in storage inventories is relatively low, according to Barclays analyst Amarpreet Singh. That means there‚Äôs less of a cushion heading into winter heating season. Heating oil prices, meanwhile, are tied closely to the price of crude oil, which has climbed more than 60% this year. Homes affected by those increases are primarily in the Northeast, where the percentage of homes using heating oil has dropped to 18% from 27% over the past decade. ___ AP Writer David Sharp contributed from Portland, Maine.

Like yes, my tribe was getting picked off, but all these people getting picked off were voting for me to go home. It was terrifying, you know. MW-  So how did that change the way you went about playing the game? JR-  I saw that we were losing and that people were going home. I knew that I wanted to flip the game but I was in the bottom rung of the whole tribe with Shan and Ricard. There are so many times that I wanted to flip the game on its head. I wanted to work with Brad and Genie and I wanted to vote out Ricard. But Brad wanted to vote out me for some reason, even though I saved him at tribal council. They wanted to work with the people who want to vote Brad out and to this day I don‚Äôt understand it. I wanted to put myself in a position of power. The problem was I didn‚Äôt have people who wanted to do it with me. My only play was to suck up to the people in power and try to get in good with them so that they‚Äôll take me with them. That‚Äôs why I gave Shan my extra vote and not Ricard. That‚Äôs why I gained Shan my extra vote again because I‚Äôm trying to find a space. There were no other options I only had two votes and so, yeah, there was really nothing else I could do. MW-  It seemed like the tension was really building for Ua but then when you all got reward it seemed like things started to ease up a little bit. I know the game ended quicker than you would have liked but you did get to go on a reward and have that experience at least. What was that like? JR-  Reward was awesome, shout out to Nathan he was my bro! He taught me so much stuff out there. There‚Äôs so many different types of coconuts and he‚Äôs trying to teach me climbing techniques. I was always climbing trees trying to get coconuts. He‚Äôs an amazing man, like the dude is not human. He swims like a fish, he climbs like a spider, he could just crack a coconut in half like it‚Äôs nothing. He‚Äôs awesome.

What went wrong for Ua? JR-  You know, I think a lot of people will blame me for the fact that we didn‚Äôt win that immunity challenge but I was the only one who landed it! I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt show that we switched but we switched other people in. The only thing I‚Äôd change is maybe saying money and actually making it. That‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôd change. MW-  I feel bad bringing this up, but was there any extra salt in the wound afterwards knowing that Deshawn and Danny were trying to lose? JR-  That hurts so bad. I was like I landed two rings, like that wasn‚Äôt that bad, right? Then it‚Äôs like dude is re-tying knots and both Ua and Yase are not even close to done. They were throwing the challenge and we weren‚Äôt even close. That just goes to show how much of a beast Naseer. He was basically going against Deshawn and Danny and still won. MW-  Now at tribal council, obviously you got blindsided. As you said you were trying to build trust with Shan so you have up your extra vote. Walk me through everything that unfolded there. JR-  As tribal council unfolds I couldn‚Äôt make it live and try to make a move because I didn‚Äôt have my extra vote. That was a mistake that I already made and I was like, dang. So the best thing that I can do at tribal council is show them that Genie is not with them and that I am just in case they haven‚Äôt made up their minds. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm said Genie don‚Äôt play your shot in the dark and then I wink at Ricard and Shan to say I‚Äôm with you guys, she‚Äôs not, she doesn‚Äôt even believe you right now. That‚Äôs what I was trying to do at tribal and it didn‚Äôt work but I went for it, made a bad move. MW-  That‚Äôs what  Survivor  is all about, taking your shot. Although it didn‚Äôt work for you this time, would you take another shot down the road at  Survivor ? JR-  110,000,000%, I would do anything to be back out there. The biggest thing for me going back out there is that in pregame a lot of people were high on me. People were saying how this dude did Toastmasters and he‚Äôs athletic and he talks to all these different people and he works with kids; everyone thought I would do well. I feel like I didn‚Äôt show what kind of player I can really be. So I would love to go back and I just want to prove to them that it‚Äôs in me. I promise it‚Äôs in me to be that great survivor player. I couldn‚Äôt execute, I fumbled a lot but now I know a little more about the game and how it‚Äôs actually truly played. That‚Äôs my biggest thing I want to go back so bad. MW-  Hopefully we see you with that second chance but for now congrats on getting on the show at least and thank you for the time today JD! JR-  Thanks bro!

That‚Äôs how we got started.‚Äù   Aanya Thakur (CBS 11)   The way mining works is whenever someone buys or sells cryptocurrency a new unique digital coin needs to be made to ensure security. To do that, computers around the world race to solve a complex math problem. The computer that does it first wins and produces the new coin. That computer is then rewarded with cryptocurrency for themselves.   The odds of any one computer winning are slim, so the key is to have lots of computer servers.¬†With the help of a loan from their father, the Thakur siblings have invested tens of thousands of dollars into their operation.¬†This included buying 145 graphic cards ‚Äì each costing more than $3000.   Most their operation is also no longer in their garage. Instead, the majority of their computer rigs are now located at a secure climate-controlled data center in Dallas.   Mining computers create heat and potential home hazard   To be successful mining for cryptocurrency, you need several high-powered computers running 24 hours a day.¬†These computers get hot ‚Äì sometimes too hot.   Last year, Fort Worth firefighters responded to a house fire on Bamberg Lane on the north side of the city.¬†No one was home at the time as the fire gutted most of the two-story home.¬†When searching through the charred debris in the garage, fire investigators noted finding boxes of graphic cards, the type often used to mine for cryptocurrency.   According to the investigation report, investigators concluded the electrical fire started from a computer server rack in the garage. The renter told firefighters the server rack ‚Äúmined for cryptocurrency.‚Äù   At-home Bitcoin miners struggle to compete with professional operations   When mining for cryptocurrency, at-home miners often must compete against large well-funded mining operations.¬†This is why many at-home miners don‚Äôt mine for Bitcoin and instead mine for less valuable cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum.   The Whinstone facility in Rockdale, Texas is the largest Bitcoin mining operation in North America. The 100-acre facility has more than 115,000 computer servers mining for Bitcoin. Whinstone goes to great lengths to keep their servers from over-heating.   RELATED:  Will The Texas Electric Grid Be Able To Handle State‚Äôs Bitcoin Mining Rush?   The company built a high-tech cooling system in their buildings that sends cold water running through the outside walls, while heat generated from the computers is sucked out through ceiling vents.¬†‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs what a lot of people don‚Äôt realize is the amount of investment that goes into buildings like this,‚Äù said Whinstone CEO Chard Harris.   Whinstone in Rockdale, Texas (CBS 11)   Without major equipment investment, most at-home miners usually make small profits   Because it is hard to compete against the large cryptocurrency miners without major investment, most at-home miners experience to similar to Noah Jost‚Äôs.   When the 10-year-old Bedford student is not playing Fortnight on his computer, he switches his computer over to mine for Ethereum.   Noah Jost (CBS 11)   In the past year, Noah has learned a lot about the cryptocurrency market along with a lesson on striking it rich.¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôve made about $230 total in eight months,‚Äù he said.   Noah said he plans to save his earnings to buy a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù computer so he can ‚Äúearn more money mining.‚Äù                                 ", "sentiment": 0.19255112703388566, "subjectivity": 0.48677414539483493, "wordcount": 663}

Four members of each tribe had to compete in a series of obstacles to win an epic day with a native Fijian. The winning tribe would learn the ins and outs of living off the land in Fiji ‚Äì a crucial reward to win in this game! The second tribe would also win a reward, not quite a day with a native Fijian ‚Äì¬†but a big ol‚Äô fish instead. Still good, just not as epic. The challenge itself involved each tribe racing through a series of physically draining obstacles. So draining, in fact, one tribe member, in particular, couldn‚Äôt even finish the first leg of the course. Heather on the Luvu tribe couldn‚Äôt complete her task early on in this challenge. Even though she was struggling, she didn‚Äôt give up ‚Äì and that itself was impressive. Her tribe thought the same and immediately rooted her on even though she eventually let the tribe down. This resulted in the Ua tribe winning the main reward, followed by the Yase tribe winning the fish dinner.   This is what real sportsmanship looks like. ü•∫  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/NfDRNYpTsu   ‚Äî SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 14, 2021 Ua Tribe  Before the Reward Challenge, Genie came back from the last Tribal Council completely shocked that her closest ally, Brad, was voted out. She was pissed. Genie then tells her tribe how she feels betrayed. While sharing how she feels like ‚Äúthe mom‚Äù of the tribe and has constantly fed them all, she finally says she‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù with preparing and providing their food‚Ä¶ But then, the reward came. The Fijian, Nathan, who visited their camp, gave them all sorts of necessary survival skills to live off the land of Fiji. Watching this guy on TV was nuts¬†‚Äì climbing trees like Spiderman, and showing how he‚Äôs clearly an expert at his craft. All this knowledge the tribe gained got Ricard thinking‚Ä¶ maybe they don‚Äôt need Genie taking care of them after all?   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Yase Tribe  The Yase tribe is on a roll with winning! After starting the season on an embarrassing losing streak, the solid four are proving they have what it takes to get far. After reflecting on how they‚Äôve struggled, they realize there‚Äôs now, literally and metaphorically, a reward after it all. While enjoying their big fish, they even see their metaphor in the flesh.   Gotta love an animal metaphor. Yase = Sea Turtles. üê¢üí™üèΩ  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/NzjjysQSCK   ‚Äî SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 14, 2021 The tribe compared themselves to the tiny baby sea turtles they saw pushing through the sand at their camp. I mean, it couldn‚Äôt possibly be¬† Survivor ¬†without a few metaphors, can it?! Luvu Tribe  Meanwhile, the Luvu tribe is unbeatable. This tribe still has yet to go to Tribal Council! After being six castaways strong, now at Day 8, things are finally beginning to crack‚Ä¶ Erika, who we don‚Äôt even know yet this season, gets some much-needed screentime. She explains her approach to the game and even says she‚Äôs a ‚Äúlion dressed as a lamb.‚Äù She‚Äôs ready to pounce and get this game started. Her first prey is Sydney. Erika wants to get her out because she thinks she is emotionally unstable, which could potentially cause trouble later in the game. Erika shares this plan with her closest ally, Deshawn. Now, as Deshawn‚Äôs listening to this master plan of hers, he starts to get a little apprehensive about Erika herself. He even calls her ‚Äúsus.‚Äù He thinks she‚Äôs playing hard ‚Äì because she is. He‚Äôs nervous about her sneakiness, and he now wants to cut the ‚Äúhead off the snake‚Äù (or should I say lion?) and get her out next instead. While trying to come up with a plan to vote Erika out, Deshawn approaches Danny with a scenario we‚Äôve all seen before in the game of¬† Survivor¬† ‚Äì throwing the Immunity Challenge. Yep. Deshawn is ready to throw it. He proposes to Danny how purposely losing could work in their favor because Erika is too sneaky and needs to be gone asap. Being an ex-NFL player, Danny feels like¬†this is all against his values of athleticism, but he decides to entertain the idea and get on with throwing this next Immunity Challenge anyway. READ MORE:  Survivor‚Äôs Brad Reese Says He Could Have ‚ÄòOutran That Monster‚Äô With A Few More Power Ups Immunity Challenge  Immunity is up for grabs! The first two tribes who finish their exhausting water-based obstacles win Immunity and are safe from Tribal Council. The three tribes began in the ocean and had to make their way to shore while untying bags of logs on the way. As always, these challenges are tough. But, let‚Äôs not forget how Deshawn and Danny want to milk every exhausting moment, as they‚Äôre trying to lose on purpose. While the rest of Luvu was pushing hard through the water, Deshawn was taking his sweet time. Meanwhile, as they compete against the Ua and Yase tribe, they notice that Yase is still slower than them! It was pretty comical. Deshawn narrated this Immunity Challenge explaining how he took every moment he could to throw it, yet the Yase tribe was still falling behind. It wasn‚Äôt until the last leg of the challenge where each tribe was even with one another (yes, Yase finally caught up). To finish this challenge, each tribe had to toss three rings onto their pegs. While Deshawn was terribly throwing his rings while (terribly) throwing the challenge, it was Naseer who stepped in. Naseer simply didn‚Äôt want to see his tribe lose for the first time. And, in the end, it didn‚Äôt matter that Deshawn and Danny were moving slow. That‚Äôs because Naseer won it for them! After the Yase tribe made a sweet victory of coming in first, (surprisingly?!) it was between Luvu and Ua for second place. JD on the Ua tribe failed to complete the last obstacle and lost it for his tribe.   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Tribal Council  With only four people left on the Ua tribe, at this point, Genie is certain she‚Äôs the next one to go. She even teases the fact that she‚Äôs ready to give the new¬† Survivor ¬†‚Äúshot in the dark‚Äù twist a-go. The shot in the dark would allow her to risk her vote but have a one-in-four shot at gaining Immunity at Tribal Council. The question for her was, does she want to risk losing her vote? Meanwhile, Shan is still running the show on this tribe. She‚Äôs playing her cards well. Ricard, her closest ally, has proven he will vote with her as long as he‚Äôs in this game. JD, though, has been questionable. Last week, he kept a vital secret from her as she eventually caught him in the lie. JD kept his ‚Äúsecret vote‚Äù advantage from her and Ricard, which has left her skeptical about him since. Now JD knows their trust in him is somewhat broken. Even though he‚Äôs teasing Genie that he‚Äôd work with her, JD knows he owes both Shan and Ricard his loyalty. So much so, Shan feels like this is the perfect opportunity to manipulate him. She knows how to play this game ‚Äì and to be quite frank,¬† Survivo r is all about backstabbing and being manipulative to get ahead. And, it was just that. Shan put on an act to JD. She acts ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù and tells JD she‚Äôs afraid he will vote against her. JD, who‚Äôs young, and I suppose, a bit naive in this case, then solidifies his trust (once again) and gives her his extra-vote advantage to hold! He did this once, and now he does it again! But this time, his risk did not pay off. JD was completely blindsided as Genie, as well as both Shan and Ricard, voted him out. And now, Shan is sitting with his advantage in her pocket!   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Wow. Even though we didn‚Äôt see too many game-changing twists in this episode, this week was just as wild, with an even wilder and unexpected Tribal Council!

But many parents want to know when exactly the money will be deposited. Last month‚Äôs checks started arriving the morning of September 15 for those with direct deposit, or soon after for those who received it through the mail. This month‚Äôs payment will be sent on Friday, October 15. Advance payments will continue next month and the following month, thanks to the American Rescue Plan passed back in March. While another stimulus check seems unlikely at this point, Democratic lawmakers are looking to extend the advance Child Tax Credit through 2025. Families can use the Child Tax Credit money however they like. That means the extra $250 or $300 per child can be put toward essentials like food or rent. It may also be spent on school supplies or a new computer, should COVID push students back into remote learning. Other households may apply the money toward piano lessons, daycare or even diapers. Regardless, the money comes at a time when much of the other pandemic aid ‚Äî¬† most recently the extra unemployment insurance ‚Äî has ended. Knowing that additional income is coming allows for a measure of security and flexibility in a world that‚Äôs full of surprises. How Much Should Your Check Be? READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The IRS is paying $3,600 total per child to parents of children up to five years of age. That drops to $3,000 for each child ages six through 17. Half of the total is being paid as six monthly payments and half as a 2021 tax credit. So each month through December parents of a younger child are receiving $300, and parents of an older child are receiving $250. The IRS has also made a one-time payment of $500 for dependents age 18 or full-time college students up through age 24.   DYK, foster parents, grandparents or other relatives may be eligible to receive advance  #ChildTaxCredit  payments? Read this  #IRSTaxTip :  https://t.co/9J5HB58rqX   #IRS   pic.twitter.com/831CpGNTfx   ‚Äî IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 14, 2021 The updated Child Tax Credit is based on parents‚Äô modified adjusted gross income (AGI), as reflected on their 2020 tax filing. (AGI is the sum of one‚Äôs wages, interest, dividends, alimony, retirement distributions and other sources of income minus certain deductions, such as student loan interest, alimony payments and retirement contributions.) The amount  phases out  at a rate of $50 for every $1,000 of annual income beyond $75,000 for an individual and beyond $150,000 for a married couple. The benefit is fully refundable, meaning it does not depend on the recipient‚Äôs current tax burden. Qualifying families receive the full amount, regardless of what they owe in taxes. There is no limit to the number of dependents that can be claimed. For example, suppose a married couple has a three-year-old child and a seven-year-old child and showed an annual joint income of $120,000 on their 2020 taxes. The IRS is sending them $550 per month. That‚Äôs $300 per month ($3,600 / 12) for the younger child and $250 per month ($3,000 / 12) for the older child. Those payments will last through December. The couple would then receive the $3,300 balance ‚Äî $1,800 ($300 X 6) for the younger child and $1,500 ($250 X 6) for the older child ‚Äî as part of their 2021 tax refund. Parents of a child who ages out of an age bracket are paid the lesser amount. That means if a five-year-old turns six in 2021, the parents will receive a total credit of $3,000 for the year, not $3,600. Likewise, if a 17-year-old turns 18 in 2021, the parents are receiving $500, not $3,000. An income increase in 2021 to an amount above the $75,000 ($150,000) threshold could lower a household‚Äôs Child Tax Credit. The IRS has confirmed that they‚Äôll soon allow claimants to adjust their income and custodial information online, thus lowering their payments. Failure to do so could increase one‚Äôs tax bill or reduce one‚Äôs tax refund once 2021 taxes are filed. Eligibility requires that the dependent be a part of the household for at least half of the year and be at least half supported by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who makes above $95,000 ($170,000) ‚Äî where the Credit phases out entirely ‚Äî will not be eligible for the expanded credit. But they can still claim the existing $2,000 credit per child. How Do You Make Changes For Future Payments? The IRS has three different tools to help recipients and potential recipients update their information on file, register and check eligibility. Child Tax Credit Update Portal READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The  Child Tax Credit Update Portal  allows users to make sure they are registered to receive advance payments. It also lets  recipients unenroll  from advance payments in favor of a one-time credit when filing their 2021 taxes. The deadline for the next payment was October 4. (Subsequent opt-out deadlines for future payments will occur three days before the first Thursday of the month from which a person is opting out.) Here are the remaining opt-out deadlines:   Payment Date: November 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 1   Payment Date: December 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 29   The tool also allows users to add or modify bank account information for direct deposit, view their payment history, and update their mailing address. Other features coming to the portal include changing one‚Äôs income and dependents. To access this portal, users need an IRS username or an ID.me account. ID.me is a sign-in service used by various government agencies, including the IRS, Social Security Administration and Treasury Department, to authenticate users. Users need valid photo identification to create an account.   An  #IRS  tool now enables families to quickly and easily unenroll from receiving monthly payments of the  #ChildTaxCredit , if they so choose.  https://t.co/Qt9TAuwjvv   pic.twitter.com/JNrVfKUkvt   ‚Äî IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 12, 2021 Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool The  Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool  is to help parents of children born before 2021 who don‚Äôt typically file taxes but qualify for advance Child Tax Credit payments. That means parents who have not filed their 2020 taxes, are not required to file, and don‚Äôt plan to file. (Parents who claimed their dependents on their 2019 tax return should not use this tool.) Users enter their personal information, including their name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, relevant social security numbers, bank account information, and identity protection PIN. The IRS uses the information to check eligibility and, once confirmed, will begin making payments. The IRS and experts advise using the tool on a desktop or laptop computer rather than a mobile device. Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant The  Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant  lets parents check if they are eligible to receive advance Child Tax Credit payments. Users will need a copy of their 2020 tax return or, barring that, their 2019 tax return. It‚Äôs also fine to estimate income and expenses from the appropriate tax year, though the result may not be accurate. The assistant asks multiple questions to determine eligibility, but does not ask for sensitive information. No entries are recorded.

The agency convened its experts Thursday and Friday to weigh-in on who should get boosters and when for people that received the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots earlier this year. The FDA will use its advisers‚Äô recommendations in making final decisions for boosters from both companies. Assuming a positive decision, there‚Äôs still another hurdle: Next week, a panel convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will offer more specifics on who should get one. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP‚Äôs earlier story follows below. U.S. health advisers are debating if millions of Americans who received Moderna vaccinations should get a booster shot ‚Äî this time, using half the original dose. Already millions who got their initial Pfizer shots at least six months ago are getting a booster of that brand. Thursday, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration evaluated the evidence that Moderna boosters should be offered, too ‚Äî and on Friday, they‚Äôll tackle the same question for those who got Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs vaccine. U.S. officials stress that the priority is to get shots to the 66 million unvaccinated Americans who are eligible for immunization ‚Äî those most at risk as the extra-contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has burned across the country. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to remember that the vaccines still provide strong protection against serious outcomes‚Äù such as hospitalization and death from COVID-19, said FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks. But Marks said it‚Äôs also become clear there is some waning of protection against milder infections with all three of the coronavirus vaccines used in the U.S. And he encouraged the advisory panel to consider if the evidence backs similar booster recommendations for all of them as well, since that would ‚Äúcreate the least confusion‚Äù for the public. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Moderna is seeking FDA clearance for a booster used just like Pfizer‚Äôs: For people 65 and older, or adults with other health problems, jobs or living situations that put them at increased risk of serious coronavirus ‚Äî once they are at least six months past their last dose. The FDA will use its advisers‚Äô recommendations in deciding whether to authorize Moderna boosters. If it does, there‚Äôs still another hurdle: Next week, a panel convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will offer more specifics on who should get one. What‚Äôs the evidence that the Moderna vaccine‚Äôs protection is waning? As the delta variant surged in July and August, people who were more recently vaccinated had a 36% lower rate of ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù infections compared with those vaccinated longer ago, Moderna‚Äôs Dr. Jacqueline Miller told FDA‚Äôs advisers. As for the dose, initial Moderna vaccination consists of two 100-microgram shots. But Moderna says a single 50-microgram shot should be enough for a booster. The company said that would trigger fewer uncomfortable shot reactions such as fever and achiness while also leaving more vaccine available for the global supply. A study of 344 people found the booster shot six months after initial vaccinations restored virus-fighting antibodies to levels seen after recipients‚Äô last dose ‚Äî and that included large jumps in antibodies able to target the delta variant, Miller said. One very rare side effect of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines is heart inflammation, particularly among young men soon after the second dose ‚Äî and one lingering question is whether another dose could spark more cases. Moderna‚Äôs booster study wasn‚Äôt large enough to spot such a rare risk. But Israel began offering Pfizer boosters sooner than the U.S. and to more of its population. Thursday, Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis of Israel‚Äôs health ministry told the FDA panel that after 3.7 million booster doses administered, there‚Äôs no sign the extra shot is any riskier ‚Äî despite an intense investigation into heart inflammation. In the U.S., scientists are divided about exactly who needs boosters and their purpose ‚Äî whether they‚Äôre needed mostly for people at risk of severe disease or whether they should be used to try to reduce milder infections, too. While Pfizer‚Äôs boosters are only for certain high-risk groups of Americans, Israeli officials credit wider booster use in their country to stemming the delta surge. ‚ÄúThere is no question in my mind that the break of the curve was due to the booster dose,‚Äù Alroy-Preis said in response to FDA advisers who noted that other countries have seen a lowering of delta cases without widespread booster use. As Thursday‚Äôs deliberations began, FDA‚Äôs advisers highlighted one confusing issue: People with severely weakened immune systems already can get a third full dose of the Moderna vaccine soon after the initial vaccinations ‚Äî so a question is whether they should be eligible for a booster, too, which would be their fourth dose.

That‚Äôs why companies are working around the clock to recruit new drivers, offering incentives like better pay, scholarships, and targeting the younger population. ‚ÄúI think now more than ever, the resilience and integrity of the supply chain really need to be preserved if we want to protect our economic, the way of life,‚Äù said Campion. As container ships continue to sit outside the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, CA, here at the Port of Baltimore, officials said they‚Äôre not experiencing any supply chain congestion issues. ‚ÄúThe Port of Baltimore is not experiencing supply chain congestion issues that are impacting other ports.

(AP) ‚Äî  A white man serving  a life sentence  for stabbing a Black college student to death at a bus stop at the University of Maryland has asked the state‚Äôs second highest court to throw out his murder conviction. WTOP-FM reports that Sean Urbanski‚Äôs attorneys argue that the trial judge shouldn‚Äôt have allowed jurors to see or hear about racist memes that investigators found on Urbanski‚Äôs phone after he killed Lt. Richard Collins III in May 2017. On Tuesday, they asked the Court of Special Appeals to order a new trial. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Prince George‚Äôs County prosecutors claimed the killing was a racially motivated hate crime. Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Hill Jr. dismissed a hate crime charge against Urbanski before a jury convicted him of first-degree murder in December 2019. But the judge said he believed both race and alcohol were factors in the killing. The judge allowed prosecutors to present evidence that Urbanski saved at least six photographs of racist memes on his cellphone and liked a Facebook group called ‚ÄúAlt-Reich: Nation.‚Äù Urbanski‚Äôs lawyers said prosecutors presented no evidence that their client ever made racist statements or held racist views. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúRather, the State maintained that because (Urbanski) had racist memes on his phone, and because he assaulted a Black man, it followed that he had a racist motive and intent on the night of this crime,‚Äù defense attorneys wrote. Prosecutors had sought the maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, though Urbanski will be eligible for parole under the judge‚Äôs sentence. Collins was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army shortly before his death. He was days from graduating from Bowie State University, a historically Black college, and was celebrating with a friend at bars on the night of his killing. Urbanski had been enrolled at the University of Maryland‚Äôs College Park campus. He, too, was drinking with friends at bars before the killing.

Her involvement is the latest sign that Democrats are pulling out the stops in the upcoming elections, particularly in Virginia, where Democrat Terry McAuliffe appears to be in a tighter race than expected. Jill Biden will be followed by other high-profile party voices in the coming days, including former President Barack Obama and¬†Stacey Abrams, the former 2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate who has risen to national prominence. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The return to the campaign trail will be Jill Biden‚Äôs first since stumping for her husband in last year‚Äôs presidential campaign. However, she has regularly traveled the country to promote such issues as improving public education and community college, reopening schools amid the pandemic and urging people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. That includes visiting reliably red states like Kansas, where she met with Hispanic community leaders on Tuesday. The state hasn‚Äôt backed a Democrat for president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. She‚Äôs due at a Friday afternoon early voting rally at Middlesex College in Edison, New Jersey, where Democratic incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy is thought to be comfortably ahead. She will later attend an event in suburban Richmond, Virginia‚Äôs capital, alongside McAuliffe, a former governor who is running to regain the post. In New Jersey, Murphy has sought to tie his Republican opponent, ex-state Assembly member¬†Jack Ciattarelli, to former President Donald Trump‚Äôs hesitancy about the COVID vaccine and mask-wearing, as well as lies about last year‚Äôs presidential election being stolen by widespread fraud. The first lady‚Äôs visit will be even more watched nationally in Virginia, though, where McAuliffe, a longtime Democratic Party powerbroker and friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, is squaring off with former businessman and political newcomer, Republican¬†Glenn Youngkin. Tammy R. Vigil, a professor of media science at Boston University, said first ladies have routinely traveled to boost their party‚Äôs leading candidates since Laura Bush ‚Äî who like many presidential spouses often had higher approval ratings than her husband ‚Äî began frequently campaigning for key Republicans during midterms and other races. ‚ÄúYou get a lot more emotional bang for the buck,‚Äù said Vigil, author of a 2019 book on Melania Trump and Michelle Obama which details how a ‚Äúnew era‚Äù of first ladies have expanded their political influence. ‚ÄúYou get the positivity of her favorability compared to her husband. You get her being able to talk about issues in different kinds of ways than an elected official might be able to. And you get a lot of that relatability factor.‚Äù Jill Biden holds a doctorate in English and has¬†continued to teach¬†writing and English at Northern Virginia Community College where she‚Äôs held a position since 2009 ‚Äî the first first lady to leave the White House to log hours at a full-time job. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall McAuliffe says that the president, who carried Virginia by a comfortable 10 percentage points last year, will also be campaigning for him in coming days. In the meantime, President Biden‚Äôs approval ratings¬†have fallen¬†to some of the lowest levels of his White House tenure. ‚ÄúThe president of course wants former Gov. McAuliffe to be the future governor of Virginia,‚Äù said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. But she also appeared to be attempting to lower expectations about whether what happens in Virginia next month could be an indicator of national Democratic struggles heading into next year‚Äôs midterm elections ‚Äî when the party‚Äôs narrow control of both chambers of Congress is at stake. ‚ÄúI will leave it to other outside analysts to convey that off-year elections are often not a bellwether,‚Äù Psaki said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do everything we can to help former Gov. McAuliffe.‚Äù McAuliffe is counting on women, especially those in the suburbs where Republican candidates saw their support¬†wane¬†during the Trump administration. Vigil said that is precisely ‚Äúthe constituency you bring the first lady in for.‚Äù ‚ÄúTheir whole persona is often built on the idea of connecting with constituents. Especially female constituents,‚Äù she said, calling the dynamic ‚Äúannoying to me that that‚Äôs the case because these first ladies are political actors and citizens in and of themselves, and yet they get pushed into this narrow corner of, ‚ÄôOh, the woman vote.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúIt does make sense,‚Äù Vigil added ‚Äúit‚Äôs just kind of uncomfortable in the modern era to have that be so limited.‚Äù The first lady‚Äôs travels come as the president is set to spend his Friday in Connecticut promoting a¬†massive spending plan¬†that Democrats are trying to muscle through Congress despite deep divisions within their own ranks over the final price tag. As both candidate and president, he has introduced himself at some events as ‚ÄúJill‚Äôs husband,‚Äù which draws frequent laughs and applause.

With Sunday‚Äôs thrashing of the New York Giants, the Cowboys have won four straight and extended their division lead. Now 4-1, they will travel to Foxborough this weekend to face the struggling New England Patriots. The Patriots also improved their record to 2-3, though in decidedly less impressive fashion. Rookie quarterback Mac Jones‚Äô late touchdown pass to Hunter Henry tied things up with the Houston Texans. He followed that up with an 85-yard drive that ended in a last-minute Nick Folk field goal for the win. The Patriots‚Äô win helps them keep pace with the AFC East-leading Buffalo Bills. And Jones‚Äôs growth and leadership has Patriots and their faithful  singing his praises . His bloody jersey toward the end of the game was tough to miss. That the Patriots didn‚Äôt show up in the first half and needed to  come from behind  on the hapless Texans is concerning though. The win felt almost like a loss. It‚Äôs pretty far from almost beating Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the week prior. READ MORE:  Bengals Visit Ravens With AFC North Lead On The Line Jones came out of Sunday‚Äôs win with decent enough stats. He went 22-30 for 231 yards, a touchdown and an interception. The interception was bad. But those stats would of improved some had Jakobi Meyers not dropped an easy 35-yard pass just before halftime. Henry was his top receiver, hauling in six passes for 75 yards. The running game chipped in 126 yards among the many who registered at least one carry, though Damien Harris did fumble away the ball at the goal line. Overall, this might be considered even more of a success, given their patchwork offensive line, which featured four backups in the starting lineup. ‚ÄúI would say that if I look at Mac Jones, or any of the rookie quarterbacks, it hasn‚Äôt been a strong season,‚Äù said NFL On CBS analyst Adam Archuleta. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not quite the Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert show that we saw last year. And I think that it shows that rookies have a really hard time adjusting to the NFL. But I think it also shows is that you can‚Äôt judge them on just a few games. You really can‚Äôt even judge them in their first year.‚Äù While the offense showed some bright spots, the defense allowed Texans backup Davis Mills to look like a legitimate starter. The unit had most of its key personnel, except cornerback Jalen Mills. Yet the Texans did as they wished for the first half of the game. The Patriots allowed scores on the Texans‚Äô first three drives. Mills ended the day 21-29 for a career-high 312 yards, three TDs, and no interceptions. His passer rating was 141.7. Chris Moore, fresh from the practice squad, caught all five of his targets for a career-high 109 yards. But linebacker Matthew Judon did sack Mills twice to stall one first-half drive. And the Patriots defense did shut down the Texans offense for most of the second half, allowing Jones to execute a comeback. The Cowboys offense presents a much stiffer challenge for the Patriots‚Äô defense than the Texans‚Äô. ‚ÄúIt will be interesting with no  Stephon Gilmore ,‚Äù said Archuleta. (The Pats recently traded cornerback and 2019 NFL Defensive Player of the Year.) ‚ÄúThat kind of changes the dynamic a little bit in the secondary. But it comes down to we‚Äôve got to knock out the run and can we hold up? Who is going to win at the catch point in one-on-one matchup against the receivers? And I think it‚Äôs really that simple. READ MORE:  'Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!' On The Big Screen At M&T Bank Stadium Tonight The Dallas offense is averaging 34 points per games, second only to the Buffalo Bills. Dak Prescott, who missed much of last season and was limited in preseason, is playing at the top of his game. His 1,368 yards and 13 touchdowns to date put him among the NFL‚Äôs top-10 QBs. CeeDee Lamb and Amari Cooper remain dangerous and productive wideouts. And running back Ezekiel Elliot, who started off the season a little slow, is coming off his second consecutive 100-yard game. He already has 452 yards and five TDs on the ground this season. Backup Tony Pollard is averaging 6.4 yards per carry. The Cowboys defense, considered a weakness coming into the season, is doing enough to keep opposing offenses off the scoreboard. They give up plenty of yards, especially in the passing game. Their 311 passing yards allowed is second worst in the league. But they also find a way to force turnovers. According to Archuleta, ‚ÄúTakeaways do so much for you, not only gives your offense extra possessions, but also just takes the numbers off of your top-line total yards and everything because you essentially end to drive. The season that Trevon Diggs is having, to be able to take the football away, that is huge. So many defenses who cannot take the ball away, they let the drive extend, and they can‚Äôt get off the field. Then the offense gets more chances and then they wear down. You have an offense right now ‚Äî the way Dak‚Äôs playing, and the way the running game is playing, and they‚Äôre operating ‚Äî that to me is really where it all starts.‚Äù The Cowboys offense will look to put up a lot of points. And their defense will look to force Jones and the Patriots offense into mistakes and turnovers. Can New England keep up? ‚ÄúOn paper, the way the Cowboys are playing, you would say not,‚Äù said Archuleta. ‚ÄúBut I think anything can happen. It just seems that just as teams start to get hot and it seems like they can‚Äôt be stopped, somebody comes in and plays a really good game against them. We‚Äôre approaching that midpoint of the year. So I still think anything can happen. But certainly the Cowboys right now are playing at a level that, offensively, they seem to be very, very difficult to stop. But I wouldn‚Äôt put it past the Patriots. I still think that they have a chance to put together a pretty good game plan, keep it close and figure out a way to come out on top. It‚Äôs not gonna be easy, but I do think it‚Äôs possible.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Turgeon Still Hoping For Long Postseason Run At Maryland The Cowboys play the Patriots Sunday, October 17 @ 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS.

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. As of Thursday, hospitalizations decreased by 23 to 729. Of those hospitalized, 547 remain in acute care and 175 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 548,743 total confirmed cases and 10,450 deaths. There are 3,955,454 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,163,980 doses. Of those, 4,011,006 are first doses with 5,569 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,647,982 second doses, 5,850 in the last day. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan of the 8 million milestone mark. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 307,472 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 439 in the last day. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 197,520 additional or booster vaccine doses, 8,522 in the last day. The state reported 84.9% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 25,476 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, October 13. Less than 0.71% of fully vaccinated Marylanders have later tested positive. Of those cases, 1,842 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 10.8% of all COVID cases hospitalized in the state. 233 fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed COVID deaths in the state.

CBS‚Äôs Norm Elrod talked to CBS Sports‚Äô Houston Nutt about the matchups. Auburn @ #17 Arkansas: October 16, 12:00 p.m. ET on CBS READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Seventeenth-ranked Arkansas has lost two straight. They gave up 52 points to Mississippi and were shut out by Georgia the week before. Can they turn things around against Auburn? ‚ÄúThey can, they can. They‚Äôre at home. It‚Äôs a home-field advantage. If you notice the way they played at home, especially against Texas, I think that‚Äôs going to be a big help getting back home. And saying that, I think the running game. Coach Pittman, I think he‚Äôll be going ahead with that. I think KJ Jefferson is really playing better. When you look at the job that they did, really the offensive game plan on the road at Ole Miss was pretty good. They had their chances. They have to do a better job of stopping the run. So to me, in this game, it‚Äôs going to come down to who can stop the run. And when you look at Tank Bigsby, when you look at Hunter, they‚Äôre good backs too. I think Arkansas has an excellent chance at home. And they know what this game means. This is a very, very important game.‚Äù #11 Kentucky @ #1 Georgia: October 16, 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS Top-ranked Georgia has been rolling over teams all season. This week they face 11th-ranked Kentucky, who are also undefeated. Will the streak continue? Does Kentucky have any chance at an upset? ‚ÄúKentucky has a chance. I think it‚Äôs a slim chance, because Georgia is so good. They‚Äôre so good on defense. They‚Äôre playing at home. You know what the 90,000 [fans] does. I‚Äôm thinking of the home field, when that home field participates. And the fan base at Georgia, they participate. Arkansas will tell you, they had three or four illegal procedures right when they opened the game, and they‚Äôre not the only team that had that problem. So, the defense of Georgia is so good. What I‚Äôm so excited about in this game, especially being on CBS, is Kentucky. Mark Stoops, you can‚Äôt say enough good things about what Mark Stoops has done with the program. He‚Äôs developed it, in that they‚Äôre physical, they‚Äôre tough. Rodriguez is a excellent running back. They‚Äôre physical, they‚Äôll try to get him the ball. I really think, because of the way they play, that‚Äôs why I give them a chance, because the ball bounces funny. I would have never said last week ‚Äî if you and I had this conversation about Texas A&M and Alabama ‚Äî I would have never said to you Texas A&M has a good chance to win against Alabama. I didn‚Äôt believe that. And then you go and look at Saturday night, look what happened on the field. Unbelievable advantage with the home-field crowd, and it‚Äôs a totally different team. And so you never know about football. But the thing about Kentucky, this is the first time they‚Äôve been undefeated since when Bear Bryant. So there‚Äôs a lot of confidence there. They‚Äôll be excited. But they‚Äôre going into a very hostile environment, and they‚Äôre going against the defense they haven‚Äôt seen before. I think it will be good. I think it will be a good football game. I think it‚Äôs going to be close. But I think, at the end, Georgia will win.‚Äù #24 San Diego State @ San Jose State: October 15, 10:30 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Everybody in the Mountain West is gunning for San Diego State, ranked 24th. Can San Jose State stay with them? ‚ÄúI think they can. Again, this game is so funny this year, but you just never know what can happen. The thing about it, they have to do a great job of stopping the run. In San Diego State, we know what the blueprint is. The blueprint is they‚Äôre going to be very physical, hand the ball to Bell over and over and then play-action, boots and waggles and all those things. So San Jose State really has to buckle up both chinstraps and do a great job on the defensive side. But saying all that, they‚Äôve found ways to score. They‚Äôve found ways to win.

Utah State has shown they can put up points on occasion. But Boise St. also held them to a field goal a few weeks back. Returning from a week off, will the winless UNLV provide any sort of challenge? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have much confidence there. And I know how tough it is when you‚Äôre trying to get going. When you don‚Äôt win, it creates some doubts. So it takes a great coaching job to keep those guys up and keep going. I think Utah State will win this game. This is the dose of medicine that Utah State needs, because they‚Äôve been inconsistent. And I‚Äôm sure Coach is going to really harp this week about being consistent. Let‚Äôs don‚Äôt have foolish penalties. Let‚Äôs take care of the ball. Because when we do those things, we can score. So that‚Äôs going to be the emphasis there, and I just think Utah State will win it.‚Äù Hawaii @ Nevada: October 16, 10:30 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network Hawaii was also idle last week.

The actual time the check arrives depends on the payment method and individual banks. Many parents with direct deposit set up through the IRS had already received their money Friday morning. That amounted to roughly  60 million children  overall the last time around. The remainder of families receiving their credits via direct deposit should have their money by the end of the day. Mailed checks could take up to a week, given various issues with the U.S. postal system. Future payments will continue to happen monthly through the end of the year, thanks to the American Rescue Plan passed back in March. Democratic lawmakers are looking to extend that end date to at least 2025. Families can use the Child Tax Credit money however they like. That means the extra $250 or $300 per child can be put toward essentials like food or rent. U.S. Census numbers collected in its Household Pulse Survey showed a sharp drop in  food insufficiency  and less difficulty with household expenses soon after the first payment arrived back in July. Almost half of recipients spent at least some of the money on food, and almost a fifth of parents with young children spent money on childcare. The credit may also be used to buy a new computer, which was a necessity during remote learning. Other households may apply the money toward piano lessons, car repairs, or even diapers. Regardless, knowing that the extra income will be there every month allows for a measure of security and flexibility in a world that‚Äôs full of surprises. How Much Should Your Check Be? READ MORE:  Fourth Stimulus Check: Will Another Relief Payment Happen This Year? The IRS is paying $3,600 total per child to parents of children up to five years of age. That drops to $3,000 for each child ages six through 17. Half of the total is being paid as six monthly payments and half as a 2021 tax credit. So parents of a child under six receive $300 per month, and parents of a child six or over receive $250 per month. The IRS has made a one-time payment of $500 for a dependent age 18 or full-time college student up through age 24.   There have been changes to the Child Tax Credit for 2021 and the credit amounts will increase for many taxpayers. Learn more from  #IRS  at  https://t.co/535gR8FJvp   pic.twitter.com/BgyZN36D4v   ‚Äî IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 13, 2021 The updated Child Tax Credit is based on parents‚Äô modified adjusted gross income (AGI), as reflected on their 2020 tax filing. (AGI is the sum of one‚Äôs wages, interest, dividends, alimony, retirement distributions and other sources of income minus certain deductions, such as student loan interest, alimony payments and retirement contributions.) The amount phases out at a rate of $50 for every $1,000 of annual income beyond $75,000 for an individual and beyond $150,000 for a married couple. The benefit is fully refundable, meaning it does not depend on the recipient‚Äôs current tax burden. Qualifying families receive the full amount, regardless of what they owe in taxes. There is no limit to the number of dependents that can be claimed. For example, suppose a married couple has a three-year-old child and a seven-year-old child and showed an annual joint income of $120,000 on their 2020 taxes. The IRS is sending them $550 per month. That‚Äôs $300 per month ($3,600 / 12) for the younger child and $250 per month ($3,000 / 12) for the older child. Those payments will last through December. The couple would then receive the $3,300 balance ‚Äî $1,800 ($300 X 6) for the younger child and $1,500 ($250 X 6) for the older child ‚Äî as part of their 2021 tax refund. Parents of a child who ages out of an age bracket are paid the lesser amount. That means if a five-year-old turns six in 2021, the parents will receive a total credit of $3,000 for the year ($250 per month), not $3,600 ($300 per month). Likewise, if a 17-year-old turns 18 in 2021, the parents are receiving $500, not $3,000. An income increase in 2021 to an amount above the $75,000 ($150,000) threshold could lower a household‚Äôs Child Tax Credit. The IRS will soon allow claimants to adjust their income and custodial information online, thus lowering their payments. Failure to do so could increase one‚Äôs tax bill or reduce one‚Äôs tax refund once 2021 taxes are filed. Eligibility requires that the dependent be a part of the household for at least half of the year and be at least half supported by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who makes above $95,000 ($170,000) ‚Äî where the Credit phases out entirely ‚Äî will  not be eligible  for the expanded credit. But they can still claim the existing $2,000 credit per child. How Do You Make Changes For Future Payments? The IRS has three different tools to help recipients and potential recipients update their information on file, register and check eligibility. READ MORE:  Child Tax Credit: How To Opt Out Of Monthly Payments Child Tax Credit Update Portal The  Child Tax Credit Update Portal  allows users to make sure they are registered to receive advance payments. It also lets  recipients unenroll  from advance payments in favor of a one-time credit when filing their 2021 taxes. The deadline for the next payment was October 4. (Subsequent opt-out deadlines for future payments will occur three days before the first Thursday of the month from which a person is opting out.) Here are the remaining opt-out deadlines:   Payment Date: November 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 1   Payment Date: December 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 29   The tool also allows users to add or modify bank account information for direct deposit, view their payment history, and update their mailing address. Other features coming to the portal include changing one‚Äôs income and dependents. To access this portal, users need an IRS username or an ID.me account. ID.me is a sign-in service used by various government agencies, including the IRS, Social Security Administration and Treasury Department, to authenticate users. Users need valid photo identification to create an account.   An  #IRS  tool allows families to verify their eligibility for  #ChildTaxCredit  payments and gives them the option to unenroll from the advance monthly payments.  https://t.co/Qt9TAuwjvv   pic.twitter.com/Ih8BnTjBAV   ‚Äî IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 14, 2021 Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool The  Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool  is to help parents of children born before 2021 who don‚Äôt typically file taxes but qualify for advance Child Tax Credit payments. That means parents who have not filed their 2020 taxes, are not required to file, and don‚Äôt plan to file. (Parents who claimed their dependents on their 2019 tax return should not use this tool.) Users enter their personal information, including their name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, relevant social security numbers, bank account information, and identity protection PIN. The IRS uses the information to check eligibility and, once confirmed, will begin making payments. The IRS and experts advise using the tool on a desktop or laptop computer rather than a mobile device.

(AP)  ‚Äî Baltimore coach John Harbaugh was asked recently to rank the pulsating finishes these past few weeks that have put his team atop the AFC North. ‚ÄúThe next one is going to be the best one,‚Äù Harbaugh said with a laugh. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The Ravens might very well be headed to another stressful fourth quarter, because up next for them Sunday is a clash with the Los Angeles Chargers. This matchup pits two of the most exciting quarterbacks in the sport in Lamar Jackson and Justin Herbert. It‚Äôs also a game between teams that have been tested in close contests‚Äìand have come through often enough to lead their divisions. Baltimore (4-1) lost its first game of the season in overtime, then beat Kansas City with the help of a late fumble and edged Detroit on Justin Tucker‚Äôs 66-yard field goal. The Ravens rallied from a 19-point deficit Monday night to beat Indianapolis in overtime. Los Angeles (4-1) is coming off a 47-42 win over Cleveland in which Chargers trailed 3-0, 10-7, 27-13, 35-28 and 42-35. A couple weeks earlier, the Chargers beat the Chiefs on a last-minute touchdown. ‚ÄúIt shows us that we have the belief to win any type of game,‚Äù Los Angeles cornerback Chris Harris said. ‚ÄúAny type of way that teams want to play, we feel like we can play any style. If they want to pound and ground, we can play that type of game and still win a shootout. If it‚Äôs a close, tight-knit defensive game, we feel like we can win those games, too.‚Äù Herbert threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns against Cleveland. Jackson‚Äôs stat line against the Colts was similar: 442 yards passing and four TDs. Neither quarterback was intercepted. Jackson is passing more this year, and the Ravens lead the NFL in total offense. He‚Äôs still a running threat as well. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably the most dynamic player in the NFL when he gets the ball in his hands,‚Äù Chargers linebacker Joey Bosa said. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to need to stop.‚Äù Harbaugh has plenty of admiration for Herbert as well. ‚ÄúHe throws the second-fastest football in the National Football League based on what I saw in the data. So, he has tremendous arm strength,‚Äù Harbaugh said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen him throw in person yet. This will be a first for me, personally. I‚Äôm looking forward to it. ‚ÄúKind of. Sort of. I guess.‚Äù EKELER‚ÄôS EMERGENCE Austin Ekeler is tied for the league lead with seven touchdowns and helped fuel the Chargers‚Äô rally last week against Cleveland with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter. ‚ÄúWhat you can do is activate him in the passing game and in the running game to give you an advantage depending on how people are playing you,‚Äù coach Brandon Staley said. ‚ÄúAgainst a rush that‚Äôs that good, you have to find your backs for some breathers back there when the pocket‚Äôs chaos.‚Äù READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Ekeler, who is fifth in the AFC with 349 yards rushing, hasn‚Äôt been stopped for negative yards or no gain in his last 37 carries. TOP TARGETS The Ravens lost receiver Sammy Watkins during the game against Indianapolis to a hamstring injury. That meant tight end Mark Andrews and receiver Marquise Brown were clearly the top options for Jackson to look for. Those two combined for 21 catches, 272 yards and all four Baltimore TDs. STOPPING THE RUN The Chargers come into Sunday‚Äôs game last in the league in run defense, giving up 157.6 yards per game. ‚ÄúWe have a high level of missed tackles with the yards after contact,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something we need to clean up.‚Äù The Ravens, who lost running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards to injuries before the season, were held under 100 yards rushing by the Colts ‚Äî the first time in 44 games Baltimore failed to reach triple digits. KEEP AN EYE ON ‚Ä¶ Chargers kicker Tristan Vizcaino leads the league with four missed extra points, including two last week against Cleveland. ‚ÄúI feel like‚Äìwe feel like‚Äìthis guy‚Äôs a good player,‚Äù Staley said. ‚ÄúWe have to keep coaching him, stay patient with him. Because sometimes it‚Äôs what guys like this need, patience, and a little bit more experience.‚Äù The Ravens benefitted from mistakes by Indianapolis‚Äô kicking game Monday. The Colts missed an extra point, as well as a field goal that would have won the game. Baltimore also blocked a field goal. DAYLIGHT Baltimore returns to a more normal schedule now after playing three of its first five games at night. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really excited about it, actually, to get in that 1 o‚Äôclock rhythm,‚Äù defensive coordinator Don Martindale said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you all felt on Tuesday, but I know how I felt.

The Kansas City Chiefs coming off back-to-back Super Bowl appearances are currently sitting at the bottom of the division at 2-3, with the Los Angeles Chargers riding high at 4-1. The Las Vegas Raiders and Denver Broncos sit in a two-way tie at 3-2. It‚Äôs been the Patrick Mahomes show since #15 took over the starting job in Kansas City, but second-year signal caller Justin Herbert is the one grabbing headlines this season, despite fairly similar stats. Mahomes comes into week 6 with 1,490 passing yards/16 touchdowns/6 picks while Herbert has racked up 1,576 passing yards/13 touchdowns/3 picks. READ MORE:  Bengals Visit Ravens With AFC North Lead On The Line The Raiders and Broncos square off this week with each looking to move two games above .500. Mahomes and the Chiefs will hit the road to take on the Washington Football Team, and the Bolts are headed for a heavyweight match up with the AFC North division-leading Baltimore Ravens. SportsLine ‚Äòs  Larry Hartstein  breaks down AFC West matchups in Week 6. All times listed are Eastern. Kansas City Chiefs @ Washington Football Team, Sunday, October 17, 1:00 p.m. Kansas City looks to rebound after an 18-point loss to the Buffalo Bills at Arrowhead last weekend. The Washington Football Team is also coming off a home loss, as they fell to the New Orleans Saints, 33-22. These two teams have had two common opponents so far, the Chargers and Bills, going a combined 0-4. If you put stock into this sort of thing, although the Chiefs‚Äô losses to Buffalo and Los Angeles were by a combined 20 points while Washington‚Äôs losses were by a combined 26 points, seemingly giving KC the edge in a head-to-head comparison. As for Larry Hartstein‚Äôs opinion heading into this one he says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to a touchdown now. The money has been coming in on the Chiefs, despite the fact that Patrick Mahomes has thrown six interceptions already, the last three games. This defense giving up 7.1 yards per play. That is historically bad. Last year the Lions and Jacksonville were the two worst defenses, only 6.3 yards per play; almost a full yard worse. Hopefully Chris Jones will be back to help that defense. But I just think the Chiefs aren‚Äôt as bad as they‚Äôve looked. Look at who they‚Äôve played ‚Äî Buffalo, Cleveland, the Chargers, the Ravens. Those are the four best teams in the AFC. So it‚Äôs been a gauntlet. When they did play an NFC East team, Philadelphia, we all remember what they did, winning 42 to 30. I think this is a similar spot where they don‚Äôt have to force things as much against this Washington defense, which is bad. I do expect the Chiefs to put up a big number and cover. But at a touchdown it‚Äôs not as great of a play as it was at six or six and a half.‚Äù Los Angeles Chargers @ Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, October 17, 1:00 p.m. READ MORE:  'Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!' On The Big Screen At M&T Bank Stadium Tonight This contest will feature two critically acclaimed QBs who are playing as good as anyone in the league right now. Lamar Jackson won the MVP in 2019, and he is on pace to have an even better season in a few key stats this year. Herbert is coming off a record-breaking ROY campaign and is also on pace to beat his award-winning numbers. Here‚Äôs what Hartstein has to say about this match-up between 4-1 division leaders. ‚ÄúThis is going to be a great game. If you follow me on SportsLine, I jumped on this early. Chargers plus three and a half. I didn‚Äôt think three and a half would last, and now it‚Äôs down to three. The Ravens had to go to overtime last week, and this is a short week for them coming off an emotional win. It‚Äôs going to be a great game, I feel this game is going to come down to the wire. You look at the Chargers, and they tend to play very close games. I like the value at three and a half. At three, I don‚Äôt love it as much. But I can‚Äôt wait to watch it, because you have two legitimate MVP candidates in Justin Herbert and Lamar Jackson.‚Äù Las Vegas Raiders @ Denver Broncos, Sunday, October 17, 4:25 p.m. For our final AFC West matchup, Hartstein is leaning towards the black and silver. ‚ÄúA lot of people are thinking that the Raiders will be in disarray because Jon Gruden was the play-caller and the offensive mind. I think last week they were distracted by the controversy, they were listless. They basically didn‚Äôt show up at home against the Bears. I cannot imagine them playing worse, now that that cloud is lifted. Rich Bisaccia, the interim coach, is very well respected. He has interviewed for some head-coaching jobs around the league, and I think the Raiders will be focused. This line has ticked up. The Broncos were at three, now they‚Äôre laying three and a half. I just think everyone‚Äôs expecting the Raiders to lie down and get steamrolled, but I don‚Äôt see it. I think this number feels about right.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Turgeon Still Hoping For Long Postseason Run At Maryland So what NFL picks can you make with confidence?

The three-judge panel determined the document could not be classified as a personnel record which might be exempt from public records requests because the Baltimore City State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office does not have the ability to hire, fire or directly discipline Baltimore City Police officers. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The court also ruled the list does not get an exemption for ‚Äúattorney work-product,‚Äù because such documents are prepared for a specific trial. Additionally, the court found Mosby‚Äôs office‚Äôs refusal to waive $18,000 in fees to for two public records requests was ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious.‚Äù Following news of the ruling, Mosby released a statement saying she planned to release the list ‚Äúin short order,‚Äù but did not specify a timeline. ‚ÄúWe were told by the Attorney General‚Äôs Office earlier this year that we were legally prohibited from releasing our Do Not Call list,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have always been clear about my desire to release this list, and this ruling and the recent MPIA law change, which I advocated for, gives us the authority to release the list.‚Äù A representative from Attorney General Brian Frosh‚Äôs office challenged that characterization, saying Mosby could have released the list at any point and chose not to. ‚ÄúIt was the State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office‚Äôs decision initially to withhold the information,‚Äù said spokesperson Raquel Coombs. ‚ÄúSubsequently, our office offered legal advice that the State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office was within its rights to do so.‚Äù READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Mosby first disclosed  there were 305 Baltimore police officers  on the ‚Äúdo-not-call list‚Äù in December 2019 during testimony before the Maryland Commission To Restore Trust In Policing, a state group tasked with investigating the the Baltimore Police Department‚Äôs¬† Gun Trace Task Force . Officers on the list are not necessarily excluded from testifying, Mosby said, but her office would ‚Äúprovide automatic disclosure‚Äù to defense attorneys when these officers are involved in cases. A smaller number of officers on the list are excluded from providing testimony, she said. Baltimore Action Legal Team, a nonprofit group of activist lawyers, filed a Maryland Public Information Act request for the ‚Äúnames, ranks, badge numbers, job assignments, and dates of hire of the individual officers‚Äù on the list on Dec. 6, 2019, according to appeals court ruling. In January 2020, Mosby‚Äôs office denied the request, saying it met the ‚Äúpersonnel record‚Äù exemption. Baltimore Action Legal Team filed subsequent public records requests for investigations into the criminal conduct of police officers during the 2019 calendar year and any cases that had been open for more than 16 months, and for the files on any ‚Äúdirected at potential  or alleged criminal conduct‚Äù of one particular officer. Mosby‚Äôs office said it would cost $15,000 for attorneys and clerks to assemble the records to process the first request, and an additional $3,000 for the second. Baltimore Action Legal Team asked for the fees to be waived, citing the public interest in the information, but did not receive a response.

The affidavit further alleges the only time the agents saw Rich use a wheelchair was in connection with his medical appointments, particularly five between March 2019 and February 2021. The agents reported seeing Rich load the wheelchair into the trunk of his car before or after a VA medical appointment, using the wheelchair at the appointments or wheeling himself to his car, then loading the wheelchair into the car.

(WJZ) ‚Äî  Lashing out at the ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù movement, Gov. Larry Hogan on Friday announced that Maryland will invest an additional $150 million in law enforcement as part of his ‚Äúre-fund the police‚Äù initiative. Hogan said efforts to reduce police funding, inadequate resources and criticism of police, combined with surging violent crime, have made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to recruit and keep qualified police officers. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Instead of diverting police funding to other avenues, the governor said, public officials need to steer more funding to law enforcement to maintain public safety. ‚ÄúThinking that you can improve law enforcement by defunding the police is like saying that you want to improve education by defunding the schools,‚Äù Hogan said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absurd and ridiculous.‚Äù Efforts to ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù have grown in popularity nationwide amid unrest in the wake of high-profile police killings of civilians, such as George Floyd. But the name is a misnomer since it means reducing police funding and spending more on programs to address root causes, not eliminating police budgets. Hogan said now‚Äôs the worst time to consider cutting law enforcement funding, saying violent crime afflicting major cities nationwide is driving away recruits and leading officers on the force to quit or retire early. ‚ÄòWe Need More Investment‚Äô The key to improving public safety is not defunding police, the governor said, but rather beefing up police budgets. ‚ÄúTo reverse the tide of rising crime, we need to stop demonizing and sabotaging the dedicated men and women who risk their lives every single day to keep the rest of us safe. Enough is enough. We cannot defund the police. We need to re-fund the police. Instead of less funding, we need more investment in public safety,‚Äù he said. That‚Äôs why, Hogan said, he plans to spend $150 million to shore up law enforcement funding. The governor‚Äôs plan includes:   $50 million for police pay raises and bonuses;   $45 million to help local agencies with recruitment;   $24 million to fund body cameras and de-escalation training;   $14 million would cover victims‚Äô services and resources;   $10 million would pay for neighborhood safety grants;   $6 million for domestic violence and human trafficking victims;   $1 million for the Maryland Chiefs and Sheriffs Association.   ‚ÄúOur $150 million ‚Äòre-fund the police‚Äô initiative will provide a desperately needed shot in the arm to our state and local police agencies and their critical efforts to stop crime,‚Äù Hogan said. ‚ÄòBaltimore Is A Poster Child‚Äô Singling out Baltimore during Friday‚Äôs news conference, Hogan took digs at city officials and said the city‚Äôs violent crime problem is ‚Äúout of control.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on pace to surpass 300 homicides again this year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Baltimore Police Department is short-staffed by more than 300 officers. The city of Baltimore is a poster child for the basic failure to stop lawlessness. There‚Äôs a prosecutor who refuses to prosecute crime. And there‚Äôs a revolving door of repeat offenders who are being let right back onto the streets to shoot people again and again.‚Äù READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Left unsaid during Hogan‚Äôs remarks was that the Baltimore Police Department‚Äôs budget rose by $28 million this year. Figures provided by the police department show he is not wrong about the violent crime rate. The city has seen 265 homicides so far, compared to 262 for the same time last year. There have been 572 non-deadly shootings, down from last year‚Äôs total (586). Though the governor referred to State‚Äôs Attorney Marilyn Mosby and City Councilman Ryan Dorsey, he did not mention either of them by name. Neither could be reached for comment Friday. City & State Leaders React Mayor Brandon Scott pushed back against the governor‚Äôs comments, saying confronting the city‚Äôs violent crime problem requires collaboration among leaders, ‚Äúnot tactless finger pointing.‚Äù Over the last three months, Scott said, the police department has recovered over 550 crime guns and cleared over 220 violent crimes, including murders and shootings. ‚ÄúSimply dispensing money will not solve anything unless that investment is met with real leadership, accountability and the willingness to make tough decisions,‚Äù the mayor said. Baltimore City Councilman Kristerfer Burnett told WJZ tackling violent crime isn‚Äôt a matter of adding police, it‚Äôs also about investing in programs that keep people from falling into a cycle of crime. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often not necessarily because we need more officers,‚Äù Burnett said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often economic issues that people are facing, addiction issues that people are facing, housing insecurity ‚Äî I mean, there‚Äôs any number of issues that we could be investing hundreds of millions of dollars into.‚Äù Legislative leaders also weighed in, with House Speaker Adrienne Jones accusing the governor of politicizing the issue and calling his remarks ‚Äúbeneath him and the dignity of his office.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe House stands ready to have an open an honest conversation about improving policing and reducing crime in the State once there are real ideas ‚Äî not rhetoric,‚Äù Jones said.

His arrest and the accusation that an active duty Capitol Police officer was trying to obstruct the investigation into the attack is particularly notable because many of his colleagues were brutally beaten in the insurrection. The riot left dozens of police officers bloodied and bruised as the crowd of pro-Trump rioters, some armed with pipes, bats and bear spray, charged into the Capitol, quickly overrunning the overwhelmed police force. One officer was beaten and shocked with a stun gun repeatedly until he had a heart attack; another was foaming at the mouth and screaming for help as rioters crushed him between two doors and bashed him in the head with his own weapon. More than 600 people face charges in the Jan. 6 attack, in which a mob loyal to then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, battled police and tried to stop the certification of the election victory for President Joe Biden. In the days after the attack,¬†scores of rioters flaunted their participation in social media posts that bragged about their ability to get inside the Capitol. But then many started realizing it could be used as evidence and began deleting it. An¬†Associated Press review of court records¬†has found that at least 49 defendants are accused of trying to erase incriminating photos, videos and texts from phones or social media accounts documenting their conduct as the pro-Trump mob stormed Congress and briefly interrupted the certification of Democrat Joe Biden‚Äôs election victory. Experts say the efforts to scrub the social media accounts reveal a desperate willingness to manipulate evidence once these people realized they were in hot water. They say it can serve as powerful proof of people‚Äôs consciousness of guilt and can make it harder to negotiate plea deals and seek leniency at sentencing. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Riley told the rioter that the scene was a ‚Äútotal s‚Äîshow.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you got out of there unscathed. We had over 50 officers hurt, some pretty bad,‚Äù the officer wrote, according to the complaint. When the rioter said through messaging that he didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd done anything wrong, Riley responded, according to court papers: ‚ÄúThe only thing I can see is if you went into the building and they have proof you will be charged. You could always articulate that you had nowhere to go, but that‚Äôs for court.‚Äù Later in January, after two had discussed their love of fishing, Riley told the man to get off social media. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre arresting dozens of people a day,‚Äù he wrote, according to the posting. ‚ÄúEveryone that was in the building. Engaged in violent acts or destruction of property and they‚Äôre all being charged federally with felonies.‚Äù Making digital content vanish isn‚Äôt as easy as deleting content from phones, removing social media posts or shutting down accounts. Investigators have been able to retrieve the digital content by requesting it from social media companies, even after accounts are shut down. Posts made on Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms are recoverable for a certain period of time, and authorities routinely ask those companies to preserve the records until they get court orders to view the posts. Despite initial criticism that Capitol police did not do enough to stop the rioters, Riley is the first Capitol police officer to be charged with a crime involving the insurrection. But several current and former police officers were arrested on riot-related charges, including two Virginia police officers who posed for a photo during the attack. In July, authorities arrested an off-duty Drug Enforcement Administration agent accused of posing for photographs in which he flashed his DEA badge and firearm outside the Capitol during the riot. Other law enforcement officers were investigated for their presence at the Capitol that day or at Trump‚Äôs rally before the riot. In January, an Associated Press survey of law enforcement agencies nationwide found that at least 31 officers in 12 states are being scrutinized by their supervisors for their behavior in the District of Columbia or face criminal charges for participating in the riot. In September, Capitol Police said officials¬†had recommended disciplinary action¬†in six cases after an internal review of officer behavior stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The department‚Äôs Office of Professional Responsibility had opened 38 internal investigations and was able to identify 26 of the officers involved, police said in a statement at the time. In 20 of the cases, no wrongdoing was found. It isn‚Äôt clear whether Riley was among the officers who were referred for disciplinary action. ___ Associated Press writers Jacques Billeaud in Phoneix and Michael Kunzelman in College Park, Md. contributed to this report.

In episode one of season five, ‚ÄúTrust But Verify: Part 1,‚Äù Jason Hayes (David Boreanaz) and Bravo Team underwent a training exercise that turns into a full-blown mission to smuggle a weapons expert out of hostile territory. CBS‚Äô Matt Weiss spoke to Boreanaz about Jason Hayes mental state, moving to  Paramount+  and what‚Äôs in store for viewers with ‚ÄúTrust But Verify: Part 2‚Äù coming up on Sunday night. READ MORE:  David Boreanaz On ‚ÄòSEAL Team‚Äôs Authenticity: ‚ÄòWe Do It In A Way That Is Very Detail Oriented, We Take Pride In That‚Äô MW-  Good to see you again David!  SEAL Team  season five, episode two comes out this Sunday but before we get into that I want to talk about the big switch to becoming a Paramount+ original. How much does this shift change the way you‚Äôre able to create the show? DB-  You know it‚Äôs interesting because the show to begin with is so intense, what we do on the network and how we push the envelope and the level of authenticity for it to begin with. Now with moving over to Paramount+ you really get the plus aspect of it. You get to see a little bit more, you get to invest in some deeper subject matters with the characters. That‚Äôs just the way it is today, streaming is the world and we are happy and proud to be part of that platform. Each  SEAL Team  episode is a thrill ride I say to speak. You get the speed and efficiency of missions and operations and you see the ins and outs of of how these guys operate with weapons and tactical maneuvers and breaching doors. All that stuff is great but you also get the other half which is the mental component. You have all these compelling characters and how they deal with what‚Äôs going on inside the wire AND outside the wire. I‚Äôve always found that that is really the pulse of the show. For my character, Jason Hayes, you see this leader who takes  SEAL Team  into battle but he‚Äôs also got to understand them outside the wire. That really resonates with me and so we‚Äôll see that intensify more on Paramount+. MW-  The show does such a great job of addressing the mental health challenges that these men and women face. That, of course, includes Jason Hayes. It seemed like at the end of season four he was turning a corner for the better but these things don‚Äôt just completely flip over night. Where is Jason at right now with those issues? DB-  Well, we‚Äôll see at the end of episode two, a moment where the TBI starts to creep back into his world. It‚Äôs a simple kind of test that he gives himself and it doesn‚Äôt work out too well for him. That starts a spiral for him. With the people in these situations it‚Äôs almost like they don‚Äôt want to address what‚Äôs going on. They want to continue to operate at full capacity and failure is not an option; even if they‚Äôre not operating a 100%. That‚Äôs a big struggle for Jason and that‚Äôs hard for him; that‚Äôs his life. It‚Äôs what he‚Äôs known to do and we‚Äôll see that unfold. At the end of episode two we have a sad moment which leads us into three which is the 9/11 episode. That mental health topic will continue with all the members throughout the season and in particular with Jason we will see him meet his father, he‚Äôll find the root of his trauma and in episode 12 he takes a big ayahuasca journey, which I‚Äôm really excited to do. When people think of ayahuasca they thing it‚Äôs just to drug out but it‚Äôs used today to help mental capacity and mental health. READ MORE:  ‚ÄòBlue Bloods‚Äô Vanessa Ray And Will Estes Discuss The ‚ÄòTremendous Responsibility‚Äô Of Playing Cops Organic Mushrooms, or whatever you may say, is now actually helping to battle depression and fight these mental distress problems. These men and women are suffering and we‚Äôll dive into that and that‚Äôs exciting for me to play this character and to do those types of things. The journey is going to lead him down to a path of finding the root of his trauma, trying to understand it and become a better person, a better leader overall. MW-  Episode one of season five was called ‚ÄúTrust Buy Verify: Part 1‚Äù and now episode two ‚ÄúTrust But Verify: Part 2.‚Äù That phrase really stuck out to me, is that going to be a theme for the whole season? DB-  Yeah, we always kick things off that way with the first episode setting the tone and I think that‚Äôs a really great thematic took. I think it helps the viewer saying this is what you have in store for the season. MW-  So what‚Äôs in store for part two on Sunday night? DB-  So this mission in North Korea is definitely different It‚Äôs not a capture/kill it‚Äôs a capture/save operation for Bravo team. What‚Äôs unique about that is the intensity is so high that we‚Äôre not going to be able to fire a single weapon. We‚Äôre not going to be going in there weapons blazing, we have to get in and out as fast as we can. Going back to the character development, we‚Äôll also see how TBI is going to play a very big role in this episode and onward for the rest of the season. MW-  Well I love the show so I‚Äôm excited to see how everything unfolds. Thank you for the time today and all the best David! DB-  Thanks Matt, take care!

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by 0.1% to 3.69%. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.96 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 38 to 691. Of those hospitalized, 514 remain in acute care and 177 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 549,679 total confirmed cases and 10,471 deaths. There are 3,960,647 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,183,809 doses. Of those, 4,016,087 are first doses with 5,081 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,652,957 second doses, 4,975 in the last day. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 306,694 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 316 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The state has administered 181,261 additional or booster vaccine doses, 9,957 in the last day. The state reported 84.7% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 25,476 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, October 13. Less than 0.71% of fully vaccinated Marylanders have later tested positive. Of those cases, 1,842 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 10.8% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. 233 fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The Florida father of six was unvaccinated and gravely ill as Covid-19 pneumonia ravaged both his lungs in August. ‚ÄúHe is in dire need of an¬† ECMO ¬†treatment, which is not available at the hospital that he is in,‚Äù his wife Susan Walker told CNN at the time. ECMO treatment uses an¬†external machine that can function as the body‚Äôs heart and lungs. It can be used for¬†organ transplant¬†patients, victims of ¬†severe heart attacks ¬†and seriously ill Covid-19 patients ‚Äî¬†including young adults. Family members¬†called 169 hospitals¬†in several states, but there was no ECMO availability for Robby. ‚ÄúAll the beds are taken up by Covid victims also getting ECMO treatment,‚Äù Susan said in a CNN interview. Then a doctor¬†in Connecticut saw Susan‚Äôs emotional interview¬†and decided to help. Now, after three weeks on ECMO and a month learning how to walk again, Robby returned to Florida this week ‚Äî with a new mission. ¬† A different life after Covid-19 ¬† Before Robby fell ill in July, he was a strong and sturdy construction business owner who worked out at the gym and ran 5 miles every day. ‚ÄúFifty-two years, I‚Äôve done pretty much whatever I wanted,‚Äù Robby told CNN. ‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôm very limited.‚Äù Scarred lungs and reduced lung capacity means he can only speak in short, choppy sentences before having to catch his breath. He also lost more than 50 pounds while hospitalized as his muscles eroded. Even brushing his teeth is now a struggle. ‚ÄúSitting in a chair, it‚Äôs probably a 5- or 6-minute ordeal,‚Äù Robby said. ‚ÄúIf I stand, then I have to take a break between. So it‚Äôs a little longer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt takes a lot more energy to hold yourself up. I can go from sitting in a chair to standing, and my heart rate will jump 20, 30 beats a minute.‚Äù After his ECMO treatment at Connecticut‚Äôs Saint Francis Hospital, Robby spent a month in physical therapy at Gaylord Speciality Healthcare about 30 miles away. He relearned how to walk and practiced basic self-care with the help of an assistant. But he still needs a walker to move around, and small tasks can be draining ‚Äî even after taking a break. ‚ÄúOnce your heart rate comes down and your breathing gets straight, you‚Äôre still just exhausted,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPhysically. It just takes a lot of energy to do.‚Äù But the fact he‚Äôs even alive is worth celebrating. ¬† ‚ÄòThey told me he was dying‚Äô ¬† Robby called his wife on July 25 from his hospital bed in Florida and told her he had made a gut-wrenching decision. ‚ÄúHe had signed the papers to be intubated,‚Äù Susan said. Some Covid-19 patients who get put on ventilators don‚Äôt survive the disease. Their final calls to their families before intubation are their last. ‚ÄúHe cried and just told me how regretful he was of not getting the shot,‚Äù Susan said. ‚ÄúAnd he begged me to go get vaccinated.‚Äù She did. But it was too late to protect her husband, whose condition kept deteriorating. ‚ÄúThey told me he was dying,‚Äù Susan said. And the ECMO treatment Robby needed wasn‚Äôt available. Susan told her story to CNN in August. Hours later, a doctor 1,200 miles away was checking his Facebook feed and saw a CNN post with a video clip of Susan‚Äôs interview. ‚ÄúI just clicked on it and watched it and ‚Ä¶ it was pretty compelling,‚Äù said Dr. Robert Gallagher, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Trinity Health of New England. Cardiothoracic surgeons operate on diseases in the chest, including in the heart and lungs. By the time Covid-19 patients reach Gallagher, they‚Äôre usually in dire condition ‚Äî and often in need of ECMO. He forwarded Susan‚Äôs interview to the chief¬† perfusionist , who runs the ECMO machines. And she immediately wanted to help. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòOK, how are we going to find this family?'‚Äù Angela Sakal, the chief perfusionist at Saint Francis Hospital in Connecticut, told CNN. She contacted a friend in Florida who‚Äôs savvy on social media. ‚ÄúAnd within a couple of hours, she had Susan‚Äôs phone number,‚Äù Sakal said. Within two days, Susan hired a medical evacuation team to fly Robby from Florida to Connecticut ‚Äî intubated, sedated and near death. When Sakal first saw Robby, she wasn‚Äôt sure he would survive. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt guarantee you an outcome,‚Äù she recalled telling Susan. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the future is going to be. But I can promise you that we‚Äôre going to do the best that we can for him.‚Äù ECMO is sometimes used as a last resort for critically ill Covid-19 patients with failing lungs. It removes blood from the body, eliminates carbon dioxide and adds oxygen to the blood, then pumps the blood back into the body so the lungs might have a chance to recover. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Gallagher inserted the ECMO tubes in Robby‚Äôs neck. And over the next 22 days, Sakal oversaw Robby‚Äôs ECMO treatment. ¬† Younger Covid-19 patients are needing ECMO ¬† Robby isn‚Äôt the only previously healthy Covid-19 patient Sakal has seen needing ECMO. With the rise of the Delta variant, Sakal said some ECMO patients have been in their 20s. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre finding is our Covid patients ‚Äî even the young ones ‚Äî are single organ failure (and) previously healthy,‚Äù Sakal said. ‚ÄúAnd the Covid is just destroying their lungs.‚Äù Not everyone who goes on ECMO survives. But after three weeks of getting his blood extracted and returned, Robby‚Äôs lungs had recovered enough to support him again. He was discharged from Saint Francis in mid-September and started a month of inpatient rehabilitation at Gaylord Specialty Healthcare. ‚ÄúMy lungs have gotten a little bit better, (but) my heart rate still races a little bit,‚Äù Robby said this week. ‚ÄúI can walk by myself ‚Äî somebody‚Äôs there just kind of making sure I‚Äôm staying straight. But I use a roller/walker, and I‚Äôm able to walk a decent distance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm not going to the mall or going shopping. But I‚Äôm able to walk some now. So it‚Äôs been a big improvement.‚Äù After a month of difficult work relearning basic skills, Robby was released from rehab Wednesday. Most of his ECMO team from Saint Francis Hospital traveled to Gaylord to see him off to Florida. Sakal was there. She fought back tears as she visited her former patient. ‚ÄúI remember when he first got here,‚Äù she said Wednesday. ‚ÄúAnd I watched him today, standing up and talking and walking. It was amazing. It was just awesome.‚Äù ¬† A new life filled with uncertainty and lessons learned ¬† Robby‚Äôs two brothers rented an RV and drove up to Connecticut to bring him and Susan home. The drive would take more than 24 hours. As he traveled back to Florida to restart his life, Robby said the first thing he wanted was his wife‚Äôs homemade chicken pot pie. But many other aspects of his former life will be different. It‚Äôs not clear when Robby might be able to go to work again, as he still needs months more of rehabilitation. The family also has no idea how much of the $1.5 million in medical bills racked up so far in Florida and Connecticut they will owe ‚Äî or how exactly they will pay it. A family friend set up¬† a GoFundMe account to help with Robby‚Äôs medical expenses . And Robby doesn‚Äôt know whether he‚Äôll be able to return to all the activities he loved. ‚ÄúMy goal is to get hopefully 80% or 90% to where I was,‚Äù he said. But ‚Äúthey just don‚Äôt know enough about this to give any kind of definitive answers.‚Äù For now, he won‚Äôt be able to go fishing or work out at the gym every day. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a lot of strength,‚Äù he said, joking about fishing: ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want anything to pull me over the reel.‚Äù But what he lacks in physical ability, he‚Äôs gained in new wisdom ‚Äî especially when it comes to Covid-19 and vaccines. Robby‚Äôs ordeal has inspired more than 100 friends, relatives and acquaintances to get vaccinated ‚Äî¬†including some who were extremely hesitant, Susan said. Robby said the reason he and Susan didn‚Äôt get vaccinated earlier was due to ‚Äúa lack of education on our part.‚Äù With countless rumors and claims spread on social media, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of that was ignorance on our part, for not doing more research.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe thought that the vaccine was something that was created in a year or two. So we felt like there wasn‚Äôt enough information,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut through this journey that I‚Äôve had, we‚Äôve discovered that (mRNA vaccine research)¬†has actually been around for 20-plus years.‚Äù He also wrongly assumed that he wouldn‚Äôt get severely sick. ‚ÄúI just thought it would be like a flu. I thought that it was something that affected people with underlying conditions. I had none,‚Äù Robby said. ‚ÄúBut for whatever reason, it affected me differently. And if I had to do it over again, I would have gotten my vaccination when it was available to me.‚Äù After he left the hospital, Robby received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He had some side effects for a day, he said, but they weren‚Äôt nearly as bad as his Covid-19 symptoms. ‚ÄúThere was a little fever ‚Ä¶ my first few days of Covid, I had a bigger fever than that,‚Äù Robby said. ‚ÄúI just had no energy. I did run a fever for probably a day, day and a half. But nothing horrible compared to everything else I‚Äôve gone through.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized The-CNN-Wire  ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by 0.25% to 3.44%. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.96 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 10 to 681. Of those hospitalized, 500 remain in acute care and 181 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 550,550 total confirmed cases and 10,476 deaths. There are 3,964,072 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,196,251 doses. Of those, 4,017,857 are first doses with 1,770 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,656,119 second doses, 3,162 in the last day. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 307,953 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 263 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 214,322 additional or booster vaccine doses, 7,247 in the last day. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The state reported 85.2% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 25,476 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, October 13. Less than 0.71% of fully vaccinated Marylanders have later tested positive. Of those cases, 1,842 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 10.8% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. 233 fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Bell‚Äôs 2-yard scoring run early in the second quarter put Baltimore up 14-0. Los Angeles punted on its first three possessions, then turned the ball over on downs. Then Herbert was intercepted for the first time since Week 2. He‚Äôd thrown 11 touchdown passes over the previous three games, while the Chargers totaled 105 points. Jackson threw an interception immediately after Herbert‚Äôs, and only then ‚Äî after taking over on the Baltimore 27 ‚Äî did the Chargers score. Herbert‚Äôs 1-yard touchdown pass to Jared Cook made it 17-6. The Ravens got the ball first in the second half, and after a long kickoff return, they went 52 yards in 12 plays, using up nearly half of the third quarter and going ahead 24-6 on Jackson‚Äôs 9-yard touchdown pass to Mark Andrews. The Ravens‚Äô methodical approach ‚Äî and the Chargers‚Äô difficulty stopping the run ‚Äî led to a significant gap in time of possession. Baltimore held the ball for just over 38 minutes.

Los Angeles went for it on fourth-and-3 from its own 39 in the second quarter, then on fourth-and-1 from its own 19 in the third. Herbert threw incomplete both times, leading to two Baltimore field goals. Freeman scored on a 9-yard run at the start of the fourth to make it 34-6. INJURIES Murray left in the third quarter with an ankle injury, and Ravens center Bradley Bozeman left with a back injury on the first drive of the second half. UP NEXT Chargers: Los Angeles has next weekend off before hosting New England on Oct. 31. The Chargers lost 45-0 to the Patriots last season. Ravens: Baltimore hosts Cincinnati next Sunday before its bye week.

But with so many Americans still unvaccinated, the numbers could still go back up, Dr. Anthony Fauci told Fox News Sunday. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt do very well in that regard, there‚Äôs always the danger that there will be enough circulating virus that you can have a stalling of the diminishing of the number of cases and when that happens, as we‚Äôve seen in the past with other waves that we‚Äôve been through, there‚Äôs the danger of resurgence,‚Äù said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, who appeared on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Although cases still remain high at an average of more than 85,000 infections a day, they are down by more than 8,000 from the weeks before, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University . And deaths are down an average of more than 200 a day from the start of the month. Progress in the numbers is still threatened, however, by the low rates of vaccination. As of Sunday, 57% of the total population was fully vaccinated against the virus, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  And though health experts do not know exactly what proportion of the population needs to be protected to control the spread of the virus, Fauci has said a vast majority will need to be vaccinated. The good news is, Fauci does not think another spike in cases is inevitable. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be within our capability to prevent that from happening,‚Äù said Fauci. ‚ÄúThe degree to which we continue to come down in that slope will depend on how well we do about getting more people vaccinated.‚Äù Johnson & Johnson boosters As more Covid-19 boosters are potentially set to become available, experts say those who received the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine are ‚Äúawfully well protected,‚Äù but should still get another shot for maximum safety. ‚ÄúThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine turns out not to be quite as effective as the Pfizer and Moderna. And people who got (the J&J vaccine) way back at the beginning of this year therefore have been somewhat less protected, although they‚Äôre still awfully well protected,‚Äù said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. Collins‚Äô remarks come after a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee  recommended  all adults who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot should get a second dose at least two months after their first dose. The FDA will consider the committee‚Äôs advice. Then the CDC‚Äôs vaccine advisers will be asked to consider it. Experts are  advising  people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should get a booster shot as soon as it is available because it will provide them with the best protection against Covid-19, especially as the more transmissible Delta variant continues to be the dominant strain in the United States. But they are also reinforcing the point the vaccine remains highly effective against the worst consequences of the virus. Johnson & Johnson has indicated its vaccine immunity has waned ‚Äî but not by much. Still, the company said studies show a booster dose increases protection equivalent to the 94% efficacy shown by the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines soon after they were first given in clinical trials last year. Meanwhile, various real-world studies suggest Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs vaccine was anywhere between 50% and 68% effective, Dr. Amanda Cohn with the CDC said Friday. ‚ÄúIf the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna had not been so utterly, amazingly effective, 95%, then Johnson & Johnson would look like a hero with their one dose, but I guess our standards are being set awfully high here by the other vaccines,‚Äù Collins told CNN. But a study  published Thursday  reported a steep decline in vaccine effectiveness against infection by August of this year, especially for people who received the J&J vaccine. Researchers found among more than 600,000 veterans, J&J‚Äôs vaccine‚Äôs protection against infection fell from 88% in March to 3% in August. Meanwhile, Moderna‚Äôs vaccine protection against infection fell to 64% from 92%, and Pfizer‚Äôs declined to 50% from 91% during the same time period. ‚ÄúThe performance of these vaccines against severe disease, keeping people out of the hospital, is distinctly better than that, and that‚Äôs the main thing we‚Äôre interested in,‚Äù said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. The FDA vaccine advisory committee  also supported  emergency use authorization for booster shots of Moderna‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine after six months, but not for everyone. Moderna recipients over the age of 65 and adults with conditions that put them at risk for severe disease or who work or live in a place which puts them at higher risk of complications or severe illness may be eligible for the 50-microgram booster, which is half the size of the primary two-dose series. And as for whether booster shots will become available for everyone who‚Äôs already vaccinated, health officials are still working to determine that. ‚ÄúI think as more data come in and ‚Ä¶ are carefully reviewed and vetted, then I think the expansion of the recommendations may be in order. Not quite yet,‚Äù Schaffner said. Minnesota Emergency and Urgent Care services suspended over nurses strike In many places, the brunt of the hospital strain from Covid-19 has fallen on nurses, and a strike in Minnesota has impacted services. Emergency and Urgent Care services have been temporarily suspended at Abbott Northwestern WestHealth in Plymouth, Minnesota due to about 50 nurses from the Minnesota Nurses Association (MNA) choosing to strike, according to a statement from Allina Health. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The nurses are striking to seek ‚Äúa contract that provides fair pay and benefits to nurses on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the MNA said in a statement on Thursday. ‚ÄúMNA nurses have been negotiating a new contract for months, but Allina has refused to agree to fair pay for holiday work or adequate benefits,‚Äù the MNA said in the statement. ‚ÄúCompensating nurses fairly for holiday work is especially critical because understaffing by Allina and other hospital systems has required nurses to work more days and longer hours, including overtime and holidays, as they continue on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.‚Äù The closure began Sunday morning and will last until 7:00 a.m. local time on Wednesday, according to the statement. ‚ÄúAllina Health and Abbott Northwestern WestHealth have negotiated 7 times with MNA. A contract settlement was previously reached and unanimously recommended by the union‚Äôs bargaining team. Unfortunately, the MNA could not finalize that agreement,‚Äù Allina Health‚Äôs statement says. ‚ÄúThroughout negotiations, we have consistently offered proposals that demonstrate our commitment to our employees, including an immediate wage increase to align wages with other metro hospitals and agreeing to some of the union‚Äôs other priority issues.‚Äù Black people represent a larger share of new vaccinations As public health officials talk boosters, 66 million Americans who are eligible for a vaccine still haven‚Äôt received their initial shots, while nearly 57% of the US population is fully vaccinated,  according to the CDC . Black and brown communities have proven to be disproportionally bearing the brunt of the pandemic for various reasons, including health care inequities. But there is some good news in terms of Black people‚Äôs vaccination numbers. Recently, Black people ‚Äî who comprise 12.4% of the total US population ‚Äî have come to represent a slightly larger share of new vaccinations than in the past, according to the CDC. Since vaccinations began, Black people in the US have accounted for 10.6% of all people with at least one dose. But in the past two weeks, they have accounted for 11.4% of new vaccinations. The growth in vaccinations comes after two studies  published by the CDC in April  showed racial and ethnic minority groups had higher rates of hospitalization for Covid-19 and sought emergency department care for Covid-19 more when compared to White people. Another analysis published earlier this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) showed the difference in Covid-19 cases and deaths between Black, Hispanic and White people is narrowing. KFF researchers found while disparities are still present across different racial groups, the gap is improving for Black and Hispanic people, based on an analysis of case and death data from CDC last month. But Covid-19 infections remain high in Native American and Alaska Native people. Some in law enforcement are resisting vaccine, but Covid-19 is killing more of them than gunfire Meanwhile, Covid-19 has become  the leading cause of death  for officers, despite law enforcement being among the first groups eligible to receive the vaccine at the end of 2020. As of Saturday, the total stood at 476 Covid-19 related deaths since the start of the pandemic, compared to 94 from gunfire in the same period. Still, law enforcement officers and their unions across the country  have resisted vaccine mandates , despite the Delta variant-fueled resurgence of Covid-19 and effectiveness of the shots in preventing severe cases and death. Reasons cited for the vaccine resistance among law enforcement officers range from disinformation to distrust in the science of the vaccines. In Chicago, the head of the police union asked officers not to follow the mayor‚Äôs order to submit Covid-19 vaccination proof by the Friday deadline. John Catanzara, the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police president, urged, in a video message posted on YouTube, for officers to stand their ground against the mandate. ‚ÄúI am telling you right now. It is an improper order. It is illegal ‚Ä¶ Refuse that order,‚Äù Catanzara said in the video. The city filed a complaint alleging the union was ‚Äúencouraging a work stoppage or strike.‚Äù A Cook County Circuit judge ruled Friday night Catanzara should not make public statements encouraging members to not comply with the vaccination policy. Catanzara ‚Äúhas never engaged in, supported, or encouraged a work stoppage,‚Äù according to a union statement on Friday. Lightfoot said the city would take the weekend to check with officers who have not complied with the mandate. She said officers should report for duty until they are told by supervisors they have been placed on leave.

The attack on Colonial Pipeline, which led to gas shortages along the East Coast, was attributed to a Russia-based gang of cybercriminals.

But the US could still prevent that spike with higher vaccination rates. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt do very well in that regard, there‚Äôs always the danger that there will be enough circulating virus that you can have a stalling of the diminishing of the number of cases, and when that happens, as we‚Äôve seen in the past with other waves that we‚Äôve been through, there‚Äôs the danger of resurgence,‚Äù Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday.‚Äù READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Although cases still remain high, with an average of about 85,000 new infections a day as of Sunday, they are down by more than 8,000 from a week prior, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University.  Deaths are down an average of more than 200 a day from the start of the month. Progress in the numbers is threatened, however, by the low rates of vaccination. As of Sunday, 57% of the total population was fully vaccinated against the virus, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And though health experts do not know exactly what proportion of the population needs to be protected to control the spread of the virus, Fauci has said a vast majority will need to be vaccinated. Fauci does not think another spike in cases is inevitable. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be within our capability to prevent that from happening,‚Äù said Fauci, who is also the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden. ‚ÄúThe degree to which we continue to come down in that slope will depend on how well we do about getting more people vaccinated.‚Äù Vaccine mandates counterproductive, governor says Health experts have pointed to vaccine mandates as a key tool to keeping cases down and relieving hospital strain, but some officials stand staunchly against the measures. Fauci has been a  proponent of mandates , saying the data shows that they work in getting more people vaccinated. And though it would be preferable to convince people to choose to get vaccinated, that is not always feasible, he said. ‚ÄúI think when you‚Äôre in a public health crisis, sometimes unusual situations require unusual actions,‚Äù Fauci told Fox News. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Sunday that he believes both federal and state mandates are counterproductive to increasing vaccination rates. Hutchinson told NBC News he believes muddled messaging at the highest levels of government has ‚Äúslowed down acceptance of the vaccine and increased resistance.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see us get to, without the mandate battle, let‚Äôs just encourage the vaccine acceptance, build confidence in it, and that‚Äôs the direction we need to go,‚Äù the governor said. Asked specifically about the success of  Tyson Foods  and  Walmart‚Äôs  vaccine mandates in the state of Arkansas, the governor said it is ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù proof mandates work. ‚ÄúSo yes, there is an effectiveness there. And so, let me make it clear that when I say I don‚Äôt believe we ought to be engaged in mandates, I‚Äôm speaking of the government mandates, whether it‚Äôs a federal government mandate or a state government mandate,‚Äù he said. Hutchinson pointed out that employers must navigate a nuanced, on-the-ground reality of some employees wanting a vaccine mandated work environment to feel safe while others do not. Hutchinson said, based on that predicament, the choice of whether to mandate should be left in the hands of employers. Gottlieb pushes for research into Delta variant type seen in UK READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said ‚Äúurgent research‚Äù is needed into a different version of the Delta variant of the coronavirus that has been seen in the UK, although there‚Äôs no evidence that it‚Äôs more transmissible. ‚ÄúThe variant has been in the UK since about July, but it has been slowly increasing in prevalence. There‚Äôs no clear indication that it‚Äôs considerably more transmissible, but we should work to more quickly characterize these and other new variants. We have the tools,‚Äù he wrote in a tweet on Sunday. ‚ÄúThis is not a cause for immediate concern but a reminder that we need robust systems to identify, characterize new variants,‚Äù he said. A report released by the UK Health Security Agency on Friday says in the week beginning September 27 ‚Äî the last full week with complete sequencing data ‚Äî this version accounted ‚Äúfor approximately 6% of all sequences generated, on an increasing trajectory.‚Äù Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have all been rising in the UK, where there are no countrywide mask mandates and few travel restrictions from other countries. Even with waivers, some paid thousands for Covid hospitalizations, study says Many insurers waived Covid-19 hospitalization costs in 2020, but those waivers didn‚Äôt cover everything and out-of-pocket expenses cost patients a lot more than other respiratory diseases, according to a new study. The study published Monday in JAMA Network Open found that out-of-pocket spending for Covid-19 hospitalization was about $4,000 on average for people with private insurance. For people with Medicare Advantage it was more than $1,500. Researchers looked at hospitalization records for more than 4,000 people in 2020 and found that this spending was about four times the average out-of-pocket cost for other respiratory infections in 2019. ‚ÄúThe findings suggest that out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations may be substantial if insurers allow cost-sharing waivers to expire,‚Äù the study said. Minnesota Emergency and Urgent Care services suspended over nurses strike In many places, the brunt of the hospital strain from Covid-19 has fallen on nurses, and a strike in Minnesota has impacted services. Emergency and Urgent Care services have been temporarily suspended at Abbott Northwestern WestHealth in Plymouth due to about 50 nurses from the Minnesota Nurses Association choosing to strike, according to a statement from Allina Health. The nurses are striking to seek ‚Äúa contract that provides fair pay and benefits to nurses on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the association said in a statement Thursday. ‚ÄúMNA nurses have been negotiating a new contract for months, but Allina has refused to agree to fair pay for holiday work or adequate benefits,‚Äù the MNA said in the statement. ‚ÄúCompensating nurses fairly for holiday work is especially critical because understaffing by Allina and other hospital systems has required nurses to work more days and longer hours, including overtime and holidays, as they continue on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.‚Äù The closure began Sunday morning and will last until 7 a.m. local time Wednesday, according to the statement. ‚ÄúAllina Health and Abbott Northwestern WestHealth have negotiated 7 times with MNA. A contract settlement was previously reached and unanimously recommended by the union‚Äôs bargaining team. Unfortunately, the MNA could not finalize that agreement,‚Äù Allina Health‚Äôs statement says. ‚ÄúThroughout negotiations, we have consistently offered proposals that demonstrate our commitment to our employees, including an immediate wage increase to align wages with other metro hospitals and agreeing to some of the union‚Äôs other priority issues.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized The-CNN-Wire  ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

In a federal lawsuit, Trump said the committee request was ‚Äúalmost limitless in scope,‚Äù and sought records with no reasonable connection to that day. He alleged the committee is seeking potentially millions of presidential records that he asserts are covered by a broad range of privileges, including those that cover presidential communications and conversations between lawyers and a client. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The committee‚Äôs request was a ‚Äúvexatious, illegal fishing expedition,‚Äù unprecedented in scope and ‚Äúuntethered from any legitimate legislative purpose,‚Äù the lawsuit said. The lawsuit takes aim at the core oversight functions of Congress, saying the records being sought by lawmakers are not for ‚Äúlegitimate legislative purposes‚Äù and the committee does not have the powers of a law enforcement agency. It seeks an injunction to bar the archivist from producing them. Biden has said he would not block the release to the committee, because the Jan. 6 attack was such an unprecedented event that executive privilege should not factor in. Lawmakers are seeking the documents as part of its investigation into how a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6 in an effort to halt the certification of Biden‚Äôs win. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The committee demanded a broad range of executive branch papers related to intelligence gathered before the attack, security preparations during and before the siege, the pro-Trump rallies held that day and Trump‚Äôs false claims that he won the election, among other matters. Trump‚Äôs lawsuit says the ‚Äúboundless requests included over fifty individual requests for documents and information, and mentioned more than thirty individuals, including those working inside and outside government.‚Äù The suit says the request could include ‚Äúconversations with (or about) foreign leaders, attorney work product, the most sensitive of national security secrets, along with any and all privileged communications among a pool of potentially hundreds of people.‚Äù The lawsuit was filed by Jesse Binnall, an attorney based in Alexandria, Virginia, who represented Trump in an unsuccessful lawsuit late last year seeking to overturn Biden‚Äôs victory in Nevada. Trump and his allies have continued to make baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.

There, they found a victim who told police his jacket and keys were stolen while he was inside the travel plaza. The victim notified police the suspect was the driver of a specific tractor-trailer. Police were advised of a tractor exiting the travel plaza on the wrong side. The vehicle was traveling south in the northbound lanes of I-95, driving against traffic.

Officials said after nearly three miles, the driver stopped on the fast shoulder in an active work zone where several highway workers were working. According to authorities, through an open passenger side window, the trooper made several verbal requests for the driver to shift the truck into park and hand over his keys. The driver instead accelerated into the northbound lanes of I-95, again traveling south against northbound traffic. As the driver continued to accelerate after failing to listen to commands, the trooper was thrown from the truck onto the highway.

(WJZ) ‚Äî  Everyone who works for the city of Baltimore must now provide proof they‚Äôve been vaccinated against COVID-19, or else they‚Äôll be required to undergo routine testing under a new city policy. The  COVID-19 vaccine mandate took effect Monday and covers all 14,000 city employees . READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School But after raising concerns about the policy‚Äôs implications, unions representing the city‚Äôs firefighters and  police officers are calling for the deadline to be pushed back  until they get answers to their lingering questions. ‚ÄúWe just want to know how they‚Äôre going to do this,‚Äù said Rich Langford, who serves as president of Baltimore Firefighters IAFF Local 734, a firefighters and paramedics union. The  policy was announced in late August by Mayor Brandon Scott . It calls for all city employees, including part-time staff and contractors, to prove they‚Äôre vaccinated or be subject to weekly testing. Since the policy was announced, Langford said, the union has tried unsuccessfully to get details about the mandate. He cited problems that have arisen from ‚Äúnot completely thought out‚Äù policy changes in the past. Specifically, he said, his union‚Äôs members want to know how testing for unvaccinated employees will be carried out ‚Äì and how it could affect the fire department‚Äôs ability to serve the community. ‚ÄúOne of the biggest things our members need to know is exactly how this testing is going to be implemented,‚Äù Langford told WJZ. ‚ÄúWe have no idea. We‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs going to be done on duty, but that also brings in a lot of logistical problems.‚Äù One potential problem, he said, could involve putting fire engines, fire trucks and rescue units out of service while their crews get tested for COVID-19. That‚Äôs a risk they‚Äôre not willing to overlook. Similar concerns have been raised by the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, which represents the city‚Äôs police. In a letter to members Friday, union president Mike Mancuso said attempts to discuss the policy with the city have been met with delays. As a result, Mancuso wrote, the union filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the Office of the Labor Commissioner. He said the union also filed court paperwork to keep the policy from being enforced until wrinkles are ironed out. ‚ÄúFOP3 believes that there are multiple collective bargaining issues that surround the city‚Äôs vaccination policy,‚Äù Mancuso wrote. ‚ÄúWe have made multiple attempts to sit down and discuss these issues to no avail.‚Äù READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall It‚Äôs because of those delays and the collective bargaining issues at stake that Mancuso  advised union members not to disclose their vaccination status to the city . ‚ÄúUntil the city responds to our right to bargain these issues, or the courts intervene, I suggest you do nothing in regard to revealing your vaccination status as it is outlined in the city‚Äôs policy,‚Äù the letter stated. At last check, figures provided by the Baltimore Police Department showed nearly two-thirds of its employees had gotten at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. That‚Äôs significantly lower than the general population. State health officials estimate 85 percent of adults in Maryland are at least partially vaccinated. The mayor‚Äôs communications director, Cal Harris, released a statement Monday saying the city met with police union officials Friday to discuss their concerns about the mandate. ‚ÄúLabor Commissioner Deborah Moore-Carter led a productive meeting Friday afternoon with the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police and their attorney, Commissioner Michael Harrison, and representatives from the City‚Äôs Law Department and Human Resources to discuss concerns over the vaccination mandate. We will remain in close contact with the FOP until a solution is reached, and we are hopeful it will,‚Äù Harris said. In response to questions from WJZ about the details of the testing policy, Harris‚Äô deputy, Stefanie Mavronis, said details will be released later this week. Mavronis said the testing plan will be based on what the data shows, specifically ‚Äúwho is unvaccinated and where they work.‚Äù Some city residents said they believe the mandate is a good idea. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs great,‚Äù said Duane Dennis. ‚ÄúI think the safer we can be, the better we are.‚Äù Added Brian Holmes: ‚ÄúThey said, ‚ÄòDo it,‚Äô so I did it.

The President has spent months delivering speeches across the country trying to sell the public on his infrastructure plans. And this week, Biden is meeting with lawmakers to negotiate both aspects of his infrastructure proposals ‚Äî a sweeping economic package to expand the social safety net and a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. On Thursday, the day Biden takes part in the town hall, Vice President Kamala Harris will be campaigning for gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe in neighboring Virginia, a source familiar with Harris‚Äô event told CNN. The long slog of congressional negotiations is expected to loom over the upcoming November elections, which are just weeks away.

A CNN Poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month found that support for an economic bill that enacts all the proposed social safety net and climate change policies is broadest among liberal Democrats (84%), but two-thirds of moderates and conservatives in the party share that view (67%). In that same poll, Americans were divided over the President‚Äôs approval rating.

His national popularity soared in the aftermath of the US-led coalition victory during the Gulf War, and for a time in the mid-90s, he was considered a leading contender to become the first Black President of the United States. But his reputation would be forever stained when, as George W. Bush‚Äôs first secretary of state, he pushed faulty intelligence before the United Nations to advocate for the Iraq War, which he would later call a ‚Äúblot‚Äù on his record. Though he never mounted a White House bid, when Powell was sworn in as Bush‚Äôs secretary of state in 2001, he became the highest-ranking Black public official to date in the country, standing fourth in the presidential line of succession. ‚ÄúI think it shows to the world what is possible in this country,‚Äù Powell  said  of his history-making nomination during his Senate confirmation hearing. ‚ÄúIt shows to the world that: Follow our model, and over a period of time from our beginning, if you believe in the values that espouse, you can see things as miraculous as me sitting before you to receive your approval.‚Äù Later in his public life, he would grow disillusioned with the Republican Party‚Äôs rightward lurch and would use his political capital to help elect Democrats to the White House, most notably Barack Obama, the first Black president whom Powell endorsed in the final weeks of the 2008 campaign. The announcement was seen as a significant boost for Obama‚Äôs candidacy due to Powell‚Äôs widespread popular appeal and stature as one of the  most prominent and successful Black Americans  in public life. Powell is survived by his wife, Alma Vivian (Johnson) Powell, whom he married in 1962, as well as three children. Professional soldier Colin Luther Powell was born April 5, 1937, in Harlem, New York, to Jamaican immigrants. After growing up in the South Bronx, Powell attended school at the City College of New York, where he participated in ROTC, leading the precision drill team and attaining the top rank offered by the corps, cadet colonel. ‚ÄúI liked the structure and the discipline of the military,‚Äù Powell said, according to  a CNN profile of him in the early 2000s . ‚ÄúI felt somewhat distinctive wearing a uniform. I hadn‚Äôt been distinctive in much else.‚Äù He entered the US Army after graduating in 1958, and later served two tours in South Vietnam during the 1960s, where he was wounded twice, including during a helicopter crash in which he rescued two soldiers. He stayed in the Army after returning home, attending the National War College and rising in leadership. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1979, appointed as Reagan‚Äôs final national security adviser in 1987 and was tapped by the elder Bush in 1989 to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell‚Äôs tenure in the elder Bush‚Äôs administration was marked by his involvement in some of the most notable American military actions of the late 20th century, including the 1989 Panama operation, the 1991 Gulf War and the US humanitarian intervention in Somalia, though he  retired  from the Army days before the disastrous  Battle of Mogadishu . Although Powell was initially reluctant to commit US troops when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, he became one of the administration‚Äôs most trusted spokesmen when the assault on Saddam Hussein‚Äôs army finally came. ‚ÄúFirst we‚Äôre going to cut it off. Then we‚Äôre going to kill it,‚Äù Powell famously said at a news conference at the time, referring to the Iraqi army. Following the assault, Powell became something of a  national hero , enjoying a 71% favorability rating in the first few year years after the war. His efforts during the war also earned him two prominent awards: a Congressional Gold Medal in March 1991 ‚Äúin recognition of his exemplary performance in planning and coordinating‚Äù the US response to Iraq‚Äôs invasion, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. As the elder Bush presented Powell with the award at a White House ceremony in 1991, he said the general‚Äôs ‚Äúdeep compassion for every one of the thousands of men and women under (his) command will always be remembered.‚Äù During Powell‚Äôs time in the military, which lasted until 1993, he also received a number of other notable awards, including the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. He received his fourth star in 1989, becoming the second African American to rise to that rank. In addition to the military awards, Powell also received the President‚Äôs Citizens Medal, the Secretary of State Distinguished Service Medal, and the Secretary of Energy Distinguished Service Medal, as well as a second Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded with distinction, from President Bill Clinton. Top diplomat during turbulent time With a prominent national profile, Powell was floated as a potential presidential candidate in the 1996 election. But in a highly anticipated decision, he declined to participate in the race, citing a lack of ‚Äúpassion‚Äù for electoral politics. ‚ÄúSuch a life requires a calling that I do not yet hear,‚Äù he  told reporters in 1995 . ‚ÄúAnd for me to pretend otherwise would not be honest to myself, it would not be honest to the American people.‚Äù Powell was again encouraged to run in the 2000 presidential election, but rebuffed calls for him to mount a bid. He instead endorsed George W. Bush, delivering a  speech  at the Republican National Convention in which he argued that the then-governor of Texas would ‚Äúhelp bridge our racial divides.‚Äù He was Bush‚Äôs  first Cabinet selection  when he was announced as the 43rd President‚Äôs nomination for secretary of state, and with his  expertise  in foreign policy and widespread popularity, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall He shared Bush‚Äôs reluctance to project military strength across the globe, a view that was quickly displaced by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As Bush‚Äôs top diplomat, he was tasked with building international support for the War on Terror, including the Afghanistan War, but it was his involvement in the administration‚Äôs push for intervention in Iraq, over the concerns of many of America‚Äôs longtime allies, for which his tenure at State would become best known. In February 2003, Powell delivered a  speech  before the United Nations in which he presented evidence that the US intelligence community said proved Iraq had misled inspectors and hid weapons of mass destruction. ‚ÄúThere can be no doubt,‚Äù Powell  warned , ‚Äúthat Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.‚Äù Inspectors, however, later found no such weaponry in Iraq, and two years after Powell‚Äôs UN speech, a government report said the intelligence community was ‚Äúdead wrong‚Äù in its assessments of Iraq‚Äôs weapons of mass destruction capabilities before the US invasion. But the damage was already done ‚Äî to both Iraq, which the US went to war with just six weeks after Powell‚Äôs speech, and to the reputation of the once highly popular statesman, who was  reportedly  told by then-Vice President Dick Cheney before the UN speech: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points.‚Äù Powell, who left the State Department in early 2005 after submitting his resignation to Bush the previous year, later called his UN speech a ‚Äúblot‚Äù that will forever be on his record. ‚ÄúI regret it now because the information was wrong ‚Äî of course I do,‚Äù he  told  CNN‚Äôs Larry King in 2010. ‚ÄúBut I will always be seen as the one who made the case before the international community.‚Äù ‚ÄúI swayed public opinion, there‚Äôs no question about it,‚Äù he added, referring to how influential his speech was on public support for the invasion. In his 2012 memoir, ‚ÄúIt Worked for Me,‚Äù Powell again acknowledged the speech, writing that his account of it in the book would likely be the last he publicly made. ‚ÄúI am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me,‚Äù he wrote, referring to the report he used that contained faulty evidence of supposed Iraqi WMDs. ‚ÄúIt was by no means my first, but it was one of my most momentous failures, the one with the widest-ranging impact.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe event will earn a prominent paragraph in my obituary,‚Äù Powell wrote. Shifting politics After leaving the Bush administration, Powell returned to private life. He  joined  the renowned venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins in 2005, where he worked as a strategic adviser until his death. For a time, he gave speeches at ‚ÄúGet Motivated!‚Äù business seminars, and he authored the 2012 memoir. Though the large majority of Powell‚Äôs time as a public servant was spent in Republican administrations, the later years of his life saw him supporting Democratic presidential candidates and harshly criticizing top Republican leaders. By 2008, the longtime Republican‚Äôs coveted presidential  endorsement  went to another party when he announced his support for Obama‚Äôs White House bid. At the time, he touted Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúability to inspire‚Äù and the ‚Äúinclusive nature of his campaign,‚Äù while criticizing attacks on the Illinois senator by Republican presidential nominee John McCain‚Äôs campaign as ‚Äúinappropriate.‚Äù He was later named an honorary co-chair of Obama‚Äôs inauguration and endorsed him again in 2012. Powell went on to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 over Donald Trump, whom he had strongly condemned as a ‚Äúnational disgrace and an international pariah.‚Äù In an extraordinary move that year, three presidential electors in Washington state  cast votes  for Powell rather than Clinton, resulting in state fines that were later upheld by the Supreme Court. He again snubbed Trump in 2020 during the President‚Äôs second campaign,  announcing  his support for Joe Biden in June of that year while blasting Trump‚Äôs presidency. ‚ÄúWe have a Constitution. And we have to follow that Constitution. And the President has drifted away from it,‚Äù  he told CNN , adding that he ‚Äúcertainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year.‚Äù The retired general later delivered an address in support of Biden during the Democratic National Convention. And after Trump incited a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol in early January 2021, Powell told CNN that he no longer considered himself a Republican, with the longtime grandee of the GOP saying he was now simply watching events unfold in a country he long served. ‚ÄúI can no longer call myself a fellow Republican. I‚Äôm not a fellow of anything right now,‚Äù he told CNN‚Äôs Fareed Zakaria on ‚ÄúGPS.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a citizen who has voted Republican, voted Democrat throughout my entire career. And right now, I‚Äôm just watching my country and not concerned with parties.‚Äù This story has been updated with additional information.

But the path to recovery has been far from smooth. Shortages and price hikes across a whole range of products continue to plague consumers, and they‚Äôre likely to persist in the short-term. It‚Äôs yet another side effect of COVID, though one that economists predict should improve with time. The early days of lockdown were marked with widespread scarcity for certain key items. Hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and masks topped the list, as people sought protection from the little-understood virus. Toilet paper, being maybe the top panic purchase of all-time, also ran low. Stores couldn‚Äôt keep any of it on the shelves. And then, as suppliers struggled to meet demand, stores couldn‚Äôt get it on the shelves at all. Prices, however, remained fairly stable, at least at major stores. READ MORE:  Stimulus Check Update: Is A Fourth Relief Payment Coming? Demand eventually leveled off, or supply rose to meet the elevated need. Or maybe both. People learned that transmission of the virus happened chiefly through the air rather than from surfaces, lessening the need for sanitizer and wipes. Mask production picked up as the pandemic timeline stretched further and further into the future. And toilet paper returned to shelves once panic buying subsided and stores replenished their supply. Other consumer goods became harder to find as weeks of lockdown turned into months and people adapted to a new reality. Public indoor spaces, like gyms, were off-limits. And social distancing limited capacity when they did reopen. Many people weren‚Äôt comfortable returning regardless, but still wanted to work out. Hand weights became impossible to find for a time. Bicycles did as well, with people seeking a safe outdoor activity. Baking became a popular indoor diversion leading to shortages of flour and yeast. With remote learning the norm for school-age children, inexpensive laptops, specifically Chromebooks, became hard to find in the weeks leading up to the start of the school year and through much of the fall. Higher demand was a big issue. Gartner estimates that Chromebook shipments grew by about  90 percent  year over year in the third quarter of the 2020 and  200 percent  year over year in the fourth quarter. But surging demand wasn‚Äôt the whole problem. Supply couldn‚Äôt keep up. The makers of Chromebooks might have met more of the demand had manufacturers not shut down in the pandemic‚Äôs early days. And then there‚Äôs the complicated  supply chain , which pulls in component parts from various places, assembles them into computers in China and then ships those computers to America and everywhere else. Each of those suppliers likely experienced their own COVID-related slowdowns and shutdowns, crimping supply chains even further. U.S.  government sanctions  on certain Chinese government suppliers made matters more difficult as well. Some version of this supply chain story has played out for countless consumer products across the economy, and will continue to play out until demand evens out and supply catches up. Reports have recently surfaced about shortages and rising prices for everything from  chlorine tablets  for swimming pools to  boba , the tapioca pearls in bubble tea. The pandemic has played a role in both of these cases. Home pool usage in warm-weather locales has increased with people stuck at home. Shipments of boba and the starch used to make it are backlogged, along with many other  shipments from Asia  across a wide variety of industries. It‚Äôs unclear when things will return to normal. Shortages and higher prices are influenced by a range of factors. As Ori Heffetz, Associate Professor of Economics at Cornell University‚Äôs SC Johnson School of Business, explains, ‚ÄúYou need workers, inputs, materials or commodities [to make a product]. And you need capital. And then you need transportation. And above all, you‚Äôre trying to predict demand patterns. Things take time to produce, so you try to be ahead of demand patterns. The short answer is this is a work in progress.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have bottlenecks in almost each one of these things,‚Äù Heffetz continued. ‚ÄúWorkers, materials, commodities, transportation, and the big one, predicting demand patterns. I can point to issues with each one of them.‚Äù READ MORE:  Child Tax Credit: Parents Will Soon Get A Monthly Check, But For How Much? Some of these issues are broad. Many companies across various industries claim there is a shortage of workers. A recent  disappointing¬† jobs report  for the month of April supports those claims. Employers added 266,000 jobs in the month, far below the 1 million they were expected to add. While 331,000 jobs returned in leisure and hospitality, those gains were countered by losses in temporary help services, transportation and warehousing and the auto sector. Generous unemployment benefits factor into the lag in hiring. Fear of an unsafe work environment, particularly with regard to social distancing and person-to-person contact, also plays a part. A third factor is  relocation friction , changes in the employers‚Äô needs in terms of employee skills and workers‚Äô needs in terms of employment. According to Heffetz, ‚Äúpart of it is the old story of workers not keeping up. Those workers who lost their jobs working in a restaurant will not be very quickly be rehired doing something else. These are things that take time.‚Äù With demand rising across much of the economy, demand for commodities used to make things is also rising. ‚ÄúWhen global demand collapsed a year ago, we saw prices collapsing, and now the world is coming back,‚Äù said Heffetz. ‚ÄúSo strong demand, high commodity prices.‚Äù Rising commodity prices and shortages mean economy-wide difficulties in producers securing what they need to make products. That could translate to boba makers not having enough starch. That could also lead to makers of computers and cars (and smartphones and many other modern devices)  not having enough microchips . Without these inputs, production lines sit idle and workers lose hours. And in the case of cars, that leads to higher car prices and fewer new cars available for sale. Buyers then flock to the used car market, pushing up those prices too. Supply chain difficulties are also affecting restaurants. According to Christina Gonzalez, owner of  Taqueria Los Comales  in Chicago, ‚ÄúNothing ever has been comparable exactly to what we‚Äôve been going through right now.‚Äù ‚ÄúChicken, meats, produce, paper ‚Äì anything that basically has to be transported by fuel has gone up,‚Äù she continued. Pick an industry, and it‚Äôs probably struggling to work out supply chain issues brought on or exacerbated by the pandemic. A recent  Federal Reserve report  summarizing comments received from across the business community cited ‚Äúwidespread supply chain disruptions‚Äù as a major factor influence on current business activity. Companies have to revive and retool their supply chains in the midst of drastic changes in consumer demand patterns. COVID has changed how people consume. And companies have to guess now where demand for their product will be when everything settles in the future. That‚Äôs hard enough in a normal economy. In an economy emerging from a pandemic, it becomes much harder still.

So on top of the usual things, we‚Äôre having to keep up with the quickly recovering economy, but it‚Äôs not quickly recovering to what it used to be, to the old prices, the old inventories, the old products and patterns. We‚Äôre reemerging into a post-COVID world. This will just take time, some think it will take a long time.‚Äù                                 ", "sentiment": 0.09452199008720749, "subjectivity": 0.423777464081812, "wordcount": 1288}

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School MW-  Hey Marcel, good to see you! Season four of  The Neighborhood  still going strong. How does it feel to be a part of this show with all the success you‚Äôve had as a cast? MS-  That means a lot. One of the really amazing privileges is that I get an opportunity to be a part of something that I feel like talks about who we are, at this time. Where we are and what it‚Äôs like to be just the average American family. I think it‚Äôs one of those things that‚Äôs very nostalgic in that way. It‚Äôs so relatable and it cuts across a lot of cultural divides which I think was the purpose of the show. To get to do that and then to get the longevity to do it for four years now and still counting is really, really exciting. MW-  As a bit of a younger actor on the show, how much does it mean to be able to work with people like Cedric and Tichina and Max and Beth? MS-  It‚Äôs still not real. It‚Äôs still not real, like even today with Tichina. In this episode we don‚Äôt really interact as much, so I was passing by in rehearsal and she was like oh my gosh I haven‚Äôt seen you! I have to pinch myself and be like this is Tichina Arnold, it‚Äôs surreal. It‚Äôs one of those things where I‚Äôm honored that I get to learn from them and work with them as I‚Äôve grown, but also as a fan it makes me just like super excited every day. MW-  As you‚Äôve grown as an actor, how has Marty grown as a character? MS- ¬† The cool thing about Marty is him sort of being the bridge between the two families. He has a foot in both worlds being sort of an outsider amongst the Butler‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a little nerdy and a little corny and relating to Dave in that way. He‚Äôs also still being very much a part of the Butler‚Äôs though and has like a cool balance to sort of hold on to. As we‚Äôve developed his character and his role as young man he‚Äôs sort of finding his individuality and being comfortable in his own skin. He‚Äôs learning about love and life and these tougher life lessons that younger millennials are probably relating to right now. It‚Äôs interesting to watch a character like Marty sort of go through these growing pains and changes in and try find himself. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall MW-  As you‚Äôve flushed out Marty as a character over the years, are there any aspects of yourself you‚Äôve started to bring in? MS-  100%. I would say a good portion of Marty is, is Marcel. I‚Äôm a nerd, I‚Äôm a mama‚Äôs boy, I‚Äôm really big on family. Marty has this genuine love and and almost childlike innocence in the way he approaches things; is something that I have always had. I think those are the things about Marty I really admire and those are the parts of myself that I wish I could go to and live in a little more. MW-  In tonight‚Äôs episode Marty is getting set up by a professional matchmaker, what‚Äôs in store for viewers? MS-  So Marty is really putting himself out there. I think in the past, especially in the past season, he‚Äôs been more reserved and he‚Äôs sort of either had crushes on whoever happened to be next to him even if it wasn‚Äôt an obvious fit. He wants so badly to be with someone and be somebody‚Äôs partner that it kind of influences his decision making. Marty is planning to be more selective now and sort of define what he wants. He‚Äôs at an age now where he‚Äôs starting to think beyond just himself. He has a good job, he‚Äôs got his own place with his brother and now he wants that missing piece. I think a lot of young people are turning to the apps these days and so Marty is trying it the old fashioned way; like the old, old fashioned way [Laughs]. So he is getting a matchmaker to find him some lovely candidates and we‚Äôll see how it unfolds tonight. MW-  Wishing the best for Marty and always a pleasure to speak with you Marcel. All the best and take care! MS- ¬†Thank you, man.

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.96 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 18 to 703. Of those hospitalized, 516 remain in acute care and 178 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 551,807 total confirmed cases and 10,504 deaths. There are 3,970,057 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,218,913 doses. Of those, 4,023,879 are first doses with 4,062 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,661,853 second doses, 3,768 in the last day. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 308,204 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 220 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The state has administered 224,977 additional or booster vaccine doses, 7,979 in the last day. The state reported 85.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of Marylanders who have rolled up their sleeves over the past 10 months, Maryland is one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 25,476 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, October 13. Less than 0.71% of fully vaccinated Marylanders have later tested positive. Of those cases, 1,842 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 10.8% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. 233 fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Tiny heads stick out of the back seat windows, tightly close their eyes and tilt back as the insides of their noses are swabbed for hints of coronavirus infection. For children who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 in one of Marietta City Schools‚Äô classrooms, early morning testing in a nearby church parking lot has become the routine ‚Äî instead of quarantine. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School If the exposed students test negative and have no symptoms, they can continue going to school in person ‚Äî offering some relief for parents who have been overwhelmed with remote schooling during the pandemic. If the exposed student tests positive, they must isolate at home. This approach is called  test-to-stay , and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now working with select school districts across the nation to evaluate the practice. Marietta City Schools told CNN that it originally implemented its test-to-stay program on its own; it‚Äôs now one of the school districts in touch with the CDC as part of its evaluation process. ‚ÄúIn Marietta we have been tracking students who are testing positive through test-to-stay, and it‚Äôs 3%,‚Äù Grant Rivera, superintendent of Marietta City Schools in Georgia, told CNN on Monday. ‚ÄúThree percent of our students who participate in test-to-stay test positive, which means we can keep 97% of them in class,‚Äù Rivera said. ‚ÄúThat is a measure of success.‚Äù Under a traditional quarantine program, the 97% of students who tested negative would still stay at home from school. For its  test-to-stay program , any student or staff member who is identified as a school-based close contact of someone with Covid-19 and remains asymptomatic has the option to participate in ‚Äútest-and-stay.‚Äù For example, one week in late September, 318 students and three staff members were eligible for test-to-stay over five days. In that time, 123 tests were performed. Six tests were positive and 117 were negative. ‚ÄúI think for the foreseeable future, we will be out here every morning on a school day making sure that our kids have this option,‚Äù Rivera said about test-to-stay. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing this in Marietta not because we have CDC or public health guidance. Quite candidly, we‚Äôre doing it because we saw a model in another state,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, for me as a superintendent who has been tasked to not only develop these solutions but to lead them, I want more guidance from public health based on today‚Äôs data and today‚Äôs dynamics.‚Äù CDC evaluates test-to-stay Federal public health officials have been meeting with states to discuss a potential ‚Äútest-to-stay‚Äù strategy for schools, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week during a White House virtual coronavirus briefing. This type of policy would prioritize testing as a way to monitor students who may have been exposed to Covid-19, allowing students to continue to attend classes if they test negative rather than quarantine. But there are still many health experts who agree that  quarantines are still necessary . In an email to CNN, CDC said it views test-to-stay as a ‚Äúpromising practice‚Äù and said it‚Äôs ‚Äúworking with multiple jurisdictions implementing test to stay to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy.‚Äù But it‚Äôs not clear when that test-to-stay guidance could be available. While there are many different approaches to tracking and containing Covid-19 outbreaks in schools, at least three superintendents ‚Äî Rivera; Michael Karner in Lake County, Illinois and Demetrus Liggins in Fayette County, Kentucky ‚Äî have all adopted some form of test-to-stay programs in their school districts. Lake County, Illinois, has been one of the areas sharing data on test-to-stay programs with the CDC. Michael Karner, the regional superintendent of schools and a parent of two children, told CNN that test-to-stay programs have been successful at keeping kids in school safely, if other mitigation measures, such as wearing masks, are in place. ‚ÄúThis program has allowed us to test for in-school exposures ‚Äî where in the past last year, if you remember, anybody who was a close contact was quarantined. The big things for us is there must be appropriate, layered mitigation, such as social distancing and mask-wearing,‚Äù Karner said. ‚ÄúIf those are not being followed, then the test-to-stay program would not work for those close contacts.‚Äù Data from the test-to-stay program show that for Lake County, fewer than 2% of kids exposed to the coronavirus in classrooms convert to a positive case, Karner said. ‚ÄúLast year we had lots of students ‚Äî hundreds of students ‚Äî quarantine just because they were close contacts. But this year, we found that we‚Äôve been able to keep several hundred individuals that were contacts in schools, and we‚Äôve also been able to get data with regards to exposure,‚Äù Karner said. ‚ÄúBased on all the data that we‚Äôve gotten in Lake County, we found out that exposure in the classroom is not leading to conversion, which means we‚Äôre not having many close contacts in the classroom. Most of the close contact situations that we‚Äôve had with regards to exposure have been on the bus and in the lunchroom,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOn the bus, they‚Äôre very close. Sometimes kids don‚Äôt wear their masks on the bus. And in the lunchroom, obviously, when students sometimes are sitting closer than the recommended social distancing, that‚Äôs when we found it.‚Äù In Kentucky, Demetrus Liggins said that out of the 402 Covid-19 tests that his school district conducted so far through its test-to-stay pilot program, only four tests yielded positive results. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve also found for us that we‚Äôve had very minimal students that ‚Äî since we began this process on September 27 ‚Äî have tested positive after returning to school on a normal basis. And there also is an opt-in option,‚Äù Liggins said ‚ÄúWe still have some parents that choose to quarantine their students.‚Äù Karner and Liggins both emphasized that their school districts require masking for indoor activities, and that mitigation measure adds to the success of their test-to-stay programs. In a contrast, Rivera of Marietta City Schools recently announced that for his district,  masks now are optional  in school buildings and on school buses. The new masking policy went into effect Saturday. ‚ÄúMarietta recently transitioned to a mask optional approach. The reason for that is several. First of all, we‚Äôre seeing significant decline in community transmission. We‚Äôre also seeing a decrease in community positivity rate. Additionally, we‚Äôre seeing fewer epi-linked cases in our classrooms,‚Äù Rivera said. ‚ÄúSo for us, I don‚Äôt believe that public health protocol should be static. We have to make sure that our protocols evolve with the data.‚Äù The  CDC notes on its website  that test-to-stay may be a practice comprised of regular testing and contact tracing, but that‚Äôs also while ‚Äúmaintaining other layered prevention strategies, such as universal masking, to reduce the spread of Covid-19.‚Äù What the science says As researchers and public health experts continue to examine the data around test-to-stay programs, two studies typically emerge in discussions: one out of Utah and the other out of the United Kingdom. The  study led by researchers at the Utah Department of Health  estimates that a test-to-stay program implemented at 13 high schools in Utah collectively saved 109,752 days of in-person instruction for students who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have been kept in school. The study,  published by the CDC in May , detailed two state programs in Utah, called test-to-play and test-to-stay. Under test-to-play, students were tested for Covid-19 every two weeks in order to be allowed to continue extracurricular activities. In test-to-stay, school-wide testing was implemented in response to Covid-19 outbreaks, as opposed to a switch to remote instruction. Researchers credited the test-to-play program with preserving 95% of planned athletic events. A separate study conducted in England,  published last month in the journal The Lancet , found similar rates of symptomatic coronavirus infections among students and staff within schools that follow test-to-stay compared with schools that follow traditional quarantines. ‚ÄúThey found no statistically significant difference between the Covid-19 rates in schools which did implement test-to-stay and those which implemented a more traditional quarantine,‚Äù said Dr. Meagan Fitzpatrick, an infectious disease transmission modeler and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland, who was not involved in the study. ‚ÄúThis is also supported by modeling work that my group has done, as well as others have done.‚Äù ‚ÄòIt should be less controversial than it is‚Äô Fitzpatrick acknowledged that test-to-stay is a ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù approach. ‚ÄúI think, in my expert opinion, that it should be less controversial than it is,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I definitely understand why people hesitate and why people are looking for a firmer research basis for the test-to-stay program.‚Äù In March, the  US Department of Health and Human Services announced it was funneling $10 billion  to states to help implement coronavirus surveillance testing in K-12 schools across the country. For most of the test-to-stay programs currently underway, schools have received free Covid-19 tests and some test administrators from their state health departments. But even with the funding for tests made available in some places, many schools may not have the necessary personnel ‚Äî such as school nurses or other staff members ‚Äî to organize and coordinate such a large testing operation. As the CDC continues to evaluate test-to-stay programs, the logistics and resources needed to implement such an approach likely will be a serious part of conversations. ‚ÄúThe number-one difficulty that I have heard, when I discuss these test-to-stay programs here in Maryland, is personnel,‚Äù Fitzpatrick said. ‚ÄúWhen these school districts consider the test-to-stay program, what that requires is it requires somebody to keep track of which students have been designated contacts of the first infection. And so it requires to track who those students are, and to track their test results every day, and to cross-check again that they‚Äôre getting their tests before they enter the school,‚Äù Fitzpatrick said. ‚ÄúParticularly the  school nursing staff is already overstretched , and it seems that many of these districts face challenges in getting the additional staff that they would need.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized The-CNN-Wire  ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

CBS 2‚Äôs Tara Molina reports that retail leaders say the problem is so bad, that new business is hesitant to move in. That hesitation stems not only from the continued retail theft and robbery issue here, and across the city, but the perception that the city isn‚Äôt a safe place to be right now. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School A stretch of North Michigan Avenue remains vacant and locked up‚Äìtelling of the struggle on the city‚Äôs Mag Mile. Former tenants like Macy‚Äôs and Disney are gone, and there are no plans for a new tenant for the old Macy‚Äôs space at the Water Tower Place anytime soon. ‚ÄúI think it does not help in terms of the recovery for downtown Chicago,‚Äù said Robb Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association. ‚ÄúThe impression around the nation is that Chicago is not a very safe place to be. And the incidents we saw this morning, over the weekend, the episodes before that, only feed that.‚Äù Karr said the sales tax loss related to these continued crimes hits the city, county, and state of Illinois.¬† With continued robberies in the area, Chicago police have issued a warning about suspects only described as young men, in their teens, robbing items on display. No one is in custody, and the robberies are still under investigation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a serious problem, and we have to address it,‚Äù said Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd), adding the impact on the city is much bigger than the police warning because shoppers and visitors aren‚Äôt the only people taking notice. ‚ÄúThe commercial brokers tell us that when they get potential interest from a tenant, that‚Äôs one of the first questions they ask, is what‚Äôs happening in Chicago to stem the tide of retail shoplifting rings that have been operating with impunity downtown?

At least three 7-Elevens were hit during the Monday morning commute, by crews of armed robbers downtown. ‚ÄúThe Police Department has to work in closer conjunction with the State‚Äôs Attorneys office, they‚Äôve been very reluctant to prosecute retail theft,‚Äù said Hopkins. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Karr agreed. ‚ÄúI think we have to look at prosecution,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúClearly there‚Äôs a feeling running through the criminal elements that there are no consequences here. We have to look to the courts, and I think we have to just look to all the players in this drama to get Chicago to what it once was.‚Äù Hopkins said Chicago police are trying to take a proactive approach by acting on information from sources. ‚ÄúWe have a tactical plan in place to respond to any intelligence that comes our way about planned retail theft. There was a rumor one of the high end stores on Oak Street was going to get hit, yet again, this weekend,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe were able to deploy a force, including undercover resources. It didn‚Äôt happen, fortunately, but we were ready if it did.‚Äù¬† The Cook County State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office released the following statement with regard to concerns on the Mag Mile: ‚ÄúWe recognize community concerns around crime, and the impact it can have on one‚Äôs sense of safety as well as the economic stability of a business. We continue to prosecute retail theft cases as misdemeanors and felonies when appropriate to do so based on the facts and evidence.‚Äù The State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office said this year to date, its prosecutors have reviewed and issued charges for 38 retail theft cases in ZIP code 60611, which includes the Mag Mile and Streeterville. A total of 18 were approved for felony charges, 10 were prosecuted, and convictions were obtained for six. The State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office also noted that in December 2016, State‚Äôs Attorney Kim Foxx increased the threshold for felony retail theft charges to $1,000, which the office said has allowed the prosecutors to focus on the drivers of violence rather than low-level nonviolent offenses. Prosecutors said misdemeanor charges are issued for some such thefts, but those are not included in the aforementioned data. The State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office also said this year to date, it has reviewed 82 gun cases in the 60611 ZIP code, approved charges on 70, prosecuted 29, and obtained convictions on 23.

The report also found the new policy headed off new arrests for low-level drug possession and prostitution, particularly in Black communities. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Baltimore State‚Äôs Attorney Marilyn Mosby ordered her staff to  drop all pending charges  against people arrested for certain non-violent offenses. The move was initially designed to curb the spread of coronavirus among inmates, but about a year later, her office announced  the policy would remain in place. ‚ÄúThere is no public safety value, and never really was any public safety value, in prosecuting these low-level offenses,‚Äù Mosby said at the time. ‚ÄúIt is wholly counterproductive to continue to prioritize low-level offenses over violent crime.‚Äù A key finding from the Hopkins report, ‚Äú Evaluation of Prosecutorial Drug Policy Reforms in Baltimore, Maryland ,‚Äù was that less than 1% of those who had their charges dropped went on to carry out more serious crimes. Based on an analysis of Maryland Courts Judicial Information System arrest data, of the 741 people whose drug and prostitution charges were dropped under the new policy, only six were later arrested for serious crimes. University researchers said crimes covered by the analysis included: robbery, murder, manslaughter, guns and weapons charges, assault, sex offense, carjacking, home invasion, kidnapping, arson, and drug distribution. Based on an analysis of Baltimore Police Department arrest data, researchers found that an estimated 443 new drug possession and prostitution arrests were avoided. The report said most of those arrests (78%) would‚Äôve impacted the Black community.

The report covered the 14 months following the policy change, from April 2020 to May 2021. The study‚Äôs authors said the findings suggest drug- and prostitution-related offenses should be reclassified as a public health problem, rather than criminal activity. ‚ÄúWe found these results very encouraging on the whole because we know that putting people into the criminal legal system is harmful to their mental and physical health, and it seems that Baltimore has been able to reduce that problem without incurring a significant cost in terms of public safety,‚Äù lead author Saba Rouhani, Ph.D., said. ‚ÄúWe think that the next step is to start a dialogue about providing public health services to these people that are no longer going to be arrested,‚Äù senior author Susan Sherman said. ‚ÄúWe should now be asking, is there a sufficient safety net of harm reduction services, treatment, and social services to meet the needs of people who are no longer arrested?‚Äù The report is part of an ongoing research collaboration between Mosby‚Äôs office and the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

According to Frosh‚Äôs office, the jury heard testimony that Mungo, who was 16 at the time of the murder, had Dvorak‚Äôs cell phone and Nintendo Switch shortly after Dvorak was  robbed and shot in the chest  in the 2500 block of Boston Street on June 13, 2017.

His defense said he was not the person who pulled the trigger. Prosecutors said Mungo was a member of the gang 500 L, or simply 500, an affiliate of the Bloods operating out of McElderry Park. The gang sold heroin, fentanyl, cocaine and other drugs and maintained control of their territory with the possession and trafficking of firearms, prosecutors said. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúMembers of the 500 L gang used violence as their calling card, flooding the streets with fear as they tried to tear down our neighborhoods and terrorize our communities. We cannot, and will not, let them get away with it. Too many families have suffered because of their cold-blooded actions,‚Äù said Thomas J. Sobocinski, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Baltimore Field Office. Mungo is one of 13 defendants charged in 2018 with gang, drug and gun offenses following Dvorak‚Äôs murder. All have either pleaded guilty or been convicted in court, Frosh‚Äôs office said. Mungo‚Äôs defense attorney, Mark Van Bavel, said his client will appeal. Maryland‚Äôs gang statute allows prosecutors to charge all crimes committed by a gang in the jurisdiction of any one crime. The attorney general‚Äôs office chose to prosecute Mungo in Baltimore County since some gang members lived in the county and kept drugs there. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 10.

(WJZ/AP) ‚Äî  Officials announced Tuesday that Jonathan and Diana Toebbe were indicted today by a Grand Jury in Elkins, West Virginia, on national security charges. Forty-two-year-old Jonathan Toebbe and 45-year-old Diana Toebbe were both charged with one count of conspiracy to communicate restricted data and two counts of communication of restricted data. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The Toebbe‚Äôs are due in court Wednesday for a detention hearing in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The FBI says the scheme began in April 2020 when Jonathan Toebbe sent a package of Navy documents to a foreign government and wrote that he was interested in selling to that country operations manuals, performance reports and other sensitive information. Authorities say he also provided instructions for how to conduct the furtive relationship, with a letter that said: ‚ÄúI apologize for this poor translation into your language. Please forward this letter to your military intelligence agency. I believe this information will be of great value to your nation. This is not a hoax.‚Äù That package, which had a return address in Pittsburgh, was obtained by the FBI last December through its legal attache office in the unspecified foreign country. The court documents don‚Äôt explain how the FBI came to receive the package or from whom. In any event, the FBI used Toebbe‚Äôs outreach as the launching pad for a monthslong undercover operation in which an agent posing as a representative of a foreign contact made contact with Toebbe and agreed to pay thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency for the information that Toebbe was offering. After weeks of back and forth over email, the undercover agent in June sent Toebbe about $10,000 in cryptocurrency, describing it as a sign of good faith and trust, the FBI says. Weeks later, federal agents watched as the Toebbes arrived at an agreed-upon location in West Virginia for the exchange, with Diana Toebbe appearing to serve as a lookout for her husband during a dead-drop operation for which the FBI paid $20,000. The FBI recovered a blue memory card wrapped in plastic and placed between two slices of bread on a half of a peanut butter sandwich, court documents say. The records on the memory card included design elements and performance characteristics of Virginia-class submarine reactors. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The Justice Department describes those submarines as ‚Äúcruise missile fast-attack submarines, which incorporate the latest in stealth, intelligence gathering, and weapons systems technology.‚Äù The memory card also included a typed message that said, in part: ‚ÄúI hope your experts are very happy with the sample provided and I understand the importance of a small exchange to grow our trust.‚Äù The FBI conducted similar dead-drop exchanges over the next several months, including one in August in eastern Virginia for which Toebbe was paid roughly $70,000. In that instance, prosecutors say, he concealed in a chewing gum package a memory card that contained schematic designs for the Virginia-class submarine. The complaint alleges violations of the Atomic Energy Act, which restricts the disclosure of information related to atomic weapons or nuclear materials. The Toebbes had their initial court appearances Tuesday in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Jonathan Toebbe has worked for the U.S. government since 2012, holding a top-secret security clearance and specializing in naval nuclear propulsion, the FBI says. He has also been assigned to a government-owned laboratory in the Pittsburgh area that officials say works on nuclear power for the U.S. Navy. No one answered at the Toebbe residence on Sunday afternoon in a waterside Annapolis community by the South River. An outside light was on above the door of their home, and a dog barked inside. John Cooley, who lives across the street from the Toebbes, said he counted more than 30 FBI agents on his block on Saturday from about 2:30 p.m. until after dark. He said agents went inside the home.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by 0.08% to 3.36%. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.96 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 18 to 703. Of those hospitalized, 516 remain in acute care and 178 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 551,807 total confirmed cases and 10,504 deaths. There are 3,970,057 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,218,913 doses. Of those, 4,023,879 are first doses with 4,062 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,661,853 second doses, 3,768 in the last day. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 308,204 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 220 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The state has administered 224,977 additional or booster vaccine doses, 7,979 in the last day. The state reported 85.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. ‚ÄúThanks to the millions of Marylanders who have rolled up their sleeves over the past 10 months, Maryland is one of the most vaccinated states in America,‚Äù said Governor Hogan. ‚ÄúWe have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.‚Äù In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 27,420 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, October 20. Less than 0.76% of fully vaccinated Marylanders have later tested positive. Of those cases, 1,995 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 11.3% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. 261 fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 11.8% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

There is ‚Äúgrowing concern within the FDA‚Äù that US data is beginning to show more hospitalizations among people under age 65 who have been fully vaccinated, the source said. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Still, Americans who haven‚Äôt been vaccinated are 18 times more likely to end up hospitalized with Covid-19 than those who are vaccinated, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated people are also 11 times more likely to die from Covid-19 compared to vaccinated people, Walensky said Wednesday. They were also six times more likely to test positive for Covid-19. ‚ÄúIn August, as we were experiencing the peak of the Delta surge, 16 jurisdictions provided data on cases and deaths stratified by vaccination status. Unvaccinated people had 6.1 times greater risk of testing positive for Covid-19,‚Äù the CDC director said. Getting younger kids vaccinated will ‚Äòplay a major role‚Äô in slowing Covid-19 spread, Fauci says  About 28 million children ages 5 to 11 might soon be able to get pediatric doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine if the US Food and Drug Administration authorizes shots for that age group and if the CDC recommends it. Getting most children vaccinated against Covid-19 will ‚Äúplay a major role‚Äù in slowing the spread of disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday. ‚ÄúIn the era of Delta, children get infected as readily as adults do. And they transmit the infection as readily as adults do,‚Äù said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ‚ÄúIf we can get the overwhelming majority of those 28 million children vaccinated, I think that would play a major role in diminishing the spread of infection,‚Äù Fauci said at a White House Covid-19 briefing. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of the reasons why we want to do as best as we can to get those children from 5 to 11 vaccinated.‚Äù More news on booster shots expected soon  The FDA last month authorized Pfizer booster shots for people in certain high-risk groups who got their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at least six months ago. That includes people age 65 and older; adults with health conditions that put them at high risk for severe Covid-19; and adults who live or work in places that put them at high risk of contracting Covid-19. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall Advisers to the FDA recently recommended people in those same high-risk groups who got the Moderna vaccine instead of Pfizer‚Äôs should also be able to get a booster dose. But the FDA has not yet authorized Moderna booster shots for those groups. As for those who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, FDA advisers recommended all adults who got the single-shot vaccine get a booster dose at least two months after the first shot. The FDA is considering that recommendation. Schools try testing instead of isolating exposed students  While some schools have enforced strict quarantine and isolation policies for children who are exposed to the virus, the CDC is working with select school districts to evaluate test-to-stay programs. Such programs first involve testing ‚Äî not quarantining ‚Äî students who may have been exposed to Covid-19 at school. If the exposed students test negative and have no symptoms, they can continue going to school in person. If they test positive, they must isolate at home. ‚ÄúIn Marietta, we have been tracking students who are testing positive through test-to-stay, and it‚Äôs 3%,‚Äù Grant Rivera, superintendent of Marietta City Schools in Georgia, told CNN this week. ‚ÄúThree percent of our students who participate in test-to-stay test positive, which means we can keep 97% of them in class,‚Äù Rivera said. ‚ÄúThat is a measure of success.‚Äù Under a traditional quarantine program, the 97% of students who tested negative would still stay at home from school. ‚ÄúI think for the foreseeable future, we will be out here every morning on a school day making sure that our kids have this option,‚Äù Rivera said about test-to-stay. The CDC notes on its website that test-to-stay may be a practice comprised of regular testing and contact tracing, but that‚Äôs also while ‚Äúmaintaining other layered prevention strategies, such as universal masking, to reduce the spread of Covid-19.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized The-CNN-Wire  ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

But they currently lead the division as the NFL‚Äôs only remaining undefeated team. And their 37-14 thrashing of the Cleveland Browns convinced many doubters that this Cardinals team is for real. But can they continue to outpace the Los Angeles Rams? The Rams, behind new quarterback Matthew Stafford, continue to win and impress. They dominated the New York Giants, 38-11, in Week 6. While the San Francisco 49ers enjoyed a bye, the Seattle Seahawks dropped a heartbreaker to the Pittsburgh Steelers. READ MORE:  Bengals Visit Ravens With AFC North Lead On The Line CBS San Francisco sports anchor Vern Glenn looks at the four NFC West matchups in Week 7. All times listed are Eastern. Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Detroit Lions @ Los Angeles Rams, Sunday, October 24 @ 4:05 p.m. The Lions and Rams traded quarterbacks this past offseason. Jared Goff, who led the Rams to Super Bowl LIII, went to Detroit. And longtime Lions‚Äô signal-caller Matthew Stafford became the starter in Los Angeles. Both QBs needed a change of scenery. The Rams couldn‚Äôt repeat that 2018 season, and it became clear that maybe Goff wasn‚Äôt the best fit in Sean McVay‚Äôs offense. The Lions had been perennially bad, despite Stafford‚Äôs impressive numbers. ‚ÄúThis is the game that I‚Äôm sure Jared Goff has had circled ever since he was traded from the Rams to the Lions.‚Äù Glenn said. ‚ÄúAnd locally here, Jared Goff is our guy. He grew up in Marin County, right outside of San Francisco. So he has been looking forward to this one. It wasn‚Äôt the smoothest transition this trade from the Rams to the Lions for him. But here they come, SoFi stadium. We have all that drama, McVay and Goff.‚Äù The Rams come into Week 7 with a 5-1 record. Stafford remains one of the game‚Äôs best passers, averaging 306.3 yards per game and 9.2 yards per attempt, both among the league‚Äôs top five. The Lions, despite some close calls, continue to look for that elusive first win. Goff‚Äôs numbers ‚Äî 250.8 yards per game, 6.3 yards per attempt ‚Äî pale in comparison to Stafford‚Äôs. He also doesn‚Äôt have the weapons around him that he once did. A dominant Rams defense suggests he‚Äôll have limited success again this Sunday. ‚ÄúBottom line, end zone to end zone, it has to be the Rams‚Äô day,‚Äù Glenn said. ‚ÄúFor as good as Goff is and as much revenge he wants to invoke, he doesn‚Äôt play defense. And then Stafford, in that high-powered Rams offense, they‚Äôre going to go up and down the field. It is a win for the Rams, who I believe are a double-digit favorite to close at home.‚Äù Houston Texans @ Arizona Cardinals, Sunday, October 24 @ 4:25 p.m. The Cardinals are the NFL‚Äôs last remaining undefeated team, as Kyler Murray tossed four touchdown passes in their 37-14 win last week over the Cleveland Browns. Arizona is playing for a Super Bowl, based on all of their offseason moves, though few people saw them as serious contenders going into the season. ‚ÄúI have to come clean with this one,‚Äù Glenn admits. ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the year, I did not give any love to the Arizona Cardinals. I thought this was an organization that, outside of Kyler Murray, this was the organization where a lot of aged NFL veterans would would go and finish up their career. And I‚Äôm citing J.J. Watt as one of them, following along the lines of, say, Emmitt Smith, who ended his career with the Arizona Cardinals. But 6-0 is 6-0.‚Äù READ MORE:  'Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!' On The Big Screen At M&T Bank Stadium Tonight There‚Äôs a good chance the Cardinals‚Äô winning streak will continue against Houston. The Texans were clobbered last week, 31-3, by the Indianapolis Colts, leaving them at 1-5. Davis Mills has not looked up to the task at quarterback, except for his 312-yard, three-TD showing against the New England Patriots in Week 5. According to Glenn, ‚Äúthat offensive attack for the Texans [is] just not enough to get it done on the road against Kyler Murray and Arizona, who have been the surprise of the NFL. They have to. Numbers don‚Äôt lie, 6-0 is 6-0. And again double-digit favorites to win at home.‚Äù Indianapolis Colts @ San Francisco 49ers, Sunday, October 24 @ 8:20 p.m. The 49ers are coming off their bye week. Jimmy Garoppolo looks probable for Sunday, though Trey Lance still seems hobbled by a knee injury. Overall, the team should be rested and ready for the Colts. Indianapolis easily knocked off the Texans in Week 6, with Carson Wentz spreading the ball around and looking a little more like he did a few years ago with the Philadelphia Eagles. ‚ÄúThe Niners come in a five-point home favorite,‚Äù Glenn said. ‚ÄúThe 49ers, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether Jimmy Garoppolo or Trey Lance are at quarterback. It‚Äôs not a matter what happens when they‚Äôre in the red zone, because of the 11 trips, they‚Äôve scored 10 times. It‚Äôs getting to the red zone and establishing some kind of rhythm to get there.‚Äù Coach Kyle Shanahan has had two weeks to figure out the consistency issue. But the problems also extend to the other side of the ball. The defense has been solid against the pass, allowing just 216.6 yards per game, but the quarterback pressure hasn‚Äôt been there. They‚Äôve sacked opposing quarterbacks just 11 times all season. ‚ÄúThe Colts are a pretty good football team, I‚Äôll give them that,‚Äù Glenn admits. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre much better than that a lot of people expected. But the 49ers almost have to close it out. It is a Sunday night primetime football game. And I just don‚Äôt believe that Shanahan could go two weeks without preparing for this one, to come out and shine and come out on top. I‚Äôm going 49ers.‚Äù New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks, Monday, October 25 @ 8:15 p.m. The Saints are also coming out of a bye week. At 3-2, they face the unenviable task of keeping pace with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who lead the NFC South. New Orleans heads to Seattle to meet the 2-4 Seahawks, who will once again be without Russell Wilson. The team‚Äôs longtime QB is out until at least Week 10 after his recent hand surgery. Geno Smith was 23-32 for 209 yards and a touchdown in the Seahawks‚Äô overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers last week. Smith will have Seattle‚Äôs formidable 12th man behind him this week. Lumen Field is ‚Äú‚Ä¶one of the loudest places to play in the entire NFL,‚Äù Glenn said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve experienced times where I‚Äôve actually tried to have a conversation with someone right next to me, and they could not hear the words coming out of my mouth because it is so, so loud.‚Äù The Saints have been a little hit or miss this season. After dominating the Green Bay Packers in the opener, they fell to the Carolina Panthers and then the New York Giants two weeks after. The Saints dispensed with the Washington Football Team before the break. And the extra rest should help them return some key players from injuries. ‚ÄúThey have four guys that were injured that are going to be able to participate in this game. Especially Michael Thomas, another offensive weapon. They got their left tackle back. They‚Äôve got a linebacker Kwon Alexander back.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Turgeon Still Hoping For Long Postseason Run At Maryland The offense still runs behind Alvin Kamara, who has topped 100 combined yards in his last three outings.

(AP)  ‚Äî Maryland coach Michael Locksley said the goal for his team during the bye week was to get healthy‚Äìmentally and physically. Then he immediately announced two more major injuries. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Receiver Jeshaun Jones and linebacker Durell Nchami are both expected to miss the rest of the season. Locksley said Tuesday that Jones had a lower-leg injury that requires surgery, and he said Nchami had upper-body surgery. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a team that kind of limped into the bye week,‚Äù Locksley said. The Terrapins won their first four games this season. Then their much-anticipated matchups with Iowa and Ohio State went about as badly as possible. Maryland lost standout receiver Dontay Demus to a season-ending injury in the Iowa game, and Jones went down against Ohio State. The Terps also lost both games by a combined score of 117-31. Then the schedule mercifully gave them last weekend off. ‚ÄúWe lost to two of the top teams in our league, again not being with all of our players,‚Äù Locksley said. ‚ÄúIt shows us we still have a ways to go against the elite programs, but I feel very confident that we‚Äôll get there because of the type of kids we have in our program.‚Äù Maryland plays at Minnesota this week, and these next two games‚Äìagainst the Golden Gophers and Indiana‚Äìare crucial for the Terrapins if they‚Äôre going to get back on track before another brutal stretch against Penn State, Michigan State and Michigan. ‚ÄúI think a week off is something we all needed,‚Äù quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa said. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The news on injuries wasn‚Äôt all bad. Locksley did say he thinks linebacker Brandon Jennings will be back, and he is hopeful that defensive backs Jakorian Bennett and Kenny Bennett will return as well. And although Demus and Jones have combined for 46 receptions and over 700 yards this season, the Terrapins have other capable pass catchers. Rakim Jarrett has 22 receptions for 319 yards and five touchdowns. Tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo has three TD catches‚Äìas many as he had over his previous two seasons with the Terps. Tagovailoa is averaging 314 yards passing per game, the Big Ten‚Äôs second-best mark. The question is whether he can remain at that level after losing a couple important targets. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never heard me be a guy up here that cries about losing players to injury,‚Äù Locksley said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve recruited a room of receivers that I think are really, really strong.‚Äù Darryl Jones (14 catches for 134 yards this season) and Brian Cobbs (eight catches for 86 yards) are two players who may become more important for the Terps going forward. Each is in his fourth season playing for Maryland. Facing Iowa and Ohio State was a sobering experience for the Terrapins, but they still have a chance to have a successful year relative to preseason expectations. This is a program that hasn‚Äôt had a winning season since 2014, and the next couple weeks could go a long way toward determining how much progress Maryland ultimately makes in Locksley‚Äôs third year at the helm.

Federal regulators will meet over the next two weeks to weigh the safety and effectiveness of giving low-dose shots to the roughly 28 million children in that age group. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Within hours of formal approval, which is expected after the Food and Drug Administration signs off and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel meets on Nov. 2-3, millions of doses will begin going out to providers across the country, along with the smaller needles needed for injecting young children. Within days of that, the vaccine will be ready to go into arms on a wide scale. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre completing the operational planning to ensure vaccinations for kids ages 5 to 11 are available, easy and convenient,‚Äù White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be ready, pending the FDA and CDC decision.‚Äù The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses three weeks apart and a two-week wait for full protection to kick in, meaning the first youngsters in line will be fully covered by Christmas. Some parents can hardly wait. Dr. Sterling Ransone said his rural Deltaville, Virginia, office is already getting calls from people asking for appointments for their children and saying, ‚ÄúI want my shot now.‚Äù ‚ÄúJudging by the number of calls, I think we‚Äôre going to be slammed for the first several weeks,‚Äù said Ransone, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. Justin Shady, a film and TV writer in Chicago, said his 6-year-old daughter, Grey, got nervous when he told her she would be getting the shots soon. But he is bribing her with a trip to Disney World, and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs all in.‚Äù The family likes to travel, ‚Äúwe really just want to get back in the swing of seeing the world,‚Äù Shady said. As for youngsters under 5, Pfizer and Moderna are studying their vaccines in children down to 6 months old, with results expected later in the year. The Biden administration noted that the expansion of shots to children under 12 will not look like the start of the country‚Äôs vaccine rollout 10 months ago, when limited doses and inadequate capacity meant a painstaking wait for many Americans. The country now has ample supplies of the Pfizer shot to vaccinate the children who will soon be eligible, officials said, and they have been working for months to ensure widespread availability of shots. About 15 million doses will be shipped to providers across the U.S. in the first week after approval, the White House said. More than 25,000 pediatricians and primary care providers have already signed on to dispense the vaccine to elementary school children, the White House said, in addition to the tens of thousands of drugstores that are already administering shots to adults. Hundreds of school- and community-based clinics will also be funded and supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help speed the process. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall In addition to doctors‚Äô offices, schools are likely be popular spots for the shots. In Maryland, state officials have offered to help schools set up vaccination clinics. Denver‚Äôs public schools plan to hold mass vaccination events for young children, along with smaller clinics offering shots during the school day and in the evenings. Chicago‚Äôs public health department is working closely with schools, which have already been hosting vaccination events for students age 12 and older and their families. The White House is also preparing a stepped-up campaign to educate parents and children about the safety of the shots and the ease of getting them. As has been the case for adult vaccinations, the administration believes trusted messengers ‚Äî educators, doctors and community leaders ‚Äî will be vital to encouraging vaccinations. Dr. Lisa Reed, medical director for family medicine at MAHEC, a western North Carolina safety net provider that serves patients from rural Appalachia and more urban communities such as the tourist town of Asheville, said it is going to take effort to get some families on board. Reed said she lives ‚Äúin a community that has a lot of vaccine hesitancy, unfortunately.‚Äù ‚ÄúSome have lower health literacy or belong to ethnic groups that are more hesitant in general‚Äù because of a history of mistrust, she said. And Asheville, she said, has a sizeable population of well-educated adults who are longtime vaccine skeptics. While children run a lower risk than older people of getting seriously ill from COVID-19, at least 637 people age 18 or under have died from the virus in the U.S., according to the CDC. Six million U.S. children been infected, 1 million of them since early September amid the spread of the more contagious delta variant, the American Academy of Pediatrics says. Health officials believe that expanding the vaccine drive will not only curb the alarming number of infections in children but also reduce the spread of the virus to vulnerable adults. It could also help schools stay open and youngsters get back on track academically, and contribute to the nation‚Äôs broader recovery from the pandemic. ‚ÄúCOVID has also disrupted our kids‚Äô lives. It‚Äôs made school harder, it‚Äôs disrupted their ability to see friends and family, it‚Äôs made youth sports more challenging,‚Äù U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told NBC. ‚ÄúGetting our kids vaccinated, we have the prospect of protecting them, but also getting all of those activities back that are so important to our children.‚Äù Murthy said the administration, which is imposing vaccine mandates for millions of adults, is leaving it up to state and local officials to decide whether to require schoolchildren to get vaccinated. But he said such measures would be ‚Äúa reasonable thing to consider.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also consistent with what we‚Äôve done for other childhood vaccines, like measles, mumps, polio,‚Äù he said. The U.S. has purchased 65 million doses of the Pfizer pediatric shot, which is expected to be one-third the dose given to adults and adolescents, according to officials. They will be shipped in smaller packages of about 100 doses each, so that more providers can deliver them, and they won‚Äôt require the super-cold storage that the adult version did at first. About 219 million Americans age 12 and up, or 66% of the total population, have received a COVID-19 shot, and nearly 190 million are fully vaccinated.

(WJZ) ‚Äî  A U.S. Navy nuclear engineer from Annapolis will remain in custody while  awaiting trial on espionage charges , but a federal judge has yet to determine if that should be the case for his wife. Jonathan Toebbe, 42, and his wife, Diana, 45, pleaded not guilty Wednesday when they were arraigned in a West Virginia federal court on a three-count indictment charging them with selling classified data to someone they thought was a foreign intelligence officer but was in fact an undercover FBI agent. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The couple was arrested earlier this month following an FBI sting operation. Authorities say over the course of several months, Toebbe hid memory cards filled with sensitive data inside ordinary items, such as a sandwich or a pack of gum, and dropped them off at sites in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, with his wife acting as a lookout. They were indicted Tuesday on one count of conspiracy to communicate restricted data and two counts of communication of restricted data. Each of those charges carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a $100,000 fine. In court Wednesday, Toebbe waived his right to a detention hearing and was ordered to remain in custody. But attorneys for his wife, who‚Äôs accused of aiding and abetting her husband, maintained their client‚Äôs innocence and contested an effort to keep her behind bars before the case goes to trial. FBI Special Agent Peter Olinits testified about the pains the couple took to maintain a low-profile during the ‚Äúdead drop‚Äù deliveries. He said they wore hiking clothes to blend in, disabled their phones‚Äô location services and parked far enough away from the drop-off sites to check if they were being followed. Olinits said the couple was paid $100,000 in untraceable cryptocurrency, a fraction of the $5 million sum Toebbe allegedly sought. That money, he said, still hasn‚Äôt been recovered. A search of the couple‚Äôs Annapolis home found $11,300 in cash, a specialized wallet for cryptocurrency, and a ‚Äúgo bag‚Äù containing a laptop computer and latex gloves, Olinits said. He said authorities also found a trash bag filled with shredded documents of sensitive data. The agent cited a letter Jonathan Toebbe allegedly wrote in which he expressed a willingness to flee the country at a moment‚Äôs notice. He also pointed to conversations the couple allegedly had over an encrypted messaging app, in which they discussed plans to leave the country. READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall ‚ÄúI have considered the possible need to leave on short notice,‚Äù read a message left on the memory card at one of the drop-offs. ‚ÄúShould that ever become necessary, I will be forever grateful for your help extracting me and my family.‚Äù The FBI did not name the country that had allegedly been approached by Jonathan Toebbe to buy the documents. Olinits said the agency is looking into whether any other foreign governments may have been sought out to buy the top-secret information. He also said the government has yet to recover all of the classified documents they believe Toebbe allegedly stole. Under cross examination, Olinits acknowledged besides surveillance images of Diana Toebbe at three of four ‚Äúdead drop‚Äù locations, investigators did not have concrete evidence proving that she had access to sensitive data or knew about everything her husband ‚Äúwas up to.‚Äù Federal prosecutors argued that Diana Toebbe was complicit in the plot. If released, they said, she poses a flight risk and has the potential to obstruct justice by altering or destroying evidence. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have any evidence of this stuff, of her knowing what her husband was up to,‚Äù defense attorney Edward MacMahon said, calling the government‚Äôs arguments ‚Äúpurely speculative.‚Äù MacMahon insisted his client was unaware of what her husband was doing. He said messages the government intercepted about her wanting to leave the country referred to her dislike of then-President Donald Trump and were not about evading law enforcement. The defense proposed freeing their client on bond under the conditions that she is on home detention with active monitoring and that she does not have access to the internet. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not going to flee the United States and leave her children, who need her, here,‚Äù MacMahon said. ‚ÄùThat‚Äôs not going to happen.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Vaccinations For Younger Children Could Be Approved Next Month; The Latest On Outbreaks In Maryland Schools As 7 Children Hospitalized U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Trumble did not make an immediate decision on Diana Toebbe‚Äôs status Wednesday, saying he would consider the attorneys‚Äô arguments and issue a written ruling later.

In the Mountain West, #22 San Diego State pits its top-flight run defense against Air Force‚Äôs own version of the triple-option. Colorado State faces Utah State.

Anytime Ole Miss is involved, the number that is expected to be on the scoreboard looks more like a slot machine than a football game. But I do think that we saw some pretty darn spirited defense by Ole Miss last week against Tennessee. And while the numbers didn‚Äôt show it, I think LSU is also capable of playing good defense.

Can Wake Forest handle that triple-option offense of Army? ‚ÄúThe good news for Wake Forest is they had an extra week to get ready for it. They did not play last week. And so when you get a couple of weeks to practice for it, it becomes a little bit less the albatross that it is in just a couple of padded days in practice, because it‚Äôs a very assignment-oriented game when you‚Äôre playing triple-option offense. Your eyes have to be in the right place. And then you have to trust what you see. If your eyes get a little bit lost and you start getting in places where you‚Äôre trying to what I call put on a cape and make plays that aren‚Äôt your plays, you‚Äôre going to get made to look foolish.

Federal health officials are investigating to determine whether other onions and suppliers are linked to this outbreak. An estimated 1.35 million Salmonella cases occur annually in the US, with about 420 deaths, according to the  CDC . Infection usually happens by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. Onions last year  were also the cause of a salmonella outbreak that infected 640 people from more than 40 states. Also last year, at least 55 people became sick in 12 different states after a salmonella outbreak was linked to  dried wood ear mushrooms , the CDC said.

Jonathan Toebbe, a Navy nuclear engineer, and his wife, Diana, were¬† arrested in West Virginia this month. ¬†Prosecutors allege that Jonathan Toebbe tried to pass secrets about sophisticated and expensive¬† Virginia-class submarines ¬†to someone he thought was a representative of a foreign government but who was actually an undercover FBI agent. The government accuses Diana Toebbe of serving as a lookout for her husband at several ‚Äúdead drop‚Äù locations at which sensitive information was left behind. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The couple  pleaded not guilty  in federal court in Martinsburg, West Virginia to espionage-related charges that carry life in prison. The Toebbes have been jailed since their arrests. The country to which Toebbe was looking to sell the information has not been identified in court documents and was not disclosed in court during a detention hearing Wednesday. A judge heard arguments but did not immediately rule on whether Diana Toebbe should continue to be locked up. Jonathan Toebbe waived his right to a detention hearing, meaning he continues to be held. Peter Olinits, a Pittsburgh-based agent specializing in counterintelligence investigations, testified in support of the government‚Äôs argument that Diana Toebbe was a potential flight risk and should remain jailed as the case moved forward. He described how agents on the day of the couple‚Äôs arrest found in their home, among other objects, $11,300 in cash, children‚Äôs valid passports and a ‚Äúgo-bag‚Äù containing a USB flash drive and latex gloves. Olinits also cited messages from 2019 and 2020 in which the Toebbes discussed leaving the country, including one in which Diana Toebbe said, ‚ÄúI cannot believe that the two of us wouldn‚Äôt be welcomed and rewarded by a foreign government.‚Äù Months later, in another message, she said, ‚ÄúI think we need to be actively making plans to leave the country,‚Äù according to Olinits. But Diana Toebbe‚Äôs lawyer, Edward MacMahon, raised the possibility that his 45-year-old client, who worked as a teacher at a progressive private school in Annapolis, Maryland, was simply referring to her distress over the prospect of President Donald Trump‚Äôs reelection. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not the only liberal that‚Äôs wanted to leave the country over politics,‚Äù MacMahon pointed out. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct, isn‚Äôt it, sir?‚Äù READ MORE:  President Joe Biden Addresses Several Issues During Thursday Night's Town Hall The investigation began in late 2020 after an FBI legal attache office in an unspecified country obtained a package that prosecutors say Jonathan Toebbe had sent that nation. In a letter, he offered to sell confidential U.S. Navy information, according to prosecutors. The letter, sent on April 1, 2020, and bearing a return address in Pittsburgh, says: ‚ÄúIf you do not contact me by December 31, 2020 I will conclude you are uninterested, and will approach other possible buyers,‚Äù according to Olinits‚Äô testimony. After receiving the letter, the FBI began using an undercover agent to communicate with Jonathan Toebbe, arranging for the information to be deposited at ‚Äúdead drop‚Äù locations around the region. Olinits testified that Diana Toebbe accompanied her husband on three of the four missions. To avoid suspicion, Olinits said, the Toebbes would dress as if tourists or hikers and meander around the drop site. Authorities say Jonathan Toebbe left at the locations memory cards containing government secrets, concealing them in objects including a chewing gum wrapper, a Band-Aid wrapper and a peanut butter sandwich. Olinits said the FBI has not been able to locate the roughly $100,000 in cryptocurrency payments that the bureau sent the Toebbes in exchange for the stolen government secrets, and that agents have also not yet recovered all the classified documents. MacMahon, the lawyer for Diana Toebbe, argued that because the FBI did not record any of the couple‚Äôs conversations, agents actually had no proof that his client had any knowledge of her husband‚Äôs activities or what precisely he was doing. He said the couple, who has children, had been planning a family trip, which could explain the bag that agents found and why their passports were being renewed. And he suggested that Diana Toebbe, who has a doctoral degree in anthropology, has no knowledge of nuclear submarines. ‚ÄúDid it occur to you as part of your investigation that maybe Mr. Toebbe was telling her he was up to something other than espionage against the United States?‚Äù MacMahon asked.

READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. ‚ÄúThe vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland‚Äôs vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,‚Äù Hogan said. More than 3.96 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 14 to 668. Of those hospitalized, 494 remain in acute care and 177 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 553,593 total confirmed cases and 10,540 deaths. There are 3,979,681 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,257,802 doses. Of those, 4,033,644 are first doses with 4,062 administered in the past 24 hours.

A total of 308,786 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 386 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer‚Äôs booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September.

Aaron Rodgers is in his usual elite form leading a balanced Packers attack. Most recently they disposed of the Bears, who are still finding their way with Justin Fields. Elsewhere in the division, Kirk Cousins is making plays and generally giving the Minnesota Vikings a chance to win. Jared Goff, like the rest of the Detroit Lions, are stuck in football purgatory. Rolling into Week 7, the Packers face another favorable matchup, when the Washington Football Team comes to town. The Lions look for that elusive first win against the Rams in Los Angeles. And the Bears travel to Tampa Bay to face the defending Super Bowl Champion Buccaneers. The Vikings have a bye. READ MORE:  Bengals Visit Ravens With AFC North Lead On The Line SportsLine ‚Äòs  Larry Hartstein  breaks down NFC North matchups in Week 7. All times listed are Eastern. Washington Football Team @ Green Bay Packers, Sunday, October 24, 1:00 p.m. Since their opening week disaster, the Packers have reeled off five straight wins. Their recent owning of the Bears made it the third time in a row they‚Äôve opened the season 5-1. Next up is a Washington Football Team that was supposed to have one of the NFL‚Äôs best defenses. It hasn‚Äôt turned out that way. Now 2-4 after falling to the Kansas City Chiefs, Washington has allowed the most points and second-most yards of any team in the league. And if that weren‚Äôt enough, the injuries are starting to pile up. ‚ÄúWashington [is] completely decimated with injuries,‚Äù Hartstein said. ‚ÄúAntonio Gibson is playing hurt. McLaurin is playing hurt. They‚Äôre missing Scherff on the offensive line. And they‚Äôre giving up the most points in the league at 31 points a game. So traveling to Lambeau, you would think this is a great spot for the Packers.‚Äù And normally it would be. But the Packers, comfortably ahead in the NFC North, could have their eyes on something bigger. ‚ÄúThey have a massive game on deck, Thursday night football at Arizona,‚Äù Hartstein pointed out. ‚ÄúArizona will be 7-0 after likely demolishing Houston this week. So that is a tremendous look-ahead spot. And that‚Äôs really the main hesitation I have with laying the points.‚Äù Washington is capable of keeping the Packers honest, even if they don‚Äôt always show it. Taylor Heinicke has proved to be a competent playmaker filling in for the injured Ryan Fitzpatrick. And he has Terry McLaurin, one of the game‚Äôs best young receivers, to throw to. The defensive line, while disappointing so far, is capable of getting after Aaron Rodgers. Being capable and actually winning are two separate things, of course. Rodgers has continued playing at the level that won him MVP last season. And he‚Äôs experience enough to know a let-down game when he sees one. Davante Adams is averaging 14.5 yards per catch on his 46 catches, best in the league. And Aaron Jones is picking up 4.6 yards per carry so far in an offense that can also beat teams on the ground. AJ Dillon has also been productive. Detroit Lions @ Los Angeles Rams, Sunday, October 24, 4:05 p.m. READ MORE:  'Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!' On The Big Screen At M&T Bank Stadium Tonight Both Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff will get their first chance to play the team that traded them away this past offseason. Stafford, who toiled in Detroit for the first decade-plus of his career, is now leading the high-powered Rams offense. And his stats ‚Äî 306 yards per game, 16 touchdowns ‚Äî put him easily among the NFL‚Äôs top five passers so far this season. ‚ÄúMatthew Stafford, we are seeing what he can do in a great offense, averaging 9.3 yards per attempt, completing almost 70 percent of his passes,‚Äù as Hartstein sees it. ‚ÄúAgainst this Lions pass defense ‚Äî which is abysmal, giving up 9.8 yards per attempt, easily the worst in all of football ‚Äî even though this line is over two touchdowns, there‚Äôs only one way to play this game. You‚Äôre either laying it with the Rams or you‚Äôre staying off.‚Äù Goff started with the Rams and led them to a Super Bowl appearance in his five seasons there. But just as the Lions defense is outmatched, he doesn‚Äôt have much to work with on the offensive side either. ‚ÄúThey have had some competitive games, the Lions,‚Äù Hartstein noted. ‚ÄúAnd then everything fell apart Sunday against the Bengals, completely outclassed from start to finish. I feel bad for Jared Goff. He‚Äôs 0-13 when Sean McVay is not his coach. He has nothing around him in terms of wide receivers, [who] are all injured. T.J. Hockenson, the best target, is nursing an injury. He‚Äôll probably play through it, but will be blanketed by the Rams.‚Äù There‚Äôs little to suggest that the Lions can keep up with the Rams. Then consider that Goff will face a Rams defense that‚Äôs already tallied 18 sacks. It seems unlikely that Detroit will find their first win in Los Angeles. Chicago Bears @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sunday, October 24, 4:25 p.m. Tom Brady is having another MVP-caliber season at the age of 44. He‚Äôs averaging a league-leading 344 yards per game, with 17 touchdowns against just three interceptions. His counterpart, Justin Fields, who is half his age, is still learning the ropes in his rookie season. He‚Äôs passing for just 105 yards per game, with 2 TDs and 3 interceptions so far. While this will be the biggest age gap between starting quarterbacks that the NFL has ever seen, the gap in performance is what will affect the outcome of this game. It‚Äôs unfair to compare Brady and Fields at this point in their careers. And there is quite a difference in the offensive skill players they have at their disposal. ‚ÄúHe has so many weapons, when you look at Antonio Brown and Godwin and Evans,‚Äù said Hartstein of Brady‚Äôs receiving core. ‚ÄúAnd look how well Leonard Fournette is playing, not to even mention the tight ends they have. And on the other side, Justin Fields, the passing game just isn‚Äôt there yet. Under 200 yards the past two weeks. He‚Äôs not really on the same page yet.‚Äù Further highlighting the difference, one of Brady‚Äôs favorite weapons, tight end Rob Gronkowski, has been out recently with rib injuries. Fields will have the opportunity to make plays this week. The Bucs pass defense gives up 280.8 yards per game, which is one of the worst averages in the NFL. Tampa is also dealing with multiple injuries in the secondary. Cornerbacks Carlton Davis and Sean Murphy-Bunting are on injured reserve, while Richard Sherman suffered a hamstring injury early in last week‚Äôs game. Safety Antoine Winfield started off the week in concussion protocol. The Bears need to run to have any hope of success. With David Montgomery out with a knee injury, Khalil Herbert and Damien Williams have proved capable replacements. ‚ÄúBut the Bucs don‚Äôt let you run the ball,‚Äù Hartstein pointed out. ‚ÄúThey only give up 3.4 yards per carry. Most teams don‚Äôt even try to run the ball against the Bucs.‚Äù MORE NEWS:  Turgeon Still Hoping For Long Postseason Run At Maryland So what NFL picks can you make with confidence?

Ua Tribe¬† After last week‚Äôs blindside of voting out JD ‚Äì¬†Genie, Ricard, and Shan all feel pretty secure in their now three-way alliance‚Ä¶ so it seems. Genie, who‚Äôs been open about playing an honest game, announces to Ricard and Shan that she‚Äôll look for the newly hidden Beware Advantage. They all agree to be loyal to one another from here on out and keep no secrets‚Ä¶ but then again, this is ¬†Survivor . What would the game be if there was no lying or manipulating? Genie finds the Beware Advantage and immediately shares it with Shan and Ricard. But, since Brad (who‚Äôs already voted out) initially found this advantage, these three castaways already have the idea of what this Beware Advantage could mean. As mentioned in previous episodes, if one finds the Beware Advantage, which is ultimately a three-way Immunity Idol, they cannot vote until this Hidden Immunity Idol is activated. The only way the idol is activated is if the member from each tribe who owns the advantage says their secret phrase at the next Immunity Challenge. Knowing these consequences, Genie, Shan and Ricard found it risky to open the Beware Advantage just yet. They agree to keep it sealed for now, without any one of them claiming it‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶that is, until Genie goes off by herself.   Ouch‚Ä¶ü§≠  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/GKfaCdmZ75   ‚Äî SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 21, 2021 Mastermind Shan, and her sidekick, Ricard, came up with a plan to open the Beware Advantage/Idol without Genie‚Äôs consent. Knowing the risks, Shan opened the Beware Advantage and now has complete ownership of the Hidden Immunity Idol once activated. Reminder: she‚Äôs out of a vote until she knows both the Luvu and Yase tribe have found their thirds of the idol. But, let‚Äôs not forget, Shan did just snatch JD‚Äôs extra-vote advantage from last week‚Ä¶ Luvu Tribe Meanwhile, on the Luvu tribe, both Danny and Deshawn are aware of the fact that more men than women are getting voted out from the other tribes. Since the Luvu tribe still has never gone to Tribal, Deshawn and Danny are reconsidering their previous ploy of throwing the next Immunity Challenge. They want to control the numbers on their tribe, so this time, they include Naseer in this potential plan. Naseer, who‚Äôs pioneered his own game thus far, is hesitant yet flattered these men want to work with him.   That feeling when you‚Äôre included in tribe decisions! ü§©  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/Q8J3eo7vzr   ‚Äî SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 21, 2021 Yase Tribe There‚Äôs still a solid four left on the Yase tribe: Xander, Evvie, Liana and Tiffany. It seems like Evvie is still in the power seat. She‚Äôs not only made a strong alliance with both Liana and Tiffany, but Xander as well. Both Tiffany and Liana are onto her and Xander‚Äôs game and decide to take matters into their own hands‚Ä¶ literally. Because this is¬† Survivor, ¬†ethics are out the window. Tiffany and Liana make a bold move and decide to sneak through Xander‚Äôs bag while he‚Äôs gone. They find the confirmation they need as they‚Äôve rummaged through both his extra-vote and Hidden Immunity Idol notes. Pretty risky move if you ask me‚Ä¶ After strategizing with Evvie, Xander is motivated to build up the trust between him and Tiffany since he already feels he trusts her more than Liana. He then tells Tiffany about his Hidden Immunity Idol and includes the info about saying his secret phrase. But then, Xander got caught up in his own lie. He told Tiffany he had just found the idol that day, but Tiffany knew he shared his secret phrase aloud just a few Immunity Challenges back. Knowing he lied, Tiffany is now even more wary about Xander, and let‚Äôs just say, things aren‚Äôt looking good for him.   Never lie to a school teacher. üëÄ  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/ODwGeXpIha   ‚Äî SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 21, 2021 Immunity Challenge¬† Immunity is, once again, back up for grabs! In addition to Immunity, the first two tribes would win some much-needed tarps to keep them warm and dry. But, before the Immunity/Reward Challenge began, host¬† Jeff Probst , prompted the castaways to share a bit more about their¬† Survivor ¬†experience, as they‚Äôre already on Day 11. And, before we know it, we hear a series of secret phrases‚Ä¶ one after another. While speaking in front of all three tribes, Shan secretly slips in her phrase: READ MORE:  ‚ÄòSurvivor 41‚Äô Episode 3 Recap: Advantages Galore ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize this till now‚Ä¶ broccoli is just a bunch of small trees.‚Äù Followed by Xander, who then says his: ‚ÄúI truly believe butterflies are dead relatives saying hi.‚Äù This means that only one person from the Luvu tribe needs to say their wacky phrase to activate this three-way Hidden Immunity Idol. And, in perfect¬† Survivor ¬†editing fashion, we hear a confuzzled voice from the Luvu tribe‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused as a goat on astroturf.‚Äù It was Naseer who said the last phrase! We immediately get a flashback of Naseer finding the final third of the Hidden Immunity Idol all by himself at the Luvu camp. He says he gives all the credit to his daughter back at home. That‚Äôs because, before going on¬† Survivor , his daughter would hide Immunity Idols in the yard for him to find. Naseer was so proud she trained him well!   Photo Courtesy of CBS   The challenge itself was exhausting ‚Äì and without surprise, it was the Ua tribe who once again lost and now had to (once again) head to Tribal Council. But before Tribal, the first winning tribe, Yase, had to pick one person from Ua as well as another castaway, in general, to head to the¬† Survivor¬† Summit. They chose Shan and then Liana from their tribe to go on the journey together. Survivor Summit The two castaways had to trek for hours in hopes of gaining an advantage. While trekking, Shan and Liana connected on a more spiritual level, unlike we‚Äôve seen yet in this season. Shan opens up about her past and her journey of becoming a pastor. She explains how she hasn‚Äôt been this deep to anyone in the game, even with her own tribe members, Ricard and Genie. Shan instantly feels a connection and trust with Liana and wants to continue this game with her in the future. To solidify this trust, like in previous episodes, when it came to the ‚Äúrisk or reward‚Äù decision, Shan decided to ‚Äúsave‚Äù her vote so that Liana could gain an advantage. This was a big move for both Shan and Liana. The two seem all about working with each other in the future. And, the advantage? Yeah ‚Äì it was a good one! Liana gained the first ‚ÄúKnowledge is Power‚Äù advantage, which ultimately means she has a chance to steal anyone else‚Äôs advantage in the game. The only catch is, she must ask either the question ‚Äúdo you have an advantage‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you have an idol‚Äù one time, to one person. If she‚Äôs wrong about the person, she loses her advantage. But if she‚Äôs right, she‚Äôs got a new (and stolen) secret weapon. And, from the foreshadowing of this episode, we all know she‚Äôs got her eye on Xander. He better watch out! Tribal Council¬† And it was down to the final three‚Ä¶ left on the Ua tribe. That is, until one more person gets their torch snuffed. And, the decision wasn‚Äôt all that easy. While Shan was at the¬† Survivor¬† Summit, Ricard and Genie had plenty of time to manipulate one another. Ricard, who has been Shan‚Äôs strongest ally since Day 1, of course, lied to Genie and said he wanted Shan out. Genie, who‚Äôs been honest and onto Ricard‚Äôs sneaky game, knows this isn‚Äôt true, though. Simply put: these two were both not interested in working with one another. So, when Shan arrived, they all took turns ‚Äúpitching‚Äù to each other on who should be the next person voted out. While Genie shared with Shan how Ricard was throwing her under the bus, Shan began to feel paranoid. Some drama did happen between both Shan and Ricard regarding the possession of the extra-vote advantage. It was some heated ‚Äì¬†and quite entertaining drama to watch between the two. But through it all, it‚Äôs the trust that carries you to the end. Ricard and Shan stayed strong and once again controlled the vote. Genie‚Äôs torch was snuffed this week ‚Äì just shy of reaching the (potential) merge.   Photo Courtesy of CBS   AH, this season is nuts ‚Äì¬†in the best way.

The Delta variant is still causing positive cases, albeit at a reduced rate, and President Biden has more strongly pushed to encourage vaccines. The broad economy has returned to where it was in early 2020, though shortages and inflation persist. Still, some people haven‚Äôt caught up. Unemployment exceeds pre-pandemic levels, even with jobs widely available in certain sectors. The federal unemployment bonus ended over a in early September, but millions of people remain short of food and behind on bills. A fourth stimulus check would help.

The third round of relief payments started back in March, courtesy of the American Rescue Plan (ARP). Over the following months, about  169¬†million people  received up to $1,400 each.

The  Conference Board  forecasts continued though slower growth through the rest of the year. The country‚Äôs  gross domestic product  (GDP), an estimate of economic activity across the U.S., has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. By that general measure, the economy has fully recovered. Broad segments of the workforce have endured little economic hardship during the pandemic. Many jobs performed at a desk in an office are just as easily performed at a desk in someone‚Äôs home. And with fewer places to spend money during much of the pandemic, plus three stimulus checks, many Americans saved more than they might have otherwise. The personal saving rate ballooned to 33.7 percent in April of 2020 and has remained well above pre-pandemic levels ever since. In August of 2021, it sat at  9.4 percent , still above the 8.3 percent from February of 2020, the month before the pandemic started. On  Face the Nation  back in June, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan  estimated  that its customers had not spent 65-70 percent of their last two stimulus checks. That extra savings combined with pent-up demand likely helped drive the broader economy during the rebound. The  housing market  has also surged, thanks to low interest rates and people stuck at home realizing the limitations of their living space. The National Association of Realtors recently reported that the national median sales price for an existing home hit $352,800 in September, up 13.3 percent from September of 2020. Much of that rise was helped along by houses priced above the median. Housing inventory decreased over August, and was down 13 percent year over year. And of the homes that sold in August, 86 percent were for sale for less than a month. The stock market continues to perform well too. Despite some bumpy weeks, the Dow Jones remains far above where it was at this time last year. It has regularly approached record territory. The market opened Thursday morning at 35,520 as compared to 28,210 at this time a year ago. Concerns about the Delta variant and lagging vaccination rates in parts of the world still linger. Overall COVID  case numbers  continue to fall, but mask guidelines remain more stringent in some places. The Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) full approval of the Pfizer vaccine, along with the approval of booster shots for those at risk or over 65 yeas old, has been good news for the market. Individual investors who saved their stimulus cash remain invested. Bigger investors continue to bet on a strong economic recovery in the months ahead. While certain experts foresee some of the strongest economic growth in decades, many are also concerned about higher inflation. Recent projections indicate that prices will rise about  5.3 percent  in 2021. That‚Äôs compared to the 2.3 percent rate in 2019 and 1.7 percent rate in 2020.¬†The latest data shows prices rising 5.4 percent over the last 12 months. Should that rate persist for the rest of the year, it would be the highest in three decades. Prices moved up 0.4 percent in September, matching early-summer highs. Core consumer prices ‚Äî excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile ‚Äî rose 0.2 percent. Rising prices continue for many products that require semiconductors, including new cars, computers, and TVs. Price hikes and product shortages stem, in part, from the economy opening up all at once. Prices depressed by the pandemic have had to normalize. But companies couldn‚Äôt keep pace with a year‚Äôs worth of pent-up consumer demand. They also have had to revive and retool their supply chains in the midst of drastic changes in consumer demand patterns. And this has all happened as shipping issues and other constraints continue to slow production and delivery. COVID has altered how and what people consume. The way these changes continue to play out isn‚Äôt necessarily predictable. However, companies have had to guess where demand for their product will be when all the dust settles. Predicting the future is hard enough in a normal economy. It became much harder in an economy trying to move past a pandemic then forced to deal with a resurgence. Price changes and shortages across a whole range of products will likely continue to plague consumers well into 2022. But economists think they should improve with time. Consumer spending  remains strong, with the rate up 0.7 percent in September, as compared to a 0.9 percent rise in August. Demand for clothing and sporting goods continues to rise. Spending on food and household supplies stayed high. New car purchases continue to be a drag, with semiconductor shortages still creating production and supply issues. Overall, goods spending remains above pre-pandemic levels. No Economic Recovery For Others The pandemic has further highlighted the growing imbalance across the broader economy. While many households have financially flourished during COVID, many others have fallen behind where they were in early 2020. Much of the gap depends on whether wage earners could work remotely during the shutdown or had public-facing jobs that required them to be on-site. Financial insecurity is still widespread, and the loss of a job and the loss of hours were some of the main reasons over the course of the pandemic. Nine percent of American adults (approximately 20 million people) reported a  shortage of food  in their household over the previous week, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of U.S. Census survey data from late September. Approximately 14 percent of renters (10.3 million people) have fallen behind on their rent, including 21 percent of renters with children in their household. The federal  eviction moratorium , which ended October 3, didn‚Äôt forgive rent that was owed, it pushed the debt into the future. And  evictions continued  in some parts of the country regardless. Meanwhile, only a fraction of the $46 billion Congress allocated for rental assistance has actually made it to tenants and landlords. As of late September, over a quarter of American adults (63 million people) reported some difficulty keeping up with expenses in the prior week. Employment also remains below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate fell to  4.8 percent  in September, with some workers finding jobs or leaving the workforce. Job growth continues to not meet expectations. Forecasters expected roughly 490,000 new jobs in September, but employers only added about 194,000. (August saw about 366,000 new jobs, also well short of expectations.) Many fear the rise of the Delta variant is hindering growth. Low-wage jobs made up the bulk of those lost during the pandemic, and while plenty of openings have returned, many remain unfilled. Approximately  290,000 people  initially applied for unemployment insurance in the week ending October 16. (A typical pre-pandemic week saw about 250,000 new unemployment applications.) As of the week ending October 2, almost 3.3 million workers were receiving some form of unemployment aid. (The approximately 4.9 million people previously collecting PUA  lost benefits  on September 6, when the program ended.) Many jobless Americans never received unemployment insurance and other government benefits, because of long waits, perceived ineligibility and other issues. Job growth still faces some headwinds, aside from the Delta variant. Some have argued that overly generous benefits made unemployment more attractive than working. But other considerations factor into one‚Äôs ability to work too. Remote schooling created childcare issues for many parents that summer break didn‚Äôt change. The resumption of in-person learning, if it lasts, could free up some parents to return to work. The full vaccination rate is  57.1 percent  for the country. But state percentages range from 70.6 percent in Vermont to 40.9 percent in West Virginia. Many counties across the country have vaccination rates lower than that. The threat of COVID, particularly the now-dominant Delta variant, is still real in places. Many people are uncomfortable working in public around strangers. A gap between labor force skills and job requirements can make hiring more difficult, not to mention the rising standards of what workers will accept in a job. And then there‚Äôs the general friction that inevitably arises when an entire economy slams its foot on the gas. As before the pandemic, many who are willing to work cannot find jobs with the wages and benefits they need to survive. According to  Marie Newman , a U.S. Representative from Illinois, ‚Äúthere is not a shortage of Americans looking for work, there is a shortage of Americans willing to work for starvation wages with no benefits, no health care, and no protections during a pandemic.‚Äù About half of all states tried to force the issue and push people back into the job market. These states, most led by Republicans, discontinued the $300  federal unemployment benefit bonus  for their citizens ahead of the official Labor Day end date, or at least attempted to. Analysis from a payroll services company called  Gusto  showed that cutting off federal benefits didn‚Äôt lead to  more hiring . The federal unemployment bonus and the previous round of stimulus checks helped Americans still awaiting their recovery to pay bills and put food on the table. The advance Child Tax Credit provides some additional support to families. But this money only goes so far. And some politicians feel that the payments haven‚Äôt been enough. Support For A Fourth Stimulus Check A group of Democratic Senators, including Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, sent a  letter to President Joe Biden  at the end of March requesting ‚Äúrecurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions.‚Äù As the Senators reasoned in their letter, ‚Äúthis crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. Families should not be at the mercy of constantly-shifting legislative timelines and ad hoc solutions.‚Äù An earlier letter to  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris  from 53 Representatives, led by  Ilhan Omar  of Minnesota, carved out a similar position. ‚ÄúRecurring direct payments until the economy recovers will help ensure that people can meet their basic needs, provide racially equitable solutions, and shorten the length of the recession.‚Äù Additional co-signers included New York‚Äôs Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan‚Äôs Rashida Tlaib, two other notable names among House Progressives. The letter didn‚Äôt place a number on the requested stimulus payments. But a tweet soon after put it at $2,000 per month for the length of the pandemic.   $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic is over.  https://t.co/6tuia6prFJ   ‚Äî Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN)  January 28, 2021 A  May 17 letter  from members of the House Ways and Means Committee renewed the push for additional stimulus. ‚ÄúThe ARP‚Äôs $1,400 checks alone will keep 11 million people out of poverty this year, with UI (unemployment insurance) expansion and other provisions in the bill accounting for the another five million. A fourth and fifth check could keep an additional 12 million out of poverty. Combined with the effects of the ARP, direct payments could reduce the number in poverty in 2021 from 44 million to 16 million.‚Äù READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School There‚Äôs also been talk about  automatic payments  that could be sent when specific economic metrics reach certain thresholds (for example, if unemployment rises to 6 percent). These triggers would make stimulus checks a reactive force in countering economic dips, sparing struggling Americans from Congressional delays. A majority of Americans also favor recurring relief payments. According to a January poll from  Data For Progress , nearly two-thirds of all voters support $2,000 monthly payments to all Americans for the length of the pandemic. Supporters include a majority of Independents and Republicans. A struggling restaurant owner‚Äôs  online petition  calling for $2,000 monthly payments for every American adult has surpassed 2.9 million signatures. The  Urban Institute  estimated that another stimulus payment could reduce poverty by at least 6.4 percent in 2021. Many economists are also onboard. A 2020  open letter  from experts in the field argued ‚Äúdirect cash payments are an essential tool that will boost economic security, drive consumer spending, hasten the recovery, and promote certainty at all levels of government and the economy ‚Äì for as long as necessary.‚Äù California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a  budget  into law in July, which includes a stimulus check for about two-thirds of the state‚Äôs residents. The $100 billion California Comeback Plan, as part of their  $262.2 billion budget , is paying $600 to residents earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year. Residents in that income range who have kids are receiving $1,100. Those checks  started going out  the last Friday in August The state‚Äôs previous stimulus went to those with an annual income under $30,000. Other states have also authorized payments.  Maryland handed out  $300 or $500 checks to those who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on their tax returns.  Florida gave  $1,000 bonuses to teachers, which started showing up in August. Denton and Irving school districts in  north Texas  were scheduled to give retention bonuses of $500 and $2,000 respectively at the start of the school year. The Biden administration also planned to give a one-time  $600 payment  to farm workers and meatpacking workers. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the plan in early September. The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated up to $700 million for the limited-scope stimulus check. The aid will be handed out through state agencies and include a pilot program giving extra money to grocery store workers. The Biden administration, which authored the third round of stimulus checks, isn‚Äôt against a fourth round. But the president recognizes their high price tag. He also has other priorities, specifically infrastructure and help for families. Neither the American Jobs Plan nor the American Families Plan, the administration‚Äôs original infrastructure and human infrastructure proposals, included another relief payment. Other plans currently bouncing around Congress don‚Äôt either. A Fourth Stimulus Check Is Unlikely All of the tacit and explicit support for stimulus checks keeps the possibility alive. The support doesn‚Äôt make a fourth payment likely, however. And there are many reasons why. Vaccinations are progressing steadily, albeit not as quickly as in the spring. Adults and those at least 12 years old are eligible to be inoculated in all 50 states. (Emergency approval for children ages 5-11 is expected soon.) Three different options are available to the public, with the Pfizer vaccine fully approved by the FDA. Booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine have also been approved and rolled out for those at risk or over 65. Actually putting needles in arms is taking time, even with supply readily available. Americans have received over 410 million doses, with 66.1 percent of the population having received at least one dose and 57.1 percent completely vaccinated. Vaccination numbers continue to increase at a rate of about 700,000 doses per day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its guidance and recommends that vaccinated people in areas with higher COVID transmission revert to wearing  masks indoors  again. With vaccinations rising, the nation‚Äôs economy continues to recover. Looser restrictions have helped businesses, and jobs are available in many sectors. Many industries are even complaining of worker shortages, which are leading to wage increases. The number of new unemployment claims remains lower than it has been for much of the pandemic. In September,  consumer confidence  dropped again due to ongoing concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices.  Consumer sentiment  is also subdued due to the Delta variant, supply chain questions, and ongoing labor force issues. Confidence, however, remains higher than it‚Äôs been for much of the pandemic. Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the country‚Äôs economy. And excess pandemic savings, along with three stimulus checks, has boosted people‚Äôs spending power. That spending power has increased even more since monthly Child Tax Credit payments started on July 15. The most recent payment went out October 15. An improved financial position generally also raises optimism for the future. The ongoing vaccinations, which have allowed the economy to reopen to some degree, certainly help. All that additional spending, along with the release of pent-up demand, has led to the availability of more jobs as companies try to hire to address consumer needs. With the economy growing, a fourth round of stimulus checks seems less urgent. Aside from the generally improving economy, the political machinations of Washington make a fourth stimulus check a longshot. The American Rescue Plan, which included the third stimulus check, passed along party lines. Republicans were not interested in spending anywhere close to $1.9 trillion, though some did support the third relief payment. They termed the package a ‚Äúblue state bailout,‚Äù claiming it went well beyond the scope of COVID and would increase the deficit, leading to inflation. The Democrats used a process called  reconciliation  to pass the bill in the Senate without Republican support. That allows budget-related matters to proceed with a simple majority rather than the filibuster-proof 60 votes. Generally only one reconciliation bill can pass per fiscal year. But a subsequent ruling by the  Senate parliamentarian , who interprets the legislative body‚Äôs rules, opened up a path for additional spending legislation. Without reconciliation, any bill would need at least 10 Republican votes, along with every Democratic vote. But the Biden administration has other priorities. One of its biggest is addressing infrastructure. The proposed  American Jobs Plan , which aimed to rebuild roads, repair bridges, do away with lead pipes, extend broadband, modernize the country‚Äôs electric grid and much more, carried a price tag of $2.3 trillion. Biden and a group of Senators from both parties agreed upon a scaled-back infrastructure plan costing about $1 trillion. The resulting bipartisan bill, now called the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , passed the Senate in early August. Neither the original version nor the bipartisan bill that moved forward includes a fourth stimulus check. One could, in theory, be added when the House takes up the bill. That seems unlikely given the price tag. The American Families Plan, focused on childcare, education and more, would have cost another $1.8 trillion in its initial form. The Democrats are now pushing forward a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that focuses on their various ‚Äúhuman infrastructure‚Äù initiatives, such as Medicare expansion, child care, and climate change. A fourth stimulus check is not included, though one could theoretically still be added as well. The Democrats‚Äô extended plan is a more likely home for a fourth stimulus check than a traditional infrastructure plan. Funding these plans will almost certainly involve tax increases on corporations and wealthy individuals, which Republicans would oppose. Plenty more negotiating seems inevitable before any bill gets passed into law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised not to take up the infrastructure bill until the Senate also passes the human infrastructure bill. Democrats are already laying the groundwork to use reconciliation again to push through this legislation. Joe Manchin  of West Virginia, among the most centrist Democratic Senators, has warned against overusing reconciliation. He is also apparently unwilling to do away with the filibuster, which would lower the number of votes needed to pass legislation to 51. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema doesn‚Äôt want to abandon the filibuster either. Manchin also wants to see the human infrastructure bill shrink. With bipartisanship still hard to come by, the Biden administration is in a tough spot. They‚Äôre unlikely to add a fourth stimulus check to any plan, driving up the price tag by hundreds of billions of dollars. They‚Äôre also unlikely to use reconciliation to pass another stimulus check on its own. What Other Aid Is Out There? While a fourth stimulus check is improbable, more direct payments to Americans have already been signed into law. Up until Labor Day, the jobless received extended unemployment benefits. The American Rescue Plan also includes an advance Child Tax Credit. Under the revised Child Tax Credit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is paying out $3,600 per year for each child up to five years old and $3,000 per year for each child ages six through 17. Monthly payments of up to $300 per child started July 15 and will continue through December of 2021. The remainder is to be issued when the recipient files their 2021 taxes. The benefit does not depend on the recipient‚Äôs current tax burden. In other words, qualifying families will receive the full amount, regardless of how much ‚Äî or little ‚Äî they owe in taxes. Payments start to phase out beyond a $75,000 annual income for individuals and beyond $150,000 for married couples. The more generous credit will apply only for 2021, though Biden has stated his interest in extending it through 2025. The ARP added $21.6 billion to the  Emergency Rental Assistance Program , which is being distributed to state and local governments, who then assist households. Most of the $46 billion total has yet to reach tenants and landlords. The infrastructure and human infrastructure plans also have the potential to create many jobs across a wide swath of the economy. How the proposed initiatives are ultimately distributed across the bipartisan bill or the broader Democratic plan remains to be seen. The American Families Plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave that could have reached as high as $4,000 per month, depending on a worker‚Äôs income. It also boosted the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and placed a ceiling on the cost of childcare for many families. The plan set aside $200 billion for universal preschool. In addition to helping working parents pay for childcare, the plan sought to allow more parents to return to the workforce. Look for similar programs and more when the specifics of the human infrastructure plan are worked out. Additional money in people‚Äôs pockets from any bill or proposed plan is still hypothetical, of course. Nothing has found its way through Congress yet. And it could be months until it does.

(AP)  ‚Äî Mark Andrews takes a lot of pride in the position he plays. That was obvious when he was asked if he feels like a wide receiver trapped in a tight end‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúNah man, I‚Äôm a tight end,‚Äù he said Wednesday. ‚ÄúEspecially, it‚Äôs national tight end day, I think, this Sunday, so I‚Äôm excited about that.‚Äù READ MORE:  Three Maryland Cities Among 'Top 100 Best Places To Live In America' And how is he planning on celebrating that particular holiday? ‚ÄúGoing off.‚Äù If Andrews indeed has a big game this weekend, that wouldn‚Äôt be much of a change. The Baltimore standout has been one of the AFC‚Äôs top pass catchers so far this season, helping Lamar Jackson and the Ravens overcome a slew of injuries en route to the conference‚Äôs best record. Andrews has 34 catches for 468 yards on the season, ranking in the top 10 in the AFC in both categories. His stats are remarkably similar to those of Travis Kelce, the reigning All-Pro at the position. Before the season, Andrews agreed to a four-year, $56 million contract extension, and since then he‚Äôs shown just how important he is to this offense. Pro Football Focus currently gives Andrews the highest offensive grade of any NFL tight end, ahead of Kelce, George Kittle, Rob Gronkowski and other big names‚Äìalthough as Andrews points out, there‚Äôs a long way to go. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of work left to be done. The job is not finished yet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, there‚Äôs really only one thing that I care about, and that‚Äôs at the end of the season.‚Äù The Ravens drafted Andrews in the third round in 2018, and before this season, he was already the first tight end in team history to have multiple seasons of at least 700 yards receiving and seven touchdown catches. After getting his big extension, he had a quiet game in a season-opening loss at Las Vegas. Since then, Andrews has had at least five catches in every game‚Äìand Baltimore has won all five of them. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School In a Monday night win over Indianapolis on Oct. 11, Andrews had 11 receptions for 147 yards, both career highs. He also caught two fourth-quarter touchdowns and two 2-point conversions, helping the Ravens force overtime. It was a memorable night on national television for Jackson and Andrews. Jackson, Baltimore‚Äôs star quarterback, said he could sense during the offseason that Andrews was ready for a big year. ‚ÄúHe was getting after it in Arizona when we were working out,‚Äù Jackson said. ‚ÄúHe just wants to be the best, and that‚Äôs what you need out of your players. Your tight end‚Äìwhatever position they play‚Äìyou want the best out of them, and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs shown.‚Äù It‚Äôs been particularly important for Andrews to be at his best because of all the pressure on Baltimore‚Äôs passing game, which ranked last in the NFL last season. The Ravens drafted receiver Rashod Bateman and acquired receiver Sammy Watkins in an effort to give Jackson more help, but Bateman missed the first five games because of groin problems, and when he finally did play last weekend against the Chargers, Watkins was out with an injury. Throw in injuries to running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, and the Ravens have needed Jackson to be productive throwing the ball‚Äìwhile relying significantly on the same top pass catchers as last season. Jackson and Andrews have been up to the task. In fact, their connection looks even better in 2021. ‚ÄúHe understands this offense so well,‚Äù Andrews said of his quarterback. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always had great ball placement and great eyes, but just the way he‚Äôs seeing the game, the game is progressing. It‚Äôs slowed down to him a bunch.‚Äù NOTES: The Ravens got another TE back Wednesday when they designated Nick Boyle (knee) to return from injured reserve. He was on the field at practice.

The FBI confirmed Wednesday afternoon that suspected human remains were found, along with a backpack and notebook belonging to Petito‚Äôs fianc√©, Brian Laundrie, in Florida‚Äôs Carlton Reserve. READ MORE:  Three Maryland Cities Among 'Top 100 Best Places To Live In America' According to a CBS News report, the remains were said to be ‚Äúa small part of a body,‚Äù which would make it difficult to make a positive ID and to determine a cause of death. ‚ÄúThese items were found in an area that up until recently had been underwater. Our evidence response team is on scene using all available forensic resources to process the area,‚Äù said Michael McPherson, the FBI‚Äôs special agent in charge. Anything found also has been exposed to the elements. ‚ÄúIt could be because the environment has changed and several weeks ago it didn‚Äôt look the way it looks now because of the water,‚Äù former senior FBI profiler Mary Ellen O‚ÄôToole said, adding, ‚Äúand the critical point is going to be, what is the condition of these items? Do they appear to have been out there for a long time? Are they weathered?‚Äù ‚ÄúUltimately, DNA analysis will be able to tell us if it is Brian Laundrie or not. Remember that they took reference samples from the home so that they could do this DNA comparison,‚Äù said Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensic scientist with John Jay College. Kobilinsky says the evidence discovered could also be crucial to the Petito murder investigation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested to know about that notebook, whether there is any information in there that might have referenced Gabby Petito and perhaps give us a little more information as to how she died,‚Äù he said. Earlier Wednesday, attorney Steven Bertolino said Laundrie‚Äôs parents, Chris and Roberta Laundrie, along with law enforcement, started searching Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in North Port, Florida. ‚ÄúThe FBI and NPPD were informed last night of Brian‚Äôs parents‚Äô intentions and they met Chris and Roberta there this morning. After a brief search off a trail that Brian frequented, some articles belonging to Brian were found. As of now, law enforcement is conducting a more thorough investigation of that area,‚Äù Bertolino said, in part.   UPDATE: Items of interest were located at the Carlton Reserve this morning in connection with the search for Brian Laundrie.  An  #FBI  Evidence Response team is processing the scene. The reserve is closed to the public and no further details are available at this time.  @FBIDenver   pic.twitter.com/itOYRpY6fp   ‚Äî FBI Tampa (@FBITampa)  October 20, 2021 READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School Now there are new questions about why his family came forward just now, and items were suddenly found, CBS2‚Äôs Dick Brennan reported. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it interesting that hundreds of searchers went through this preserve for more than a month and then the family, which has not cooperated much at all, suddenly contacts police and says we plan to go out there and look for him,‚Äù criminologist Casey Jordan said. ‚ÄúThe parents have engaged in behavior that is suspicious and that has to be resolved, and I think that it ultimately will be in terms of whether or not they provided any kind of assistance to their son,‚Äù O‚ÄôToole said. Bertolino was asked why the parents didn‚Äôt ask to go help search in the park sooner. ‚ÄúThe parents had assumed that the experts, the FBI and all the tracking teams that they had would be able to locate Brian based upon the information that we had provided to them, to the specific areas and trails in the park that Brian liked to visit,‚Äù he said. Bertolino says the park had been closed to the public and there was no reason for the Laundries to go anywhere else. As for the Laundries‚Äô silence and lack of cooperation throughout the investigation, Bertolino says they were following his legal advice. Brian Laundrie, who went missing five weeks ago, is currently the sole person of interest in the death investigation of Petito, a 22-year-old native of the Suffolk County hamlet of Blue Point. Petito was found dead in a forest in Wyoming back on Sept. 19, and a coroner later ruled her death a homicide by strangulation.

(AP)  ‚Äî Maryland coach Mark Turgeon has a roster that in many ways reflects the new normal in college basketball. His leader in minutes last season left early for the NBA. Another starter departed as a transfer. But the Terrapins added several transfers of their own, and with Eric Ayala and Donta Scott returning, it will be up to Turgeon to make sure this group of players forms a good mix. READ MORE:  Three Maryland Cities Among 'Top 100 Best Places To Live In America' ‚ÄúThe (transfer) portal was good for us last year. The year before it wasn‚Äôt quite as good for us. It‚Äôs part of our game,‚Äù Turgeon said. ‚ÄúWe want to blend it. We still want to sign some high school players, but we want to make sure we can add players to make us good.‚Äù Maryland went 17-14 last season, and the Terps were every bit as inconsistent as that record suggests. They won at Illinois but lost at Northwestern and Penn State. They reached the NCAA Tournament and beat Connecticut before bowing out in a blowout loss to second-seeded Alabama. The Terps have won at least 23 games in five of the last seven seasons, missing the NCAA Tournament only once in that span‚Äìnot counting the year the event was called off because of the coronavirus pandemic. But Maryland has reached the Sweet 16 just once under Turgeon and hasn‚Äôt gone further. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a blessed guy,‚Äù said Turgeon, who is entering his 11th season as the team‚Äôs coach. ‚ÄúAt some point, I‚Äôm going to be blessed enough to make a run in the NCAA Tournament. We‚Äôve been really consistent.‚Äù The Terrapins have to replace guard Aaron Wiggins, who started 30 games last season before leaving for the NBA draft. Guard Darryl Morsell transferred to Marquette. Maryland welcomes several transfers to the fold this year, including forward Qudus Wahab from Georgetown and guard Fatts Russell from Rhode Island. PRESEASON RANKING The Terrapins are ranked No. 21 in the preseason AP Top 25, the fifth-highest team in the Big Ten. TOP HOLDOVERS The 6-foot-5 Ayala is back after leading the team with 15.1 points per game last season. Scott, a 6-foot-7 forward, also returns after averaging 11 points and a team-high 5.9 rebounds. READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School DIFFICULT OFFSEASON Scott‚Äôs childhood home in Philadelphia was recently destroyed by Hurricane Ida. Around $60,000 was raised to help his family recover. ‚ÄúTerp Nation stepped up through a GoFundMe, did great things for their family,‚Äù Turgeon said. ‚ÄúReally proud of our fan base and what they were able to do.‚Äù Scott said the response amazed him. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to be that big of a number,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust seeing that people were willing to give, it meant more than money.‚Äù RIVALRY The Terrapins dropped three games against Big Ten champion Michigan last season, and their matchups turned contentious at times. An altercation involving both coaches during a Big Ten Tournament game led to the ejection of Michigan‚Äôs Juwan Howard and a technical foul on Turgeon. The fact that Wolverines star Hunter Dickinson is from the Washington, D.C. area only adds to the intrigue. Michigan does not play at College Park this season, but the Terps visit the Wolverines on Jan. 18. SCHEDULE The rest of Maryland‚Äôs schedule includes a Dec. 1 home game against Virginia Tech, a matchup with Florida in New York on Dec. 12 and a trip to the Bahamas in late November. No. 7 Purdue, the other Big Ten team in the preseason top 10 along with No. 6 Michigan, doesn‚Äôt come to College Park either. The Terps open the season against Quinnipiac on Nov. 9.

He would also reiterate the importance of federal support for community- and public health-driven solutions to violence in American cities, a topic the mayor said he discussed with Biden during a conversation several months ago. The mayor also said he would lobby for ‚Äúpathways for folks re-entering into our society for the jobs that are going to be created by the American Jobs Act and the Build Back Better Plan.‚Äù Biden‚Äôs  appearance at Baltimore Center Stage  comes as Democrats are  pushing  to pass the president‚Äôs  $3.5 trillion domestic agenda  to strengthen the social safety net. The bill, known as the Build Back Better Act,  would  provide two years of free community college, child care assistance and universal Pre-K, expand Medicare and the child tax credit, and combat climate change, among other policies. The president has  told progressive House Democrats  the price may need to lower the price tag to between $1.9 and $2.2 trillion in order to secure enough votes in the Senate.

There‚Äôs no point in downplaying it. READ MORE:  Three Maryland Cities Among 'Top 100 Best Places To Live In America' ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something to this game,‚Äù tight end C.J. Uzomah said. ‚ÄúIt is a huge game, and we‚Äôre not treating it like a normal game.‚Äù After five straight losing seasons, the Bengals have a chance to move into a tie for first atop the AFC North if they can win at division-leading Baltimore on Sunday. Yes, the season is less than half over, but for a Cincinnati team with young standouts at quarterback and receiver, this is a chance for the Bengals to see how they measure up against the team with the conference‚Äôs best record. And a team that has dominated the Bengals of late. The Ravens have won five in a row in this series, and the past three haven‚Äôt been close. Baltimore beat Cincinnati 49-13 in their second meeting of 2019, then swept the Bengals last season without allowing a touchdown. The Ravens won 27-3 and 38-3, and in the most recent matchup between the teams, Baltimore rushed for a franchise-record 404 yards. This season‚Äôs Ravens have won five in a row after opening with a loss at Las Vegas. A win this weekend would give coach John Harbaugh‚Äôs team a two-game cushion at the top of the division. A loss, however, would give the Ravens some surprising company in first place. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more important than division games, especially division games at home,‚Äù Harbaugh said. ‚ÄúWe understand that.‚Äù This is Baltimore‚Äôs first division game of the season. The Bengals already have a win at Pittsburgh. Much of the attention on Cincinnati is focused on second-year quarterback Joe Burrow and rookie receiver Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase, both of whom went to LSU. Chase is fourth in the NFL with 553 yards receiving. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually been really surprising. He‚Äôs really made the NFL look pretty easy,‚Äù Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey said. ‚ÄúIt seems like being that Joe and him played in college together, it‚Äôs not really a new relationship. So, it seems like they‚Äôre like a fifth-year tandem, that they‚Äôve been doing it for a while.‚Äù The Bengals (4-2) have had success on the other side of the ball as well. Cincinnati has not allowed more than 25 points in a game this season. The Ravens have eclipsed that mark four times, including last weekend in a 34-6 rout of the Chargers that gave Baltimore a marquee win over another AFC team that was off to a good start. ‚ÄòTHE RIGHT TRAJECTORY‚Äô READ MORE:  Memorial Service Announced For Elijah Gorham At Mervo High School The Bengals have already equaled their win total for all of last season. They finished 4-11-1 in 2020 after slogging to a 2-14 record in coach Zac Taylor‚Äôs first year in 2019. Taylor said the overall improvement is evident everywhere. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing well on the road the last two weeks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve responded well to adversity so far. And so again, those are all things that are going to serve us well the rest of the season. You know, I‚Äôm always going to sit here and say there‚Äôs things we can improve, but I think our guys are on the right trajectory right now, and that‚Äôs encouraging to see.‚Äù HEALTH UPDATE Injuries have been a constant backdrop for the Ravens, ever since they lost running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards before the season even began. This week, they put offensive lineman Ronnie Stanley (ankle) on injured reserve. He hadn‚Äôt played since the opener. Receiver Sammy Watkins (thigh) missed last weekend‚Äôs game, and running back Latavius Murray hurt his ankle. A BETTER BURROW Taylor said Burrow is better than he was when he was beaten 27-3 by the Ravens in Week 5 last season. The rookie threw an interception and was sacked seven times by Baltimore. ‚ÄúI think Joe has grown tremendously,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been exposed to a lot more defenses over the course of the year, just having played and watched more tape over this last season.‚Äù Burrow is completing more than 70% of his passes and has at least two touchdown passes in each of the Bengals‚Äô first six games. NEVER BEFORE The Ravens are 5-1 for the fourth time in franchise history, but they‚Äôve never started 6-1. Baltimore was 5-1 as recently as last season, then dropped four of its next five games. BIG TARGET With Watkins and receiver Rashod Bateman both having missed time, the Ravens have leaned heavil y on tight end Mark Andrews. The 6-foot-5 Andrews has 468 yards receiving, tied with Kansas City‚Äôs Travis Kelce for the top mark among NFL tight ends.
