(WJZ) —  A robbery suspect was found dead early Monday after a pursuit and shootout with Baltimore County Police in Woodlawn, authorities said.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Police said two suspects were trying to lose police when their vehicle was involved in a hit-and-crash crash near Dogwood Road and Gwynn Oak Avenue. That’s when police believe the suspects bailed out. An officer came across one of the suspects near the corner of Englewood Avenue and Gilmore Street and the pair traded gunfire, according to police. Police said K-9 units found one of the suspects dead nearby a short time later. It wasn’t immediately clear Monday afternoon how the suspect died. A firearm believed to be linked to the case was recovered from the scene. The officer was hurt during the shootout, but his injury was not a gunshot wound. He was taken to an area hospital for treatment. Based on a preliminary investigation, police believe only one officer fired his agency-issued firearm during the exchange of gunfire. Police said the officer, whose name was not released, has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is routine for officer-involved deaths.

Heavy police activity in the area Monday morning had neighbors, like Woodlawn resident Stephanie Perry, concerned. “I seen police cars in my neighborhood, so I was just wondering,” Perry said. “Not being nosy, but I live here and I was concerned, so I came out.” Others shared concerns about damage to bystanders’ property, including a damaged pickup and car spotted near the scene of the hit-and-run. “It’s very unfortunate that it happened to very innocent people like that, with their cars and vehicle damaged,” Lochearn resident Gabriel Nnamchi said. Baltimore County Police are asking anyone with information about this case to come forward. “We would ask anyone in the community, if you see anything suspicious or come across something, to please contact us immediately,” spokesperson Joy Lepola said.

He said children were crying and many were afraid the two dogs owned by the injured man died in the fire. The two dogs were recovered on Monday and no other injuries have been reported. As the smoke clears, what is left is humbling. “Then once the fog stopped, about two hours later, you could see it from the corner down there. All you could see was just a skeleton of the house, that was it,” said Farlow. A man in the house next door, Henry Schwartzman, told WJZ he was knocked from his couch. “Over there I’m sitting, and the boom knocked me off the sofa,” he said. He ran through the house to get his wife. “I see smoke, flames and fire just shooting up so we got out right away.” To see his neighbor’s house now, Schwartzman said, “that one looks just like this, three bedrooms, garage, living room, utility room, kitchen, bath.” MORE NEWS:  'He Was A Young Man Full Of Promise': Mervo High School Mourns Loss Of Football Player Elijah Gorham Updates on the cause will be released by the State Fire Marshal whenever they have completed their investigation.

Jackson threw for a career-high 442 yards and four touchdowns, including a pair of short TD passes to Mark Andrews in the fourth quarter as the Ravens rallied from a 25-9 deficit. Andrews also caught the two 2-point conversions during that furious comeback. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The Ravens had to withstand a 47-yard field goal attempt by Rodrigo Blankenship on the final play of regulation, but the Indianapolis kicker missed, sending the teams to overtime. The Ravens had their record-tying streak of 43 straight 100-yard rushing games snapped, and it looked like they were in big trouble after Jackson fumbled near the goal line in the third quarter. But after that turnover, Baltimore scored a touchdown on each of its final four possessions. The Indianapolis kicking game was a big reason the game got to overtime. Blankenship missed an extra point in the third quarter, and with the Colts up 25-17, he had a 37-yard kick blocked by Calais Campbell with 4:29 remaining, giving the Ravens a chance to tie the game.

Then the star quarterback flipped a 2-point conversion pass over the middle to Andrews to tie it. The Colts (1-4) made it back into field goal range, with the help of an unnecessary roughness penalty on Baltimore’s Tavon Young with 13 seconds left, but Blankenship’s kick sailed wide left. Carson Wentz threw for a career-high of his own, 402 yards and two touchdowns. Jonathan Taylor scored on a 76-yard swing pass early in the first quarter, then added a rushing touchdown in the third as the Colts took a 22-3 lead. The Ravens (4-1) took over sole possession of first place in the AFC North after Cleveland and Cincinnati lost Sunday. The first half was fairly uneventful, but the Ravens started and finished it poorly. On third-and-15, Taylor took a swing pass, slipped into the Baltimore secondary and outran everyone for a touchdown just 2:01 into the game. There was no more scoring until late in the second quarter, when the Ravens settled for Justin Tucker’s 23-yard field goal. The Colts had enough time to drive back the other way, and after converting on fourth-and-11, they set up for a field goal. The kick was missed, but Baltimore’s Marlon Humphrey had jumped offside.

Leonard ran it back to about the Indianapolis 25-yard line, then lateraled to Isaiah Rodgers, who went the rest of the way for an apparent touchdown. It was ruled a forward lateral after a review, so that part of the play was negated, but the Colts still got the ball and quickly drove for a TD. Taylor’s 4-yard run made it 22-3. Jackson threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Brown late in the third. HONORED The Ravens inducted DT Haloti Ngata into their Ring of Honor at halftime.

(WJZ) —  A Navy nuclear engineer and his wife are set to appear in federal court in West Virginia on Tuesday to face accusations that they tried to sell military secrets to a foreign government. Jonathan and Diana Toebbe, both of Annapolis, were  arrested over the weekend on a federal complaint charging them with conspiracy to communicate restricted data and communication of restricted data  in violation of the Atomic Energy Act. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The couple were taken into custody Saturday in West Virginia where authorities say Jonathan Toebbe dropped off a memory card containing sensitive data for someone he thought was a foreign agent but was actually an undercover agent. Toebbe, 42, a nuclear engineer employed by the Department of the Navy, has spent more than a year trying to slip restricted data on U.S. nuclear submarine design to a foreign power, with his wife’s help, according to a copy of the complaint. “The information he was trying to convey was very, very important, and, if gotten into the wrong hands, would have been very damaging to the United States,” said Michael Greenberger with the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security. No comment from the Navy on Toebbe’s arrest was immediately available Sunday, the Associated Press reports. The complaint alleges the efforts began in April 2020 when a representative for an undisclosed foreign country received a package containing Navy documents, a letter expressing a desire to sell confidential information and contact instructions. “I apologize for this poor translation into your language. Please forward this letter to your military intelligence agency. I believe this information will be of great value to your nation. This is not a hoax,” the sender, known as “Alice,” wrote in part. The package and its contents were handed over to the FBI in December, at which point an undercover agent posing as the foreign government’s representative responded to the sender through an encrypted email. “The husband calls himself an amateur,” Greenberger said. “But he was pretty sophisticated with what he was doing.” It wasn’t until February that the pair made contact with each other. From there, they traded a series of emails over the next several weeks in an effort to establish trust and come to an agreement over payment and delivery methods. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The email dialogue culminated on Memorial Day Weekend with the FBI placing a signal for “Alice” at a location associated with the foreign government. Days later, the undercover agent sent $10,000 in cryptocurrency to “Alice” as a show of good faith. Afterward, the pair arranged what would become the first in a series of “dead drops,” which involve leaving something hidden in a public location for another person who stops by and collects it after the fact. The first dead drop was made June 26 in Jefferson County, West Virginia. Authorities later recovered a memory card with sensitive data that had been placed inside a peanut butter sandwich, and “Alice” was paid $20,000. The cloak-and-dagger routine continued with a July 31 dead drop in Pennsylvania with a memory card stored in a bandage and another Aug. 28 in Virginia with Virginia-class submarine schematics stored on a memory card hidden in a pack of gum. “I have considered the possible need to leave on short notice,” read a message left on the memory card at the Aug. 28 drop. “Should that ever become necessary, I will be forever grateful for your help extracting me and my family.” On multiple occasions, the complaint states, Dianna Toebbe was seen with or near her husband at the drop-off sites, apparently acting as a lookout. According to the complaint, Toebbe was seeking a total of $5 million for dozens of deliveries. Neighbors was surprised by the scene they saw at the Toebbes’ Annapolis area home over the weekend. “Saturday afternoon, streets were blocked with cars–FBI coming in and out,” neighbor Jennifer McCormick said. “It’s like a movie.” Diana Toebbe, 45, is listed as a teacher at The Key School, a prestigious private school located in Annapolis. In a statement Sunday, the school said she has been suspended indefinitely pending the outcome of the investigation.

Experts said Sunday that outdoor trick-or-treating — particularly for children who are vaccinated — should be fine this year. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “It’s a good time to reflect on why it’s important to get vaccinated. But go out there and enjoy Halloween as well as the other holidays that will be coming up,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday. Dr. Megan Ranney, associate dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, cautioned against indoor Halloween parties for children too young to be vaccinated and encouraged parents in areas with high virus transmission to mask their children, but agreed that Halloween fun could go on this year. The big picture for  Covid-19 in the US  is looking a little brighter as new infections and hospitalizations decline. The average rate of daily new cases has dropped below 100,000, to 93,814 as of Sunday, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University.  Fauci said he would like to see new daily cases well below 10,000, but the decline is a start. “Hopefully it’s going to continue to go in that trajectory downward,” he said. While conditions are improving and the sense of normalcy is expanding, Fauci warned that the fight against the pandemic is not over. “We have to just be careful that we don’t prematurely declare victory in many respects. We still have around 68 million people who are eligible to be vaccinated that have not yet gotten vaccinated,” Fauci said. About 56.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Although experts don’t know the exact percentage of vaccination coverage needed to control the spread of the virus, Fauci has said the “vast majority” of the population will need to get vaccinated. “We’re not there yet,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said. “This virus can continue in those places where vaccination rates are low.” The potential for spread is especially concerning as winter holidays — often accompanied by gatherings and travel — approach. Health experts have promoted vaccination requirements for air travel this holiday season; and while Fauci declined to offer his stance on the matter Sunday, Professor of Emergency Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University Dr. Esther Choo weighed in. “Now is the time for mandates for airlines,” Choo said. “It should happen quickly because people are making plans right now for our fall and winter holidays.” Here’s when vaccines could be available for the youngest kids The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering a proposal to expand vaccines to children as young as 5, and those younger may not have a dose authorized for them until early next year, former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said Sunday. The FDA is likely to ask for more data and perhaps for studies involving more children, because it is a new vaccine and a new virus, Gottlieb told CBS’s Face the Nation. “And that could push it into 2022. Previously we had talked about trying to have that data available before the end of this year, which could have prompted an authorization perhaps by the end of the year, at least in kids ages 2-4. I think that it’s more likely that it slips into the first quarter of next year at the very least, but not too far into next year,” said Gottlieb, who is also on Pfizer’s board. The FDA has called a meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), for October 26 to discuss pediatric vaccines. Pfizer has submitted data and a formal request for authorization for its one-third dose vaccine for use in children 5-11. But Gottlieb said he expects VRBPAC to also discuss what might be needed for authorization for the youngest children. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Having more information to consider can raise public confidence in the vaccines, Gottlieb said. He is already confident and plans to vaccinate his own young daughters. “There’s a lot of parents like me that, as soon as the vaccines available for their children, are going to go out and get their kids vaccinated, that see the benefits of vaccination,” he said. “There’s a lot of parents who still have a lot of questions around vaccination. I think for them, they should have a conversation with their pediatrician to try to get comfortable with the idea of vaccinating kids.” Gottlieb said he thinks it will be years before the CDC recommends making Covid-19 vaccines part of the regular childhood vaccination schedule, which would open the door to school districts mandating them. “I think it’s a very long way off. Certainly, CDC’s going to look at children ages 12-17 differently than 5-11,” he said. What we know about the long-term impacts of Covid-19 It’s important for people to understand “not dying from Covid is a great thing, but that isn’t the only metric we should be using,” Michigan emergency room physician Dr. Rob Davidson said Saturday. He said at his hospital, some Covid-19 patients have been on a ventilator for more than a month, and some have endured invasive procedures to stay alive. Even if they recover physically, some Covid-19 survivors end up suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, due to time spent in the ICU, Davidson said. A study published in February found  30% of Covid-19 survivors experienced PTSD , which is a psychological illness that usually occurs after someone has a life-threatening experience. The virus can also have negative effects on pregnant people infected during their third trimester and their babies,  research shows . Between March and September of last year, symptomatic pregnant people at one Israeli hospital had higher rates of gestational diabetes, a lower white blood cell count, and experienced heavier bleeding during their delivery. Their babies also experienced more breathing problems, a research team reported in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine. The study has limitations since it only looked at women in one hospital, so its findings may not be true for all people who are pregnant. Then there is long Covid — when symptoms can last months after infection. A  large study published last month  showed more than one-third of Covid-19 patients suffered symptoms three to six months after getting infected. Some had multiple, long-lasting complications. Breathing problems, abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were among the most common issues reported. Accompanying  data showed as many as 46% of children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 22 had experienced at least one symptom  in the six months after recovering.

Translated: Every 40 seconds, someone in the world takes their own life. That’s a sobering statistic to ponder today, on 2021’s World Suicide Prevention Day. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Suicide rates have been climbing for years in some parts of the world. In the United States alone, suicide rates have increased by 35% between 1999 and 2018. The  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  calls suicide a “growing public health problem.” Experts fear suicidal thoughts  may escalate due to economic hardship and mental stress caused by another lethal crisis facing the world — COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A leading public health group estimated last year that as many as 75,000 Americans could die due to drug or alcohol misuse and suicide connected to the pandemic. President Joe Biden expressed his concern in a  proclamation released Thursday  announcing that September 10 is World Suicide Prevention Day in the US. “In 2019, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and the second leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 10 and 34,” Biden wrote. “And that was before the COVID-19 pandemic compounded, for many, feelings of isolation, exhaustion, and economic and public health-related anxieties. Increased rates of depression have sparked concern that we will see a further increase in suicide rates.” A study released in June further highlights those fears. The CDC found emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts started to increase in May 2020 among adolescents ages 12 to 17, especially girls. “The mean weekly number of these visits was 26.2% higher during summer 2020 and 50.6% higher during winter 2021 compared with the corresponding periods in 2019,” the CDC researchers wrote. Widespread risk All ages, races and income levels are at risk, with 77% of all suicides occurring in lower- to middle-income countries,  according to WHO . Globally, youth can be hardest hit: Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15- to 19-year-olds around the world, the agency said. And that’s only part of the grim picture. For each person who has died by suicide, many more people think about or attempt suicide,  according to the CDC . In 2019, 12 million American adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.5 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.4 million attempted suicide. “If you or a loved one are thinking about suicide, please know that you are not alone and help is available 24/7 by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK or through the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741,” Biden wrote. “Next July, the new Mental Health Crisis Line 9-8-8 will take effect. By expanding the crisis line and investing in our Nation’s crisis care infrastructure, we have the opportunity to prevent suicides and save lives,” he continued. There are ways each of us can help prevent suicide. Here’s how to do your part. Recognize distress signals There are many risk factors that can lead to an increase in thoughts about taking one’s life. It’s important to recognize these in yourself or a loved one, experts say, because many people do not talk about their thoughts of suicide in advance. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Is there a history?  People who have a mood, anxiety, alcohol or other substance use disorder, a major physical illness or a history of trauma, abuse or suicide in their family are at higher risk,  according to the CDC . Was there a loss?  A death in the family, the loss of a job or the loss of a relationship is a risk factor for suicidal behavior, especially if they feel isolated or alone without social support, the  American Foundation for Suicide Prevention  says. Economic distress is a reality facing millions who are out of work right now due to Covid-19-related job loss, social isolation or quarantine. Is there a belief system that honors personal sacrifice?  People with religious or cultural attitudes that see suicide as a noble resolution of a personal dilemma are at higher risk,  according to the Suicide Prevention Lifeline . Can they get a gun?  Research has shown that  easy access to firearms  is also a key risk factor. Did the person survive a suicide attempt?  Any previous suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor, according to the WHO. But there is also an odd “copycat” phenomena where suicides increase after local clusters of suicide or deaths of famous celebrities reported in the media. For example, deaths  by suicide rose by 10%  in the US after comedian Robin Williams ended his life in 2014. Look for actions Again, not everyone will give their friends and loved ones verbal hints about their suicidal thoughts. That’s why it’s important to look at  actions as well as words  to recognize warning signs. According to the  National Institute of Mental Health,  be wary if your loved one:   Increases their use of alcohol or drugs or starts to behave recklessly, such as driving while intoxicated or without a seat belt.   Has extreme mood swings, from euphoria to the depths of depression or appears agitated, expresses rage or talks about seeking revenge.   Sleeps too much or too little or withdraws or isolates from others.   Appears to be in unbearable psychological pain or talks about being hopeless or a burden to friends or family, or talks about feeling trapped or having no reason to live.   Begins to search online for ways to kill themselves, such as buying a gun or obtaining medical prescriptions.   Begins to give away prized possessions or visits or calls to say goodbye.   Be sure to regularly check on loved ones. During the pandemic families and friends are more isolated and alone and many warning signs may be tough to recognize. Listen carefully when you talk to them about to their concerns and observe how they are expressing themselves. If you are having suicidal thoughts If you live in the US and are having suicidal thoughts, call the  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  at 800-273-8255 (800-273-TALK) for  free and confidential support . It’s open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For crisis support in Spanish, call 888-628-9454. TrevorLifeline, a  suicide prevention counseling service for the LGBTQ community , can be reached at 866-488-7386. Befrienders Worldwide  connects users to  the nearest emotional support center  for the part of the world they live in. Crisis Text Line , which Biden mentioned, is an international service that provides a live, trained crisis counselor via a simple text for help. The first few responses will be automated until they get a counselor on the line — which typically takes less than five minutes. If you are in the US or Canada, text 741741. If you are in the UK, text 85258 and those in Ireland can text 50808. The National Health Service also  lists a variety of resources on its website .

New coach Kevin Stefansky reorganized that talent and led Cleveland to 11 wins and their first playoff appearance in almost 20 years. In the Wild Card round, the Browns downed the Pittsburgh Steelers, who they had already lost to twice during the regular season. They then fell just short of topping the Super Bowl-bound (and then reigning Super Bowl champion) Kansas City Chiefs. Expectations are much higher in Cleveland this season. And the Browns aren’t going to surprise anyone, least of all their Week 1 opponent. The Chiefs, behind Patrick Mahomes, advanced past that Divisional Playoff win over the Browns to the Super Bowl. But their second consecutive appearance did not result in their second consecutive win. On Sunday, Kansas City will start what could be yet another Super Bowl run on Sunday at home against Cleveland. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts Stefansky has turned the Browns into a legitimate contender in just a season. “To Kevin Stefansky the team is bigger than any one individual,” according to former NFL coach and studio analyst on  The NFL Today  Bill Cowher. “It isn’t about how many touches I get here, how many touches I get there. Kevin Stefanski is about building a culture.” “No one’s bigger than the team,” Cowher continued. “And I think if he takes it one game at a time until he really accomplishes something. There’s a simplicity about Kevin Stefanski…  Coaching is about bringing people together, it’s about identifying what your strengths are, and, more importantly, the ability to mask what your weaknesses are. But to have people embrace the roles that they have. And I think that’s the one thing, that he has brought is humility to that football team and unselfishness to that football team.” The Browns have quality players across the lineup. And that starts with Baker Mayfield at the quarterback position. “I think he’s a terrific thrower of the ball,” said studio analyst on  The NFL Today  Phil Simms. “He moves around well. He’s got a great first move out of the pocket, throws extremely well on the run. And he has that quality. He’s got a photographic memory, from what I understand, and he’s just kind of a natural leader. I think players gravitate towards him. He grew up last year, we saw the real talent that he is.” The offense that Stefansky built, or imported from the Minnesota Vikings, gives Mayfield some flexibility, without the pressure to make things happen on his own. Cleveland was third in the NFL in rushing last season behind Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. The pair combined for 18 touchdowns and over 1,900 yards on the ground. That legitimate ground threat helped in the play-action as well. Hunt hauled in 38 catches out of the backfield. Wide receiver Jarvis Landry had 72 catches of his own, even after Odell Beckham’s injury made him the focus. Beckham’s return enhances a Browns offense that could use his speed and play-making ability, but already knows how to put up points. “Odell Beckham is going to return to this team hungry but humbled,” said  The NFL Today  studio analyst Nate Burleson. “This isn’t the same Odell Beckham from years ago, rocking the number 13 in New York City, acting like a rock star. This is an individual who’s coming off his second significant injury and knowing he’s joining a squad that did it without him and almost beat the Chiefs without him.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University The Browns should be able to put up points this week, but can they stop the Chiefs from doing the same? The upgraded defense promises to be one of the NFL’s more physical units. That starts with defensive end Myles Garrett, who has the potential to be Defensive Player of the Year. He’s bookended by new arrival Jadeveon Clowney, with tackle Malik Jackson another new addition. Linebacker Anthony Walker steps into the middle of the Browns defense, and safety John Johnson bolsters the secondary. “They’re loaded on defense,”  The NFL Today  studio analyst Boomer Esiason pointed out. “They can pass rush, they got a good secondary, and they finally got the right coach doing the right things and getting the best out of their young quarterback.” Will Mayfield be able to keep up with his counterpart Mahomes? It may very well depend on whether the Chiefs new-look  offensive line  can hold off the Browns’ pass rush. The old unit’s failure to protect Mahomes in the Super Bowl is a big reason the team made offensive line an offseason priority. They signed Center Austin Blythe and guards Joe Thuney and Kyle Long in free agency. The Chiefs traded away their first-round pick for left tackle Orlando Brown Jr. and then drafted center Creed Humphrey and guard Trey Smith. Lucas Niang steps in at right tackle after opting out of last season. If the offensive line comes together, the Chiefs offense may actually improve this season, which is a scary thought for the rest of the NFL. Kansas City was the only team to put up over 5,000 passing yards last season. Tight end Travis Kelce hauled in 105 passes for 1,416 yards, the second most in the league. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill wasn’t far behind, with 87 catches for 1,276 yards. Both return, along with receivers Mecole Hardman and Demarcus Robinson, who also remain threats. Clyde Edwards-Helaire, who averaged 4.4 yards on his 181 carries, is also a pass-catching threat out of the backfield. The Chiefs’ high-powered offense has covered for their defense in recent seasons. The unit, while better against the run than the pass, allowed an NFL-worst 415.8 yards per game last season. The difference may have simply been a function of opponents playing from a deficit and having to pass more. This year’s defense may be a step up from last year’s, given a few offseason changes. Chris Jones slides over from defensive tackle to defensive end, possibly improving the pass rush. Second-round pick Nick Bolton steps in at linebacker, though fellow linebacker and second-round pick Willie Gay will be out until at least Week 4. Safety  Tyrann Mathieu  wears a lot of hats in this defense, and Daniel Sorensen led the team in tackle last season. Mathieu, however, remains on the team’s COVID list and could miss Sunday’s game.

Ideally, the US would get cases as low as possible, but a reasonable goal would be to get below 10,000 a day, he said. In mid-June, before the surge in cases driven by the more transmissible Delta variant, the US reached a seven-day average of about 11,000 new cases a day, according to Johns Hopkins University data. On Thursday, President Joe Biden outlined a plan that imposes stringent new vaccine rules on federal workers, large employers and health care staff — requirements that could apply to as many as 100 million Americans. “We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,” Biden said, his tone hardening toward Americans who still refuse to receive a vaccine despite ample evidence of their safety and full approval of one — the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine — from the US Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Todd Rice of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville called the move necessary. He said his hospital’s staff has been pushed to the brink and he worries about cases climbing in cooler months, which typically see higher rates of respiratory problems. “The key to getting out of this is to get people vaccinated,” Rice told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Friday morning. “We have to do something to try to increase our vaccination numbers.” Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital Of Philadelphia, said that Biden’s announcement was an important step and that he “put his finger right on what the problem is right now in this country.” And some experts pushed for more. “I loved the speech; I wish he had gone further. I wanted the president to restrict travel this holiday season to people who’ve been vaccinated,” CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said. However, many Republican governors — some in states with high hospitalizations and low vaccination rates — condemned the strategy. Some even said they would challenge the action in court. “To be clear: the vaccine is the best tool we have to combat the pandemic but heavy-handed mandates are the wrong approach,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said in a tweet Thursday. But even with both vaccination and mitigation measures in place, the endgame might not be complete eradication, said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “Basically, it’s going to end the day that we have achieved enough level of population immunity, that the virus essentially becomes a nuisance and no longer a threat,” Jha said Thursday. Vaccines still as effective against Delta variant, CDC says  Since Delta has been the dominant coronavirus strain, overall estimates of Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness are “similar to those during the months before Delta became predominant,” according to a study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Friday. The CDC analyzed thousands of Covid-19 hospitalizations among adults in nine states between June and August, beginning on the date the Delta variant accounted for more than half of sequenced cases in the state. The Moderna vaccine was the most effective in reducing hospitalization, the study found. Among all ages, the Moderna vaccine had a 95% effectiveness, while the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had an 80% effectiveness and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had a 60% effectiveness. Overall, vaccine effectiveness was lower among those age 75 and older, “which had not been observed previously” in this sample network. The study found vaccine effectiveness overall to be 89% among adults under the age of 75, but 76% among those age 75 and older. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn West Virginia is facing an all-pandemic high with 252 patients currently in the ICU and 141 patients on ventilators, Gov. Jim Justice announced in a news conference Friday. “We lost another 38 people since Wednesday. We’re going to continue to lose people in this surge without any questions,” the governor said. “A high percentage of the folks in the hospitals are unvaccinated.” How the US is tackling the virus  Changes to the Covid-19 response begin Friday, when the maximum fine for violating the federal requirement to wear a face mask when traveling will double to a range of $500-$3,000, up from $250-$1,500. And to help Covid-19 patients who are impacted by the Delta variant surge, the US is going to increase the availability of new treatments, including monoclonal antibodies, Biden said. He said the treatments “have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70% for unvaccinated people.” Also on Thursday, the New York Police Department confirmed Thursday that any employee who does not get vaccinated or provide proof of a recent negative Covid test will not be allowed to work and will not get paid. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also previously announced that any new hires for any New York City agencies will be required to be fully vaccinated. Having workers chose between vaccination or weekly testing will likely increase vaccination, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said Thursday. “It’s not convenient for most to get tested once per week,” he added. Data expected on children’s vaccines in the fall  The vaccination effort is largely aimed at US adults, but with school getting started around the country, many experts and parents are concerned about how children will be protected from the virus. Children have a lower risk of serious symptoms from Covid-19 but are not any less likely than adults to get infected in the first place, Fauci said in a New York Times interview released Thursday. “So, we’re seeing more children in the hospital now because the Delta variant is more readily transmissible among everybody — adults and children,” Fauci said. Throughout Florida’s 15 largest school districts, at least 34,085 students and 6,347 employees have tested positive for Covid-19 during the 2021-22 school year, according to a CNN analysis. In Kentucky, 39 of the state’s 171 public school districts have had to close at some point during the 2021-22 school year due to an increase cases, quarantines and/or staff shortages, Joshua Shoutla, a spokesman for the Kentucky School Boards Association told CNN in a statement Thursday morning. The Los Angeles Unified School District hopes to curb spread among students by requiring all eligible children to be vaccinated by the end of the calendar year, the school board of education decided in a unanimous vote. Children under the age of 12 are currently not eligible to be vaccinated. But those 12 and older can get the Pfizer’s vaccines under an emergency use authorization. According to a CNN analysis of the latest CDC data, about 43% of all 12- to 17-year-olds in the US are fully vaccinated. Data on Moderna’s vaccine for younger age groups will likely be ready in late October or early November, following Pfizer’s data which is expected by the end of September, Fauci told the New York Times. After the data are presented, Fauci said it is “very likely” the companies will apply for an emergency use authorization.

I am thankful for the citizens who identified him from video released by law enforcement and that the survivors are able to move forward after this senseless assault.” Officials said on Feb. 18, 2020, a woman called to report an assault that occurred earlier that day in the parking lot of Christopher’s Grocery Store Edgewater. She told officers while she putting back her shopping cart, a white male bumped into her and she then felt a pain in her buttocks. She said she jumped back and asked the man if he burned her with a cigarette. He responded with “Ya, it felt like a bee sting, didn’t it?” Once she was home, she observed a small red spot and what appeared to be a puncture wound on her buttocks. She said she also felt a wet substance on her pants after the assault occurred. Police reviewed the surveillance video which showed a white male walking up behind the victim, pulling something out of his pocket and pushing it against her.

The next day, the victim observed a large round red area on her buttocks where she was attacked and sought treatment at an area hospital. Stemen was identified by tips from the community and was arrested. A search warrant was obtained for the defendant’s residence and vehicle. During the search of the vehicle, officers found a large syringe in the driver’s side door that had an unknown liquid inside. There were additional syringes found in the defendant’s residence, including one syringe containing an unknown substance. Also recovered at the home was the same sweatshirt, pants and shoes that Stemen was seen wearing on the surveillance video. The syringes were sent to the crime lab for DNA analysis and police obtained a search warrant for the defendant’s DNA.

As case numbers fell and vaccination numbers rose, mask mandates eased, and people returned to offices. Life was moving toward some sort of new normal. It’s since become clear that the pandemic wasn’t ending so much as entering a new phase. The Delta variant has COVID case numbers climbing in parts of the country once again. Similar to the pandemic’s early days, certain regions are running out of beds in their ICUs. Most of the new cases and virtually all of the resulting hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated. Experts believe that mass vaccination combined with vigilant masking is the only realistic path out of the pandemic. Vaccination mandates are being implemented across various levels of government and the private sector. On Thursday, President Biden announced  broad vaccine requirements  with the potential to affect approximately 100 million Americans. When the federal government’s rules start hasn’t been determined. But the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA)  full approval  of the Pfizer vaccine for use in anyone at least 16 years old strengthened the legal ground on which it will be built. Some Republican governors have  promised to sue  the administration for the pending rules, claiming them to be unconstitutional. Cities And States Can Mandate Vaccines A  1905 Supreme Court case  upheld mandatory vaccination to end a smallpox epidemic in Massachusetts. The  Jacobson v. Massachusetts  ruling read, in part, “the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured A  second decision in 1922  called  Zucht v. King  confirmed the matter. In that case, the city of San Antonio, Texas was sued for excluding students who weren’t vaccinated for smallpox. The Supreme Court’s decision read, in part, “long before this suit was instituted,  Jacobson v. Massachusetts , had settled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination.” The history of our authorities implementing  public health measures  for the benefit of society dates back to colonial days. Quarantine laws, to prevent the spread of smallpox, existed back to the 17th century. States along the coast routinely required a ship’s sailors and passengers to quarantine onboard before coming ashore. New York City often required immigrants to be isolated when they arrived. To this day, tuberculosis patients can be forced to isolate until they finish their medications. Cities and states can mandate vaccines for their employees. And many already have.  New York Mayor  Bill de Blasio previously issued a mandate requiring all city employees to be vaccinated by September 13. Any of the city’s roughly 400,000 workers who don’t will be subject to weekly testing. Those who break the mandate can’t go to work and won’t be paid. The mayor mandated vaccinations for all school  teachers and staff  as well. California has a similar rule in place for its government workers. Effective last month, the state’s 238,000-plus government workers, along with its 2 million-plus healthcare workers,  must be vaccinated  or wear masks in a work environment. After the FDA’s full approval of the Pfizer vaccine paved the way, other city and state governments across the country have implemented or are considering similar measures. The  Los Angeles Unified School District , the country’s second biggest, will require all students 12 years of age or older to be vaccinated to attend in-person classes. Students must receive their first dose by October 3 and their second dose by October 31. Employees of the school district have to be vaccinated by October 15. The  Culver City Unified School District  was the first in the state to require student vaccinations. New York City has also instituted broader mandates on the local level. Customers and employees of indoor dining, fitness and entertainment establishments have to show  proof of vaccination . The rules started to phase in on August 16, with full enforcement by September 13. ( Broadway League , the theatre industry’s national trade association, previously announced that Broadway theatres must require attendees to be fully vaccinated.) While similar to mandates issued in France and Italy in July, New York City’s was the first in the United States. San Francisco implemented similar restrictions in public places on August 20. And countless individual establishments in  Chicago ,  Minneapolis , and across the country have their own requirements. Some states have moved in the opposite direction, banning agencies from requiring proof of vaccination. As of early September, 20 states have banned  proof-of-vaccine requirements  by legislation or executive order. Some of these laws date back months, to when the country was in a different stage of the pandemic. The laws tend to apply to state and local governments, rather than private schools and private employers, and only prevent requiring vaccine proof. State officials can still encourage vaccinations. Some laws are linked to the vaccines’ authorization for emergency use, meaning they no longer apply to the Pfizer vaccine. Federal Government Attempting National Mandate While cities and states have long had the power to implement vaccine mandates, it’s unclear if the federal government can. According to the  Congressional Research Service , a sort of think tank providing Congress with legal and policy analysis, “except in certain limited circumstances, including in the immigration and military contexts, no existing federal law expressly imposes vaccination requirements on the general population.” The federal government does have authority in certain areas that would support executive action to fight COVID. Congress could also effectively create a mandate by stipulating that states must require vaccines in order to receive certain types of federal funding. It seems the administration is going to test its authority. On Thursday the president  announced vaccine requirements  that could affect up to 100 million Americans. “It’s not about freedom or personal choice, it’s about protecting those around you,” Biden said in prepared remarks. For starters, all federal workers and on-site contractors must be vaccinated. The President had  previously stated  that masking, socially distancing, and regular testing would be an option. The civilian workforce, separate from the military, numbers over 2 million. Mandatory vaccinations are moving ahead for the additional 1.4 million  active-duty troops . The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is also developing a rule that would require companies employing 100 or more employees to mandate vaccinations among their workforce. That covers roughly 80,000 million Americans, by the government’s estimation. The unvaccinated would need a weekly negative test to work. Failure to comply would open up companies to a $14,000 fine per violation. The President’s announcement also included new vaccination requirements for healthcare institutions that accept Medicare and Medicaid and staffs at Head Start programs.   Today, I laid out my new plan to combat COVID-19 and boost vaccinations. Watch as Press Secretary Jen Psaki breaks it down:  pic.twitter.com/SJnjdfIjsA   — President Biden (@POTUS)  September 9, 2021 READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The move marks a clear shift for the administration. While the president strongly supports vaccines for anyone who is eligible and healthy enough, he didn’t previously think it was the federal government’s place to mandate them for citizens. The divided politics of the nation were likely a big reason why. A vaccination mandate may push some of those who are on the fence into receiving shots, but maybe not enough to make a meaningful difference. At the same time, it will harden the anti-vaccine position of all those who are against it. The move is already stirring up resentment among Republicans. Various state governors as well as the Republican National Committee have come out against the yet-unwritten rule. Republican Governors Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Brian Kemp of Georgia have threatened to sue, promising to “defend freedom” and “stop this blatantly unlawful overreach” respectively. Republican Governor Greg Abbott called the vaccine mandate “an assault on private businesses.” The president, for his part, seems resolute in the change of direction. “The bottom line — we’re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers.” Employer Vaccine Mandates Gaining Popularity To date, many employers do not require employees to be vaccinated. But it’s well within an employer’s rights, and plenty of high-profile companies have instituted vaccine mandates on their own. Disney, Google, Morgan Stanley, and Netflix are all on the list, not to mention many hospitals and healthcare systems.  Banner Health , Arizona’s largest healthcare system, mandated vaccinations for its employees, despite that state’s position on mandates. Many of the companies announcing mandates are comprised mostly of  office workers , who are largely able to work from home and largely reluctant to work alongside unvaccinated coworkers. They are also companies that has generally thrived during the pandemic. Companies that employ large numbers of manufacturing, warehouse and food service and production workers are less willing to require vaccines. They fear pushing away workers in what’s become a difficult market for hiring them. For that reason, the announcement from  Tyson Foods  requiring vaccines is particularly notable. All of the company’s employees must be vaccinated by November 1, with executives and office workers facing shorter deadlines. The nation’s largest meat producer employs 139,000 people, fewer than half of whom were vaccinated at the time of the August announcement. The company has endured multiple COVID-related shutdowns at its various processing plants throughout the pandemic. Workers have died of the virus, and families have sued the company for failing to take the necessary preventative measures. United Airlines , another company hit hard by the pandemic and the resulting shutdown of the travel industry, announced an employee mandate of its own. It was the first among airlines. All 67,000 domestic employees must be vaccinated five weeks after the FDA fully approves a vaccine, meaning five weeks from August 23. Those who fail to send an image of their vaccine card to the company will be terminated. (Certain health and religious exemptions will be allowed.) United has no plans to require vaccinations among passengers. Drugstore chain CVS updated its vaccine requirements shortly after the FDA announcement. All corporate and patient-facing employees have until the end of October to be vaccinated. Pharmacists have until the end of November. The President’s change of position is likely to spur other companies to act on their own, even before they’re compelled to by law. According to one  recent survey  of about 1,000 companies taken before the President’s announcement, 21 percent claimed to already have vaccine requirements, with 52 percent planning to implement one this year. Governments have offered everything from lotteries to scholarships to encourage vaccination. Companies have given their employees bonuses, gift cards, and paid time off. But vaccination rates have slowed from over 3 million per day to around a million, and COVID cases are steadily rising. With giveaways reaching the ceiling of their effectiveness, governments and businesses are taking a harder line. COVID Pandemic Continues Vaccine mandates will take effect in the coming weeks, and more will follow as additional cities, states, and private employers take up the mantle. Any of the roughly 80 million unvaccinated people who receive their first shot today and their second shot three weeks later won’t be fully protected until two weeks after that. And full FDA approval won’t cause many of the unvaccinated to rush out and get their first shot. Meanwhile, people will continue to be infected, and COVID case numbers will continue to rise. The  seven-day average  of new reported coronavirus cases has jumped to about 136,000 a day from under 12,000 three months ago. That’s still lower than January’s peak and the previous seven-day average. The full vaccination rate is  53.4 percent  for the country. But state percentages range from 68.4 percent in Vermont to 39.6 percent in Alabama. Many counties across the country have vaccination rates lower than that. And to state the obvious, the virus transmits within these smaller communities. Americans have received over 377 million doses, with 62.7 percent of the population having received at least one dose. Vaccination numbers continue to increase at a rate just under a million doses per day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had advised that the fully vaccinated could  forgo masks  and social distancing in most indoor and outdoor settings. Their revised guidance recommends that vaccinated people in areas with higher COVID transmission revert to wearing  masks indoors  again.

Returning to Brooklyn, The Barclay’s Center will be home to this year’s awards and fans will be back in attendance. MTV’s Dometi Pongo will be holding down the red carpet amongst other duties during the awards. CBS’ Matt Weiss caught up with Pongo for the inside scoop on this weekend’s awards. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW:  Dometi excited to talk to you today man! First of all, how did you get linked up with the  VMA s and what was your reaction when they came to you and offered you the opportunity? DP:  Ah man, I’ve been with MTV News since December 2018 and I was over the moon when I got the opportunity to work for the network that has shaped pop culture around me for so long. I grew up on the Sways and Suchin Paks and the Kurt Loders and the crazy thing about it I didn’t even have cable growing up. I used to have to run to a friend’s house in order watch MTV so it was an extra special treat. My first red carpet for MTV was the MTV Movie and TV awards; I’ve been addicted ever since. Some of the work that I do in journalism is so heavy. When you get a chance to talk about your favorite albums its a treat. MW:  You’re a huge music fan, who are some of your favorite artists that really influenced you growing up? DP:  Jay-Z. It’s almost cliche to say, he influences everybody. I’m really a fan of Jay-Z. There’s a rapper out in Philly, the Roots, Black Thought of the Roots who plays the house band for one of the late-night shows. I actually have a Black Thought tattoo on my arm says how much I love him. It says, “my journalistic range is a catalyst for change,” that’s one of my favorites. But as for those that are performing in the show, Polo G. a young artist from Chicago, who I’m glad to see has transcended drill music and is now making hits that transcend culture and got him to the  VMA  stage, so I’m excited to see that kid perform. I love Kacey Musgraves she’s premiering Star Crossed performing Sunday night. It’s a lot going on this week. MW:  You mention Jay-Z which brings things full circle. The  VMA s are taking place in New York this year. What does that mean to you to have that energy that the city provides? DP:  I think it’s particular significant that we’re back in Brooklyn, back at Barclays, the day after the 9/11 20th anniversary but also in a time when we’re dealing with COVID-19 and we’re figuring out a way to safely move forward. Everyone wants to get reacclimated and see what this new normal feels like. Beyond the show and the entertainment, there’s also this air of, ok how do we do this, what does work look like, what does fun look like, what do concerts look like. It’s great to know that all the folks here will be fully vaccinated. Talent, us folks backstage are getting tested every other day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Its’ significant on multiple levels especially because of everything New York has gone through. Right at the onset of the pandemic I was talking to first responders, and they went through a lot. This is kind of a homecoming for a lot of folks right now. This is going to be one of the biggest shows ever because not only are we commemorating 20 years since 9/11 but it’s also the 40th anniversary of MTV the brand, the network. We’ll be celebrating that. We’ve got to commemorate that. Then you have a personality like Doja Cat hosting. She is unhinged, unfiltered, hilarious, crazy, exciting, all of the things, hosting and performing. I think it’s going to be one for the books. MW:  What are you most excited about for your own role? What’s something you can’t wait to do on the night of? DP:  I’m looking forward to Chloe of Chloe x Halle step out on her own. It’s funny because she was a newer act. A lot of folks are probably more excited for the Foo Fighters and Billie Eilish; I’m excited for them as well, I love Billie. But I’m really excited to see Chloe come into her own and perform solo for the first time. Had a phenomenal performance in years past at the  VMA s, so I can’t wait to see what she brings this year. That’s the one I’m on the edge of my seat for. I’m also looking forward to Machine Gun Kelly and Travis Barker with Papercuts, when I looked at that video, it’s probably one of the most jarring videos of the year. I can’t imagine what the stage design is going to look like. You got The Kid LAROI performing with Justin Bieber, Stay. Justin leading the pack with 9 nominations. I’m just excited who takes home video of the year, artist of the year. Artists, I’m rooting for Megan Thee Stallion. I’m excited for it all. I can’t even pick one thing. MW:  It will be a party in Brooklyn for sure. Thank you so much for the time and all the best with the show! DP:  Thank you so much and I’m going to invite everyone to follow us at MTV News and we’ll be reporting from the red carpet. You’ll see some of my conversations with some of the night’s biggest stars, so I can’t wait to see you guys there!

It was an all-around tough night for Ray, who  got into an exchange  with Orioles manager Brandon Hyde in the second inning. Hyde yelled at Ray during an at-bat by Richie Martin. After Martin struck out, Ray motioned for Hyde to come out of the dugout, but the situation did not escalate any further. Ray, who was the American League Player of the Week, allowed three runs and a season-high eight hits and eight strikeouts over 4 1/3 innings.

According to court documents, Newell denied placing the camera, but later went to his bedroom and swallowed a memory card from a box with camera equipment. Investigators took him to the hospital for a CT scan, which showed the memory card in his body. Police said they searched Newell’s cabin, truck, boat and office and found multiple digital devices and a hard drive that showed videos of boys showering inside his home.

They want access to currently secret U.S. government documents that they believe will provide a link between the hijackers and the Saudi Arabian government, which they allege provided financial and other support to carry out the attacks. “They are very concerned there has not been a full airing of the facts,” Towson-based attorney Keith Franz told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Franz represents 14 families. Most of them are from Maryland, and many of their loved ones died in the attack on the Pentagon. They are suing the Saudi government for damages, claiming the Saudis helped finance and support the Al Qaeda terror plot. “They want to know how it was possible for these 19 hijackers—15 were Saudi nationals—how was it they were allowed to integrate into American life? How did they get their logistical support to carry out deeds on September 11th?” Franz said. In the weeks leading up to 9/11, some of the hijackers were secretly training in central Maryland for the terror attack. “Yes, in Laurel for an extended period of time. They improved logistics and reconnaissance during that period,” Franz said. The families got a break when the Biden Administration, fulfilling a campaign promise, ordered the review and possible release of classified FBI documents. “We’re going to be able to fill in the blanks with this previously state-secret, privileged information,” Franz said. He noted some of the documents could be released as early as the 9/11 20th anniversary this weekend. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The Saudi government said in a statement to CBS News that they “had nothing to do with this terrible crime” and they support the “full declassification of any documents.” The 9/11 Commission also found no direct link between the Saudi government and the attacks. But Franz and his clients are undeterred. “These families aren’t going to give up,” he said.  “Under U.S. law, those who support terrorists, financial or otherwise, are culpable for the crimes themselves.” Franz told WJZ his clients could receive settlements of $25 million to $35 million each through the U.S. Victim of State-Sponsored Terrorism Fund if a link can be proven. But he said this is not about money. “Accountability has always been the watchword. It is necessary the American public knows exactly what were the connections— how were the Saudis implicated. This is not just for the benefit of the 9/11 families. It’s for the benefit of all United States citizens, and it should help shape our foreign diplomacy as well.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government In response to the president’s decision to declassify some of the documents, the FBI said in a statement to CBS News that it will “continue to work in coordination with the Department of Justice and other agencies to declassify and release documents related to the 9/11 investigation.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.058958333333333335, "subjectivity": 0.4327083333333334, "wordcount": 517}

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,376 new COVID-19 cases and 20 deaths, according to state health department data released Saturday morning. The percentage of people testing positive increased by 0.08, currently sitting at 4.75%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.7 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 8, to 822. Of those hospitalized, 608 remain in acute care and 214 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 509,393 total confirmed cases and 9,935 deaths. There are 3,793,793 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,661,394 doses. Of those, 3,867,601 are first doses with 5,165 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,500,599 second doses, 5,690 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 293,194 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 318 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 82% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 14,006 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Sunday, Sept. 5. Of those cases, 1,060 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 7.4% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 6% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

In Parkville, Baltimore County firefighters, police and motorcyclists rode along Putty Hill Avenue to pay their respects and tolled the Maryland 9/11 rolling memorial bell to honor the 69 people from Maryland who were killed that day and the 158 people killed at war. “We wanted to honor those who made the sacrifice since 9/11 and remember those who were killed on 9/11,” said Chuck Ritz, the 9/11 Rolling Memorial organizer. In Reisterstown, Gov. Larry Hogan, Sen. Ben Cardin and members of the Maryland National Guard took a moment to remember the fallen heroes who fought in the War on Terror and the Iraq War. “I think remembering the people who died on 9/11, remembering all of our fallen heroes all of the families that have been impacted, reflect on all the service and sacrifice over the past 20 years, I think it’s critically important. That’s why we do these ceremonies every year,” Hogan said.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 13, to 809. Of those hospitalized, 595 remain in acute care and 214 are in the ICU.

The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 295,194 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 2,021 in the last day. The state reported 82.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Of those cases, 1,060 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 7.4% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state.

Two state agencies are now carrying out the details that will lead to issuing licenses to companies approved to offer the gambling, The Baltimore Sun reported. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Some sports gambling proponents had hoped to get the industry operating for the NFL and college football seasons. Now it could happen before those seasons end. “We’re looking at late fall, early winter. It is our intent to expedite the process as efficiently as we can to get us there,” said John Martin, director of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency. “We’re still very much pushing for football season.” Martin’s agency has proposed over 200 pages of governing regulations, which include the records that gambling operators must maintain and the types of bets that will be allowed. A public hearing on those rules is set for Sept. 22. Meanwhile, the Lottery and Gaming Control Agency is using emergency regulations to move forward on applications for licenses. Some in-person licenses are set aside for the state’s six casinos, the thoroughbred horse racing tracks in Laurel and Baltimore and the professional sports stadiums in the state that are home to the Baltimore Orioles, Baltimore Ravens and the Washington Football Team. Casinos are expected to apply first. An online application process expected to open soon will include investigations into the casinos’ financial and security plans. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The new Sports Wagering Application Review Commission, which has the final say on awarding licenses, will receive applications that pass the gaming agency’s background investigations. It’s likely to take well into 2022 before competitive brick-and-mortar and online sports betting licenses are issued, acccording to the newspaper. Sen. Craig Zucker, a Montgomery County Democrat who’s been heavily involved in advancing sports betting in Maryland, said he’s optimistic at least some gambling will be in place later in the fall, and certainly in time for the Super Bowl. “I feel like the sooner the better, but we’ve got to make sure we do it right and do it in a transparent and inclusive way,” Zucker said. Sports gambling companies will pay a 15% tax on their proceeds, going largely to public education. State government could bring in about $15 million annually once the industry is fully up and running, the newspaper reports. Some license application fees from the first applicants will be earmarked to help small businesses and minority- and women-owned businesses get into the industry.

It raises concerns for many parents with little ones. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The FDA said on Friday that they are “working around the clock” to support the process of making the COVID-19 vaccine available for children under the age of 12. “The vast majority of people that we see in the hospital are unvaccinated,” said Dr. Esti Schabelman, Chief Medical Officer at Sinai Hospital. Hospitals are staying busy and doctors say it’s not just COVID-19 patients. “Our biggest issue right now is just the tremendous volume of patients that we have due to people likely delaying care during the height of the covid pandemic,” said Dr. Schabelman. With the new school year underway, Dr. Schabelman said Marylanders should not let their guard down. “With kids especially who are currently unvaccinated, there’s another virus that they get called RSV that can also present the same problems if they have it with covid,” Dr. Shcabelman added. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We definitely carry hand sanitizer. I feel like the kids are really good and they’ve gotten used to keeping a little distance between them,” said Ryan Plunkett. Flu season is also approaching and with it comes more concerns. “The more general viruses that we have going around, the more people we’re going to have in the hospital,” Dr. Schabelman said. Here in Maryland, more than 1,100 new covid cases were reported Sunday but the statewide positivity rate remains below 5 percent. “I think people don’t want to go back down to any sort of lockdown,” said Emily McDermott. Efforts to get more shots in arms continue. President Biden’s latest sweeping rule requires a vaccine mandate for all businesses with more than 100 employees or face weekly testing. “I definitely think this is the right message. We’re not going to be able to end this pandemic until everyone is vaccinated,” Dr. Schabelman added.

Darren Waller, then just a mostly unknown practice squad player for the Ravens, was running with ease around the field with his 6-foot-6, 255-pound frame. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “We didn’t have anybody that looked like Darren Waller, not in terms of size, the speed, the athleticism,” Olson recalled this week. “I just hadn’t seen a player like that.” Olson went back to the locker room and told coach Jon Gruden about the intriguing player he saw. By the time the Raiders were flying home following a 34-17 loss that dropped them to 2-9 on the season, Gruden had already made what has been his best decision since returning as Raiders coach. Now Waller is a key part of the Raiders offense that will take on Baltimore in the season opener on Monday night. “When we got on the plane at the end of the game, we were on the runway actually and he said, ‘Sign that guy that you saw on the practice squad. We just signed him,'” Olson said. “He had to have the confidence in me, but obviously without him going forward with it, it wouldn’t have happened. So, real thankful and fortunate to have that relationship with him.” The Raiders are fortunate Olson saw what he did because Waller developed from a converted receiver whose career had been stalled by substance abuse problems into one of the most dynamic offensive players in the NFL. They officially added Waller to the roster two days after the loss in Baltimore and he showed flashes late that season. Waller then became a star in 2019 when he had 90 catches for 1,145 yards and three TDs to rank second to Travis Kelce among tight ends. He was even more productive last season with a Raiders-record 107 catches for 1,196 yards and nine TDs. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Now heading into his first game against the team that drafted him in the sixth round in 2015, Waller will be a top priority for the Ravens defense. “Every time I see him do something or read his name in the paper, I get mad, because he was here,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. “It’s like, ‘What happened?’ I think back on it, ‘Well, a lot of things happened.’ Now we have to play against him for the first time, and it’s a huge challenge.” Waller holds no ill will toward the Ravens, blaming himself for not reaching his potential in Baltimore. Waller was suspended four games in 2016 and all of 2017 because of drug violations. He spent the 2018 season on the Ravens’ practice squad before the Raiders signed him after he had 12 career catches in 18 games with Baltimore. “There’s not any kind of hard feelings or resentment or anything like that,” Waller said. “They didn’t even have to give me a chance to be on the practice squad. They could of just cut me before that. They had no reason to bring me back, but they still did. That gave me an opportunity. That allowed me to improve on my skills and take advantage of this opportunity when I came here. So I’m grateful for them.” Waller’s journey has been an inspiring one. He has worked tirelessly to help others with addiction, whether it’s a teammate such as defensive end Maxx Crosby or the kids he helps through his foundation. Olson said it’s that work off the field that has been the most gratifying to see. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “Has he exceeded expectations athletically? No, because he’s a phenomenal athlete,” Olson said. “But as far as a person and the character that he exhibits right now, he’s like one of the top people you could ever meet. He’s unbelievable, humble, transparent, a phenomenal worker and prepares like you wouldn’t believe. So, that part of it I guess we were blessed to have a guy like that and were fortunate.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.09763993316624897, "subjectivity": 0.48224728487886387, "wordcount": 719}

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “The researchers found that the primary reasons around the world for resisting vaccination include fears about side effects, a desire to wait until more people have had the shots so they know they are safe, and a lack of confidence in whether the vaccine really works,” according to the Bloomberg School. The most recent survey was conducted between Aug. 16-31. The dashboard gathers data from daily surveys that have polled more than 12 million people from 115 countries since May, a more robust sampling compared to a previous dashboard that had less frequent surveys between June 2020 and May 2021.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .02% to 4.75%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 7, to 802. Of those hospitalized, 597 remain in acute care and 205 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 511,646 total confirmed cases and 9,964 deaths. There are 3,806,256 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,683,600 doses. Of those, 3,877,344 are first doses with 3,609 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,510,543 second doses, 3,855 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 295,713 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 498 in the last day. The state reported 82.2% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 14,006 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Sunday, Sept. 5. Of those cases, 1,060 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 7.4% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 6% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Actor Jerry O’Connell and former NFL player and television host Akbar Gbajabiamila join Amanda Kloots and Sheryl Underwood. This week, guests like actor & comedian Lil Rel Howery, musician Chris Daughtry, actor Idina Menzel, actor & comedian Cedric the Entertainer and legendary musician Gloria Estefan will be joining the crew. CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith spoke with Kloots and Gbajabiamila about what fans can expect from the new season of “The Talk,” why their show stands out in the crowded daytime television space and what excites them the most about working with O’Connell and Underwood. “The Talk” airs weekdays from 2pm-3pm on CBS and streams live on Paramount+.

I think the other part of it is as a guest host last season, we didn’t have a live audience. To have a live audience now is going to feel good. I haven’t been in front of a big crowd like that in a while. It’s going to be good to have that and have that good feeling of being on the team. Today was special for me because I laid out my clothes like I was going back for the first day of school.” “I’m just so proud of our team and proud of our crew and I’m proud that we have a season 12,” said Kloots. “It’s going to be a great season. I love that we have Jerry & Akbar on the show now. I think it’s so fresh and new and a great way to kick off a new season. I love that they are both dads and I think that gives such a unique perspective to a show that has previously been women and mothers. I think that alone for our audience is cool and special. Nobody else is doing this. If you haven’t watched The Talk before, you’re in for a real treat.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Both Kloots and Gbajabiamila have had interesting journeys en route to “The Talk.” Gbajabiamila, who is a husband and father of four, played in the NFL, hosted “American Ninja Warrior” and wrote a book. Meanwhile, Kloots is a mother, a former Broadway performer and an author as well. Kloots tragically lost her husband Nick Cordero to COVID-19 in 2020 and she is so thankful she’s had the opportunity to use “The Talk” to grieve and work out her feelings. “This show has been a saving grace,” said Kloots. “I can’t say it enough. Just to have a home to go to everyday and to have a family to be a part of everyday and to be told to be somewhere everyday, when you are grieving you feel very lost and you feel very alone and it is such a rollercoaster ride. Just to have the normalcy of a work schedule and a crew and a cast of people that truly do have your back, it has meant the world to me.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “I keep it 100 and keep it real,” said Gbajabiamila. “I think transparency is key on daytime and just in anything in general in keeping it real and being authentic. For me, relationships are always big. That’s something I pride myself on in constantly trying to understand. I have been married for 12 years, I have four kids, a college kid at the University of Oregon, a 12-year-old and twins who are nine.

SU:  Carla Hall with the cooking show is going to be amazing. I don’t want anyone to miss a minute because we got surprises from top to bottom. And we got a surprise for you Jerry O’Connell. It will involve water and possibly a softball hitting something metal. Where you’ll be falling…in the water. JO:  I’m not going in a dunk tank. There was talk about me going into a dunk tank. SU:  Oh yes, you are. JO:  I can’t go in a dunk tank. SU:  Yes, you can. JO:  No, I can’t. SU:  Yes. JO:  Do you know how much make up I wear? None of it is waterproof. SU:  Sorry. JO:  My hair; it’s a whole thing. No, I can’t do it. I will not go… Ok I’ll go in the dunk tank. SU:  Me, Amanda, and Akbar are going to make sure that you fall in some water and it’s going to be a great experience. We’re so excited to have a live audience back, that energy is amazing. The entire week a lot of fun. Cedrick the Entertainer from  The Neighborhood  is going to be with us, he’s hosting the  Prime Time Emmys . I hosted the  Daytime Emmys . It’s going to be a little Emmy reunion thing. We got Lil Rel with the comedy game. We’ve got Angela Basset coming and our favorite Gloria Estefan is coming.

It’s our time to salute them. But it’s great to have them personally in the audience so that they can send us love and we can send that love right back to them. JO:  We’re just really grateful. The fun thing about being on  The Talk  is that we’re given a platform to not only thank them but thank them in a very public manner. And we get CBS to give them a lot of cash and prizes. It’s a win win for everybody. MW:  This new group you have, with you two and Amanda Kloots and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila. How’s the chemistry with all of you? SU:  It’s been amazing because we all have so much in common with each other. We have a family atmosphere, but I also love that Akbar and Jerry teach me about fantasy football and it’s really fun. You know what it’s like? It’s like having some brothers come hang out with you. I mean I know the  brothers,  but I mean like your brothers, so you can have fun. It’s between the breaks that we laugh the hardest. Jerry and I, sometimes they have to separate us because we’re having so much fun. Amanda is just delightful. Her spirit is just so amazing, and we support her in everything she’s doing. To bring Akbar in, it’s just a match made in heaven. It’s going to be so much fun. But Jerry O’Connell is a rascal. He’s a rascal. He’ll make you laugh so hard; you forget am I supposed be reading this? You’re trying to hold yourself together. MW:  Jerry would you like to defend yourself against these claims of rascalness? [laughs] JO:  No. It’s absolutely true. [Laughs] I am a little bit new to this. It was so funny, when I was still just guest hosting, when I was in here a couple times, Sheryl, you remember I wasn’t looking at the right camera or I wasn’t technically doing something right and these shows are live. I was publicly apologizing a lot for my lack of experience. I’m really looking forward to talking about the daily topics, what everybody else is talking about with this crew. We’re going to have a great season. SU:  You know what was fun about that? We all have looked at the wrong camera or done something crazy. It’s almost like a join the family thing. We all laugh because we’ve all done it. What I love about Jerry, Jerry is so quick on his feet. Remember that interview we were doing and you were looking beyond and someone was making a bed or doing something and you just picked it up. Jerry, what about when John Corbett announced that he and Bo Derek were married? JO:  Yeah. Yeah. That was special. It really is fun because a lot of these interviews are done over zoom. I have feeling that a lot of our guests will be coming in, we will have an audience, it’s going to be a fun season. MW:  Well unfortunately, that’s all the time I have for you both but thank you so much, awesome to talk you as always and all the best with the show! JO:  Thanks Matt!

City officials will provide more details about these initiatives during a series of announcements in September and October, Scott said. “$641 million is a significant investment,” Scott said.

And in this crisis we get to choose whether we will be guided by the data, driven by equity and propelled to put aside conventional solutions.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government In his Facebook video, Scott committed to having the Mayor’s Office of Recovery Programs participate in quarterly meetings before the council to discuss how the funds are used.

On this season’s premiere Dr. Phil talks to a woman whose husband died while they were on vacation in Mexico and her battle to discover the truth of what happened. CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to Dr. Phil about this latest episode as well as look back on 20 seasons. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW:  Dr. Phil, good to see you again. Especially since we’re just ahead of your landmark 20th season premiere. What does the 20th season mean to you?   Dr. P:  Good to see you too, Matt. It’s kind of hard to wrap your head around. I think back to when this whole thing started, in this very studio, in some ways it feels like this is all I’ve ever done. In some ways it seems like it was just yesterday.  Twenty seasons, we’ve done something like 17,000 guests 3,500 shows. A lot has changed since that first show until today. Society has evolved, technology has evolved, a lot of new challenges, but very excited to start this 20th season.   MW:  And for that 20th season, you have an exclusive interview with Jamie Snow. Tragically her husband was found dead during their 10-year wedding anniversary vacation. How is she doing?   Dr. P:  This really hits close to home for me. This man, Elijah, is a fire fighter from Arlington, TX, which is a suburb of Dallas. They had gone to Cancun to celebrate their 10th anniversary. This wasn’t their first time down there. They knew the area well. They’ve been down there many times. They went down, the first night on this trip, at four in morning, she wakes up to find him gone. He’s not in bed with her. She’s alarmed, she thinks, wow, this isn’t right.  She gets up and starts looking around, even calls security. They can’t find him. It’s a huge property. One of these high-rise, all inclusive, luxury resorts. They can’t find him. Hours later. They notify her, they have found his body. He’s dead at a resort next door. He’s in an area where guests don’t go. This is way back in the mechanical area. Way back in the area that supports the resort, and his body is hanging out of a basement window. They say, oh, it’s just an accident. He got stuck in the window and it compressed his chest, and he couldn’t breathe. She doesn’t believe that. This is a fire fighter. He’s in great shape. He can tell if he can get in or out of a window or not. Why would he be going in or out of this window? It makes no sense. The police just don’t cooperate with her. She has to bribe them to even get a look at computer screen. They won’t let her see the body. She only can see a computer screen with a picture. They won’t let her see that until she bribes them. She can’t get a still photo until she bribes them more. When she finally gets to be with the body at a private funeral home. Matt, she actually has to manipulate the body herself. She has to lift it up with one hand and take pictures with her cell phone. She’s documenting bruising all over the body. She believes he was beaten to death. In order to document that, she’s down there by herself, no help, no family, no cooperation. She thinks the whole thing was covered up. There are video cameras all over the place. They say, nope, no footage. Nobody will cooperate. She has to go home and tell her two young children, I know we went down there together, but I’m home without your father because he’s dead. He’s not coming home. She of course is just devastated.   MW:  Why does she think they’re being so uncooperative her?   Dr. P:  She thinks the cartel is in control of the police in this area of Mexico. She thinks they’re wanting to sweep this under the rug, it just goes away, so they’re stonewalling her. They don’t want an investigation. They don’t want attention to it. They’re just trying to hopefully stonewall her; she’ll go home, and nobody will make any to do about it. That’s why she wanted to do the interview. One of two reasons. One was to draw attention to this, so he isn’t just forgotten. The other was to get help. She’s just completely coming unraveled here. She’s got these two children to raise. She can’t get past this because she feels so violated. Not only has she lost her husband, but they’re just throwing this away like it’s nothing. He wasn’t nothing and she wants to fight back.   MW:  For her and anyone going through grief for that matter, what advice do you give people to manage going through such a difficult time? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn   Dr. P:  Grief is a very individual thing. You have to meet yourself where you are on a given day. There’s not a schedule. It’s not like you should be through this in three months or six months. It’s not something you get over. It’s just something you get through. I think people just need to realize that healing and finding a way to live your life and find some peace and joy is not a betrayal of the person you lost. You have to ask yourself, what would they want you to do. And with these two children to raise she has to find a way to heal her heart and be there for her children. I think sometimes people feel very guilty when they move to the next level. It’s not a reflection of how much you love or didn’t love your lost one. When you find a way to accommodate it doesn’t mean you’ve gotten over the person. You just find a way to adapt to it and make it part of your reality. She’ll never forget him. I encourage her to make him part of their narrative. Don’t hide this, don’t let the children forget him, talk about him at holidays. Keep his picture up, don’t ever let them forget him. Understand that it will take time.   MW:  You’ve helped so many people throughout the years and taught so many people so many lesson. Last question before I let you go, what would you say is the biggest lesson that you’ve learned yourself?   Dr. P:  Working with the people that I have, I really learned that people truly, truly want to live their best life and do the best thing, but sometimes we get into these situations and it’s hard to take an objective view of your own life. When you can step back and see it, maybe somebody else is living that same situation or you see your life up on that big screen, it can be a big wake up call. It’s real hard to look at your own face for example; you’re not that fast. If you can step out of your own life and look back at it, you go, oh wow, I can do something about this. I think giving people some objectivity, giving them an opportunity to look at their own lives and recognize, I can do better. I can change this. I have more to offer to myself, my family, my friends, my community. I think that has been a really great lesson for me. I’m an incurable optimist about the human spirit. I think that’s been so inspiring to me to see how people fight back and make real changes in their lives.   MW:  Especially after the last few years, I think we can all use some incurable optimism.   Dr. P:  Ain’t that the truth.   MW:  Thank you so much for the time Dr. Phil, always a pleasure!   Dr. P:  Thanks, Matt.

How does it to feel have  Back To Life  back in action for your fans?   DH:  It feels great. It feels really lucky to have the opportunity to revisit the characters to take them to the next spot of their wild journey.    MW:  When you got the news that there was going to be a second season, what was your reaction, how excited were you?   DH:  Laura [Solon] and I were really, really happy. We’ve been sort of chatting about where we wanted to take Miri in the next part of the story. We felt quite ready. We felt ready to write it. We got into the flow with season one and now we want to have some fun!   MW:  And all six episodes will be available on September 13th, the fans can stream all of it. What does that feel like as a creator that you can put everything out there all at once and be like here you are, enjoy it…   DH:  It’s quite nice, really. In the UK I noticed that loads of people are trying to do two a night, but actually most people are eating it all at once. It’s quite nice to think they are all staying up too late and really tired for work because you’ve been funny. It’s fun. It’s nice.   MW:  Has anyone asked you for a permission slip for their boss, sorry I’m tired today…   DH:  Somebody did.   MW:  Oh really, wow. [Laughs] that’s amazing.

You’re the creator, the co-writer, and the star of the series. What’s it like wearing all those hats?   DH:  It’s great. It’s a huge privilege to be able to wear those hats. I’ve always wanted to wear those hats. I really enjoy all the elements. When you’ve got lovely producers and director and people around you, which we’re so lucky to have, people supporting you, they make your job so much easier. I could so fluidly swap hats without it feeling too stressful.   MW:  The show has gotten such great feedback from critics and the fans, how good does it feel that this thing that you created, that’s like your baby, has been so positively received?   DH:  It feels amazing. I don’t think I’ll ever not be terrified if I write a show. It’s terrifying the day before it comes out, you think, why on earth have I done this. I’m never doing it again. What a terrible day and then you get some nice feedback and then you’re like oh, it’s a huge relief. It’s just fun to watch people enjoy it.   MW:  That’s really interesting, you really are like exposing a part of yourself by putting this out there…   DH:  Yeah, and this show is strange. It’s really dark. It’s really silly.  It’s definitely bold, so you do have a moment before it comes out where you’re like [deep breath] [laughs]. Yeah, relief is the thing.   MW:  For all the fans that are excited to watch the new season, what words do you have for them? What do they have to look forward to?   DH:  This season, the parents of the girl Miri murdered, or Miri killed should I say, are back in town.

Alicia Adams’s mom juggled school with doctor’s appointments. “This is an ongoing problem so long, it’s not even healthy to have their rooms hot with COVID spreading like it is,” said Rachel Strozykowski, a parent. “It’s a distraction, they can’t do work,” said Joel Greenidge, another parent. “They can’t do much of anything.” The school district has been gradually upgrading buildings since the state approved a plan in 2017. “This is the first time in all her schooling that we’ve been in a school with no air conditioning,” said Strozykowski. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Year after year, it’s the same nonsense. I keep hearing the same thing over and over,” said Greenidge. The mayor says it’s not as easy as air conditioner units. “For example, City College is not a place where you can just go and plug in air conditioning units when you’re talking about a castle built hundreds of years ago,” said Mayor Scott. “Why haven’t they taken care of that,” asked Greenidge. “To me, that’s some of the most basic of needs.” “This is an aggressive pace when you think about how capital projects are done,” added Mayor Scott. City schools say they’re on track to meet the goal the state set: to get all schools up to speed on air conditioning by next school year. In a statement, a spokesman said, in part, the district, “reduced the number of schools without air conditioning from 75 schools in 2017 to 21 schools as of last month.” That is 54 additional schools with air conditioning since the plan was approved four years ago, along with necessary upgrades to electrical systems and windows.

The group reported 243,373 new cases among kids over the past week. While this is a decline from last week, when 251,781 cases were reported, it’s about a 240% increase since early July, when kids accounted for 71,726 cases.   “After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially with nearly 500,000 cases in the past two weeks,” AAP said in a statement.     The latest update comes as schools across the country are in full swing and experts have advised adults to get vaccinated to protect children under 12 who are not eligible for the vaccine.       As of Thursday, nearly 5.3 million children total have tested positive for Covid-19, AAP said, and children currently account for 29% of all cases reported nationwide.         Officials debate when child vaccines will be ready     As of Monday, 63% of the eligible population in the US — those 12 and older — are fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts and officials are aiming for the vast majority of the population to be inoculated.     President Joe Biden announced new vaccine requirements last week that were met with praise and criticism. The new requirements include a mandate for businesses with more than 100 employees to require vaccination or regular testing for employees.     Parents could have access to vaccines for children by Halloween, according to Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a board member at Pfizer and the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.   He told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that Pfizer is expected to have data on vaccinations for children ages 5-11 ready for the FDA by the end of September.     “The FDA says it will be a matter of weeks, not months, to make a determination if they’re going to authorize vaccines for kids between 5 to 11. I interpret that to be perhaps four weeks, maybe six weeks,” said Gottlieb.     CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday, however, that the public health agency is working urgently on a Covid-19 vaccine for younger children she hopes could be ready by the end of the year.     In the meantime, the FDA cautioned parents not to race to vaccinate their children before approval from the agency.   “Children are not small adults — and issues that may be addressed in pediatric vaccine trials can include whether there is a need for different doses or different strength formulations of vaccines already used for adults,” the FDA said in a statement Friday.     Children are less likely to die from Covid-19     Children are far less likely than adults to suffer serious disease or to die from Covid-19. Among states that report hospitalizations by age, children make up 1.6% to 4% of patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19.             Among the states that report death by age, children accounted for no more than 0.27% of the deaths. Seven states have reported zero child deaths. As of Sunday, the CDC reported 523 deaths among people younger than 18 in the United States.   Pre-teens and teens have the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates of any age group.

Spokeswoman, Lt.

Davis said, “we don’t know if the shot was purposeful, we don’t know if it was accidental, we also don’t know if it’s some sort of fluke with the car where the back windshield just cracked.” A woman who lives near the Elementary school, placed into a ‘lockout,’ said, “I started seeing individuals get out of vehicles in tactical gear I knew it wouldn’t be a normal Tuesday morning.” She said her daughter will start Kindergarten at the Cape St. Claire Elementary School and this has made her nervous knowing other kids were in the school; “I can’t imagine, I’m just very empathetic for those parents right now.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn This mom also said, “maybe I’m crazy to say this, but I feel for the kid to make such a stupid decision.. if that’s what it turns out to be,” she added, “we don’t know what’s going on and mental health is a real issue. I’m not saying that’s what it is, but kids are under a lot of stress, kids you’re under a lot of pressure.” Anne Arundel County Schools lifted their shelter in place order and resumed operations as normal by the end of the school day.

Michael Greenberger founded the University of Maryland Carey School of Law’s Center for Health and Homeland Security.  “Domestic terrorism is a very serious threat. We will not always get advanced notice,” he said. Greenberger is hopeful things will not get out of hand because there is enough advanced notice, and law enforcement is taking this more seriously than in January. “As a general matter, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have to be on alert. I do not see this Saturday as being of consequence because the lesson was learned on January 6th,” Professor Greenberger told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren. More than a dozen people from Maryland have been charged in the January 6th attack, and many of those cases are still winding their way through the courts. They include that of Daniel Egtvedt from Western Maryland who allegedly confronted officers inside the Capitol that day. They later threw him out of the building.   Another Marylander charged in connection with the January 6th riot at the US Capitol.

Carr’s second TD pass of the game came after Carl Nassib’s strip sack of Lamar Jackson at the Ravens 27. Nassib made big news this offseason when he became the first active NFL player to come out as gay. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The Raiders had thrown an interception after driving to the 1 on the opening possession of overtime and made another blunder with a delay of game before a field goal try. Coach Jon Gruden then sent the offense back on the field and Carr hit Jones on the next play for the game-winner. The Raiders trailed 14-0 early, ending a 98-game, regular-season win streak for the Ravens when leading by at least 14 points dating to 2004. The loss capped a rough stretch for the Ravens, who have had a run of injuries that sidelined top three running backs J.K. Dobbins, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill, as well as cornerback Marcus Peters, for the season. They had won the past five openers by a margin of 177-26, but came up short in this nail-biter thanks to a strong game from Carr, who threw for 435 yards . The overtime came after a wild back-and-forth fourth quarter that featured the Raiders rallying to tie the game on three separate occasions, with Carr driving Las Vegas to a tying 55-yard field goal in the final 37 seconds. The Ravens had taken the lead when Jackson scrambled 28 yards to help set up Justin Tucker’s 47-yard field goal. The Raiders earlier got a forced fumble by Quinton Jefferson against Jackson to set up Josh Jacobs’ 15-yard TD run, tying the game at 17. The Ravens answered when former Raider Latavius Murray ran it in from 8 yards one play after Jackson found  Sammy Watkins on a mismatch  for a 49-yard pass. Carr then connected on a 37-yard pass to Henry Ruggs III that set up a tying 10-yard TD to Darren Waller with 3:44 to play. SPECTACULAR PLAY Jackson’s TD pass to Marquise Brown in the first half was a spectacular individual effort. He escaped pressure from Maxx Crosby and Yannick Ngakoue and scrambled before finding Brown in the back of the end zone for a 10-yard score.

GO FOR IT The Ravens went for it twice on fourth down in the first half, getting a  35-yard TD run from Ty’Son Williams  on one of the first.  Murray got stuffed by K.J. Wright  on the second. The Raiders got stopped on a fourth-and-1 run by Jacobs at the Ravens 13 in the third quarter. SLOW START The Raiders got off to a sluggish start offensively after sitting most of their starters in the preseason. A holding penalty and botched snap spoiled a promising first drive that reached the Ravens 21 before going backwards and ending in a punt. The Raiders then punted on the next three drives, marking the first time in 15 years they punted on the first four drives of the season. They found a groove late in the half with a 75-yard drive capped by  Jacobs’ 2-yard run  and then getting a 34-yard field goal from Daniel Carlson to make it 14-10 at the break. INJURY REPORT Ravens: G Tyre Phillips was taken off the field on a cart late in the first half after injuring his leg and didn’t return. Raiders: G Denzelle Good left in the first half with a knee injury. … Ngakoue left in the second half with a hamstring injury. … DT Gerald McCoy was taken off on a cart in the fourth quarter with a knee injury.

As of Monday, the National League West and the American League East would each send three teams. The San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers would be two of them out west, followed by the San Diego Padres, if they can hold onto their slim lead. Four teams have a legitimate shot at the playoffs out of the AL East. The Tampa Bay Rays hold a nine-game lead in the division race. But the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, and New York Yankees all sit within a game of each other. How it will play out is anyone’s guess. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts This week’s Baseball Report looks at three stories playing out against the backdrop of the playoff races. The first is Max Scherzer’s continued dominance, as the new Dodger threw his 3,000th strikeout. The second is Francisco Lindor’s three-home run game to lift the New York Mets over the New York Yankees. The third is the Toronto Blue Jays’ outpouring of runs at the expense of the hapless Baltimore Orioles. Scherzer Throws 3,000th Strikeout Scherzer has reached yet another milestone in his Hall of Fame career. The 37-year-old right-handed pitcher threw his  3,000th strikeout  in the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 8-0 win Sunday over the San Diego Padres. He reached the milestone in the fifth inning, setting down Eric Hosmer on a 3-2 pitch. Scherzer became the 19th pitcher in MLB history to toss at least 3,000 strikeouts in his career. The three-time Cy Young Award winner had a no-hitter going into the eighth inning, until Hosmer broke it up with a one-out double. That would be the only hit he allowed. Scherzer threw 92 pitches, recording no walks and nine strikeouts on the afternoon. Three of those came in the second inning, when he struck out the side on nine pitches for an  immaculate inning . Scherzer is 6-0 with the Dodgers after coming over from the Washington Nationals at the trade deadline. He had a 1.05 ERA with the team going into the game, and has a 2.26 ERA in his 26 starts this season across the two teams. Scherzer made his major-league debut with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2008. The 11th-overall pick two years prior was traded to the Detroit Tigers after two seasons and 240 strikeouts. He played five seasons with the Tigers, piling up 1,081 strikeouts and earning his first Cy Young Award for his efforts. Scherzer was traded to the Nationals in 2015, where he struck out 1,610 more batters, won a World Series and two more Cy Young Awards. In Washington, he led the majors in strikeouts for three consecutive years. Scherzer has exceeded 200 strikeouts every season since 2012, except for the shortened 2020 season. Scherzer is the first pitcher to reach 3,000 strikeouts since 2019, when Justin Verlander accomplished the feat. It’s impossible to predict when the next pitcher will join the 3,000 club. Starting pitchers are throwing fewer innings, but pitchers, in general, are recording more strikeouts. Houston Astros’ Zack Greinke is the closest active pitcher. He currently has 2,799 strikeouts. Lindor Blasts Three Home Runs The Mets and Yankees are still in the playoff hunt. The Mets hurt their chances with a miserable August that saw them drop from first to third in the NL East. They now sit five games out of the division lead and three games out of a Wild Card spot. The Yankees have gone cold of late too, losing eight of their last 10. That includes a four-game sweep at the hands of the Toronto Blue Jays. They now sit 10 games back in fourth in the AL East but only one game out in the Wild Card race. READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University This weekend’s  subway series  at Citi Field was an opportunity for one of these teams to possibly gain a little ground. With only a few weeks left, chances are becoming fewer and fewer. The teams split the first two matchups. The Mets downed the Yankees 10-3 Friday, and the Yankees returned the favor 8-7 on Saturday. Things got a little chippy on Sunday night in the  series rubber match . The Mets already harbored some bad feelings based on suspicions that the Yankees had been whistling from the dugout to signal pitches in the previous game. After his second home run in the sixth inning , Lindor, who also hit a three-run shot in the second, referenced that suspicion to Yankees players as he rounded the bases. The Yankees didn’t like that. Giancarlo Stanton let his feelings be known while running the bases after his solo shot the next inning. He actually slowed to a walk between second and third base to jaw with Lindor. The benches cleared, and the bullpens emptied. But it didn’t amount to anymore than talk. The fireworks weren’t over. In the eighth inning, with the score tied at six runs apiece, Lindor hit his third home run of the game. That ended up being the margin of victory.   THREE HOMERS FOR FRANCISCO. 😱  pic.twitter.com/D4iO3ClKOV   — MLB (@MLB)  September 13, 2021 Stanton had a chance to even up the game or take the lead in the ninth inning. He stepped to the plate with two men on and two outs, but then popped up to end the game. Blue Jays Score 44 Runs On Orioles The red-hot Blue Jays now occupy one of the two American League Wild Card spots. (The Boston Red Sox have the other.) And after scoring  44 runs  on the hapless Baltimore Orioles in just three games, they show no signs of letting up. The Orioles won the opener of the four-game series on Friday. But the Blue Jays struck back hard the following day. Toronto won both games of Saturday’s doubleheader, 11-10 and 11-2. They would follow that up with 22 more runs in Sunday’s game. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and Teoscar Hernández each pounded a grand slam. It was the first time the team has ever hit a  pair of grand slams  in a game. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. added his 44th home run of the season to climb into a tie with Shohei Ohtani for the league lead. The Blue Jays would end the game with 19 hits overall.

The Northwest’s record-breaking heat wave in June, which scientists say would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change, for instance, killed hundreds of people in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. When Hurricane Ida pummeled Louisiana early this month, a heat wave exacerbated the impacts of the storm. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The compounding consequences of extreme heat don’t fall equally across communities. A  recent study  from the University of California, San Diego, found that low-income neighborhoods and communities with high Black, Hispanic and Asian populations experience significantly more heat than wealthier and predominantly white neighborhoods. It reflects an  earlier study  that traces the legacy of neighborhood redlining, the government-sanctioned effort in the 1930s to segregate people of color by denying them housing loans and insurance. While redlining was banned in the late 1960s, remnants of the discriminatory practice are still apparent. The research analyzed 108 cities in the United States and found that 94% of historically redlined neighborhoods are disproportionately hotter than other areas in the same city. Redlined neighborhoods typically suffer the most from the urban heat island effect, according to the study, in which some urban areas can be up to 20 degrees hotter than neighborhoods just a few blocks away. Areas with a lot of asphalt, buildings and freeways absorb more of the sun’s heat than areas with parks, rivers and tree-lined streets. Vivek Shandas, lead author of the redlining study and professor of climate adaptation and urban policy at Portland State University, said in addition to historic planning policies, the materials used to construct buildings also play a huge role in amplifying the most severe effects of extreme heat, particularly in low-income apartment complexes. “What we end up seeing, as these higher density buildings are made of materials that are often able to withstand a heavier load from the multiple floors, is that they’re made out of concrete and steel, which amplifies heat,” Shandas previously told CNN. “So not only do we have historic planning policies that are creating a distribution of heat that’s inequitable, we’re also seeing the kinds of buildings that are going into historically disinvested neighborhoods are those types of buildings that retain the sun’s solar radiation, and then amplify it.” The effect is striking on the walk from Manhattan’s Central Park to East Harlem, says Sonal Jessel, director of policy at the Harlem-based nonprofit WE ACT for Environmental Justice. The trees that dot the wealthy and predominantly white Upper East Side neighborhood begin to disappear, Jessel says. In contrast, East Harlem, a diverse and historically marginalized neighborhood, is surrounded by freeways and streets, has less tree cover and more industry. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Ultimately, I describe extreme heat as such a risk-multiplier,” Jessel told CNN. “It’s not an issue that exists in a vacuum at all, and lower-income communities or communities of color bear the brunt of all these different hardships.” Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, two major cities that got scorched by the June heat wave, rank first and third, respectively, among cities with the highest proportion of households without air conditioning, according to a  US Census Bureau survey  of 25 major metropolitan areas. Experts say those least likely to have air conditioning are the people who will endure the worst heat — historically underserved communities. “And unfortunately, we’re not well prepared, just generally speaking in the Pacific Northwest, for heat,” Shandas said. “That’s where the human side of it comes up, whether people are recognizing that they’re actually experiencing some level of heat stress and it might be an unfamiliar experience for them.” June Spector, a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, said heat exhaustion is one of the most common heat-related illnesses, yet many remain unaware of its symptoms. “You haven’t quite gotten to that point where the core body temperature has gone up, but you feel nauseous, have a headache, you feel very fatigued, and you’re probably somewhat dehydrated if you’ve been in a really hot environment,” Spector told CNN. “Having that awareness is really key because you don’t want to not treat that or not address that before it gets more serious.” Some cities are already taking steps to tackle the ripple effects of extreme heat. In  Chicago  and  Philadelphia , city governments are offering financial incentives to install green roofs to cool cities and combat urban heat. In Dallas, urban green spaces are set to be built in some of the most heat-sensitive areas of the city. In Los Angeles, some streets are being painted with a grayish-white coating to prevent absorbing energy from the sun, and instead reflecting it back. In New York, Jessel has been overseeing a flurry of sustainable and equitable heat action plans, implementing an initiative that focuses on heat, health and equity. A big part of that initiative is ensuring low-income renters are well equipped to deal with extreme heat while simultaneously mitigating climate change through energy-efficient buildings. Experts say climate change-fueled disasters are becoming a public health issue. Some, like extreme heat, are turning into mass casualty events. Experts such as Jessel and Spector say such plans need to be equitable to avoid the most pernicious public health impacts. “It’s really up to us to figure out how can we mitigate that and kind of halt climate change if possible,” Spector said, “but really adapt to it and figure out how we can make our communities safer for everyone.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The little girl set up her desk with pencils and supplies including a fresh bottle of hand sanitizer, which was on the list of school supplies for the kindergarten class. By lunch, the 5-year-old girl had collapsed. “The principal called and said to get to the school immediately,” the girl’s mom said. “She was walking a little wobbly down the hall. By the time they got to the classroom, to the lunchroom, she fell and couldn’t sit up straight.” The mom to three young children does not want to be identified, but did want to share the story of her youngest. She said the little girl was rushed to Children’s Hospital from the school. “She was completely out of it. I tried to wake her and she opened her eyes briefly and she looked at me, but it was almost as if she looked straight through me. And she started to cry and then she laid back down,” the mother said. “I was very scared. I had no idea. The medic didn’t have any idea either.” Hours later, at the hospital, the little girl came to, but mom still had no answers as to what happened, until the school called again. “This class, each student has their own sanitizer pump bottle at their desk with their name on it for their personal use,” the mother said. “My daughter had consumed half of that bottle. She consumed 6 ounces of 70% alcohol.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Her blood-alcohol level was .23. In a statement, the school Superintendent Barry Balaski said, “The health and wellness of our students is a priority. The district provides hand-sanitizing stations that are available in each of our schools. In addition, students are permitted to have hand sanitizer in their desk or backpack. However, students are not required to keep it in their desk or backpack, particularly if a parent/guardian does not want them to have it.” Dr. Michael Lynch, head of the Pittsburgh Poison Center, says there’s been an increase of kids ingesting hand sanitizer. “In Pennsylvania, in the last 18 months, more or less since the start of the pandemic, we’ve seen a 56% increase in hand sanitizer exposure cases compared to the 18 months prior to that,” he said. Dr. Lynch says that amounts to about 2,300 cases, most under the age of 5, and about 6% of those kids needed to go to the hospital. “Hand sanitizers will typically have 70% or so ethanol, which means they’re about 140 proof,” Dr. Lynch said. “Even a small amount can be enough to get intoxicated.” The little girl is okay now, but her mom still worries about what happened and wants to make sure other parents and caregivers are aware of the dangers.

With children now accounting for more than a quarter of weekly COVID-19 cases nationwide, many communities are turning to a familiar public health tool: quarantines. Health experts agree that quarantines work, but also stress the importance of in-person learning for children’s development. Now many communities are struggling to toe the line between keeping schools open and keeping those who are potentially infectious at home. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Additional layers of protection, like vaccination, testing and masking, can limit the need for quarantines, but those who are against one often push back on all. Union County Public Schools in North Carolina announced Monday that it will no longer enforce contact tracing and quarantining policies for students and staff who are asymptomatic or test negative after exposure to COVID-19. Masks are optional in the school district. Angie McCray, a parent in the district, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Tuesday the decision is “upsetting and disappointing,” and she’s debating whether to send her first grader back to class in-person. McCray is a pharmacist who stepped back from work to teach her child at home last year; she’s not eager to do it again, but says she has to think about safety first. “I’m currently pregnant and I’m concerned for my family’s safety,” McCray said. “We were so excited to go back to public school and be able to let her have somewhat of a normal education, and the school board has just made decisions that are not logical and are affecting my family, and so many families in the county.” The spread of COVID-19 has created disruptions and challenges for schools already this year. At least 44,556 students and staff have quarantined in Florida’s major school districts since the start of the new school year. One middle school in Fulton County, Georgia, transitioned from in-person to remote learning last week, just one month since classes began, after an increase in COVID-19 cases. Some schools around the nation are offering remote instruction to students in quarantine or isolation, but some parents and politicians, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are resisting. “I think quarantining healthy kids deprives these kids of an ability to get an education,” DeSantis said in August. “Now maybe a parent would want a healthy kid to be quarantined, if there’s an exposure, but I think that should be the choice of the parent.” The experts disagree. Allowing people to choose whether to quarantine defeats the purpose of having one. Doctor: Actions that ‘imperil’ others shouldn’t be a parent’s choice “If you are trying to stop a disease that is rampaging through a community, killing people who don’t have to die, you really have to use quarantine,” Dr. Christoph Diasio, a North Carolina pediatrician, told CNN. “Deciding what color shoes your child wears to school, that’s maybe a reasonable parental choice,” he added. “But when your action can imperil other people, it doesn’t feel to me like that should be in the realm of a parent’s choice.” Choosing not to quarantine a child who has been exposed to the virus can indeed imperil other people, experts say. “It’s not just about our child’s health. It’s about the health of the other kids in the school,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN’s Brianna Keilar last month, in response to DeSantis’ comments. Murthy said he worries about states that are trying to block evidence-based prevention measures. “The science tells us that tried-and-true methods, like contact tracing; like isolation and quarantine, when required; like improved ventilation; regular testing — these are all the layers of precaution that we can take to reduce the risk to our children,” Murthy said. Known exposure requires quarantine in schools “Kids who are sick shouldn’t be in school, and kids who’ve had a known exposure do need to quarantine until we know for sure that they’re not infected — and more importantly that they’re not infectious,” Shira Shafir, associate professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, told CNN. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that remote learning earlier in the pandemic highlighted inequalities, exacerbated mental health issues and was detrimental to the education of all students. The group has advocated for a safe return to in-person learning this school year, guided by safety measures — including quarantining. Research has shown that quarantine measures can help reduce the spread of the virus in school and community settings. A  research review , which included 32 studies focused on COVID-19, found that with quarantine, the number of people infected with coronaviruses could be reduced by between 44% and 96%. “Quarantine is a key function of public health, especially in this disease, where people are actually infectious before they know they’re sick,” Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska College of Public Health, told CNN. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s school guidance recommends unvaccinated people and vaccinated people with symptoms quarantine for 14 days if they’ve been in close contact with an infected person. This means close contacts who are vaccinated and showing no symptoms can continue to attend school — as long as they are masked for 14 days or until they receive a negative test result — but currently, no students under the age of 12 are vaccinated. The agency says close contacts who are not vaccinated should get tested. Depending on guidelines from local health authorities, the CDC says the quarantine period may be shortened to 10 days without testing or seven days with a negative test. The CDC defines close contact as being within six feet of someone for a cumulative total of 15 minutes a day — though the agency notes an exception for students in K-12 classrooms, if the students involved are wearing masks. Transmitting without symptoms Even a seemingly healthy child who is exposed to the virus can place others at risk and increase the chance of a school shutting down, experts say. “One of the things, unfortunately, we know about COVID-19 is that people can transmit the virus for a couple days before they begin to manifest any symptoms,” said Shafir. “It becomes really important to comply with quarantine, because by the time a child has symptoms of infection, it is entirely possible that they have been infecting and exposing others already.” Shafir said quarantine measures can be used in combination with testing and isolation for those who are infected. The CDC has cited research from North Carolina and Chicago showing safety measures, including quarantining and masking, helped schools maintain lower COVID-19 transmission rates than those of the surrounding communities. Increased risk as Delta spreads The Delta variant is more than twice as contagious as previous COVID-19 variants, and some data suggests that it can cause more severe illness too, the CDC warns. “It’s one of the reasons that we are seeing kids transmitting more often than they did with the ancestral strain,” Shafir said. Kids are not just transmitting this variant more readily; they are getting sick themselves, a fact reflected in rising numbers of pediatric COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the US. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported more than 500,000 COVID-19 cases among children in the past two weeks. Still, experts say that in-person learning is important for kids’ development — as long as it can be done safely. “We’ve got to maintain the safety of the children as, at the same time, we provide them with an education in a way that does not hinder them in the way virtual learning does,” Dr. Anthony Fauci recently told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Layers of protection may prevent need for quarantines While quarantining can be a useful tool to respond to the spread of COVID-19 in schools, health experts say that when other preventive strategies are in place, it’s less likely that students will need to quarantine at all. Those strategies include masking, physical distancing, testing, improved ventilation and vaccination for those who are eligible. The COVID-19 vaccine is currently available for everyone ages 12 and up in the US. Los Angeles Unified Public Schools, the nation’s second largest school district, is requiring all eligible students to be vaccinated by the end of the calendar year. Students who decline the vaccine will be able to participate in an online study learning program. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb recently issued an executive order relaxing the quarantine requirement for students and staff who are close contacts of coronavirus-positive people — but only in schools that enforce mask mandates. President Joe Biden called on governors last week to require vaccination for all teachers and staff in schools, and announced funding to increase testing in schools. Regular testing can help ensure students don’t miss class time unnecessarily, former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said last week. He described how a “test-to-stay” strategy, which schools in states like Illinois and Kentucky are trying this year, can help prevent entire classrooms of people from having to quarantine. “There’s a whole movement around designing protocols that actually allow kids to stay in school, even after a positive case is turned over,” Gottlieb said. “Rather than quarantining large cohorts of children, what you do is you just implement serial testing around the exposure.” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says the goal is to create a safe environment for children in schools, with both masks and vaccination. “One of the most important ways is to surround the children with people who are vaccinated, if they’re eligible to be vaccinated — and that means teachers and personnel in the school,” he said.

But parents are asking when exactly the money will arrive. Last month’s check came on August 13 for those with direct deposit, or soon after for those dependent on the U.S. postal system. This month’s payment will be sent on September 15. Advance payments will continue next month and through the end of the year, thanks to the American Rescue Plan passed back in March. Democratic lawmakers are  looking to extend  the advance credit through 2025. Families can use the Child Tax Credit money however they like. That means the extra $250 or $300 per child can be put toward essentials like food or rent. It may also be spent on school supplies or a new computer, should COVID push students back into remote learning. Other households may apply the money toward piano lessons, daycare or even diapers. Regardless, the money comes at a time when much of the other pandemic aid —  most recently the extra unemployment insurance — has ended. Knowing that additional income is coming allows for a measure of security and flexibility in a world that’s full of surprises. How Much Should Your Check Be? READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The IRS is paying $3,600 total per child to parents of children up to five years of age. That drops to $3,000 for each child ages six through 17. Half of the total is being paid as six monthly payments and half as a 2021 tax credit. So each month through December parents of a younger child are receiving $300, and parents of an older child are receiving $250. The IRS has also made a one-time payment of $500 for dependents age 18 or full-time college students up through age 24.   Ready to join the millions of families who are now receiving monthly  #ChildTaxCredit  payments? An  #IRS  tool helps eligible families who receive little or no income submit the information needed to get advance payments. Visit  https://t.co/QsIMs56FuT   pic.twitter.com/lSj1RXy8Ux   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  September 14, 2021 The updated Child Tax Credit is based on parents’ modified adjusted gross income (AGI), as reflected on their 2020 tax filing. (AGI is the sum of one’s wages, interest, dividends, alimony, retirement distributions and other sources of income minus certain deductions, such as student loan interest, alimony payments and retirement contributions.) The amount  phases out  at a rate of $50 for every $1,000 of annual income beyond $75,000 for an individual and beyond $150,000 for a married couple. The benefit is fully refundable, meaning it does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. Qualifying families receive the full amount, regardless of what they owe in taxes. There is no limit to the number of dependents that can be claimed. For example, suppose a married couple has a three-year-old child and a seven-year-old child and showed an annual joint income of $120,000 on their 2020 taxes. The IRS is sending them $550 per month. That’s $300 per month ($3,600 / 12) for the younger child and $250 per month ($3,000 / 12) for the older child. Those payments will last through December. The couple would then receive the $3,300 balance — $1,800 ($300 X 6) for the younger child and $1,500 ($250 X 6) for the older child — as part of their 2021 tax refund. Parents of a child who ages out of an age bracket are paid the lesser amount. That means if a five-year-old turns six in 2021, the parents will receive a total credit of $3,000 for the year, not $3,600. Likewise, if a 17-year-old turns 18 in 2021, the parents are receiving $500, not $3,000. An income increase in 2021 to an amount above the $75,000 ($150,000) threshold could lower a household’s Child Tax Credit. The IRS has confirmed that they’ll soon allow claimants to adjust their income and custodial information online, thus lowering their payments. Failure to do so could increase one’s tax bill or reduce one’s tax refund once 2021 taxes are filed. Eligibility requires that the dependent be a part of the household for at least half of the year and be at least half supported by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who makes above $95,000 ($170,000) — where the Credit phases out entirely — will  not be eligible  for the expanded credit. But they can still claim the existing $2,000 credit per child. How Do You Make Changes For Future Payments? The IRS has three different tools to help recipients and potential recipients update their information on file, register and check eligibility. Child Tax Credit Update Portal READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The  Child Tax Credit Update Portal  allows users to make sure they are registered to receive advance payments. It also lets recipients unenroll from advance payments in favor of a one-time credit when filing their 2021 taxes. The deadline for the next payment was  August 30 . (Subsequent opt-out deadlines for future payments will occur three days before the first Thursday of the month from which a person is opting out.) Here are the remaining opt-out deadlines:   Payment Date: October 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: October 4   Payment Date: November 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 1   Payment Date: December 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 29   The tool also allows users to add or modify bank account information for direct deposit and view their payment history. Other features coming to the portal include updating one’s income, dependents, and address and reenrolling for monthly payments. To access this portal, users need an IRS username or an ID.me account. ID.me is a sign-in service used by various government agencies, including the IRS, Social Security Administration and Treasury Department, to authenticate users. Users need valid photo identification to create an account.   Some families may prefer to wait until the end of the year and receive the entire  #ChildTaxCredit  instead of receiving advance payments. An  #IRS  tool lets them do just that:  https://t.co/Qt9TAuwjvv   pic.twitter.com/eXkAzTWzdp   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  September 13, 2021 Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool The  Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool  is to help parents of children born before 2021 who don’t typically file taxes but qualify for advance Child Tax Credit payments. That means parents who have not filed their 2020 taxes, are not required to file, and don’t plan to file. (Parents who claimed their dependents on their 2019 tax return should not use this tool.) Users enter their personal information, including their name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, relevant social security numbers, bank account information, and identity protection PIN. The IRS uses the information to check eligibility and, once confirmed, will begin making payments. The IRS and experts advise using the tool on a desktop or laptop computer rather than a mobile device. Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant The  Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant  lets parents check if they are eligible to receive advance Child Tax Credit payments. Users will need a copy of their 2020 tax return or, barring that, their 2019 tax return. It’s also fine to estimate income and expenses from the appropriate tax year, though the result may not be accurate. The assistant asks multiple questions to determine eligibility, but does not ask for sensitive information. No entries are recorded.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,094 new COVID-19 cases and 15 deaths, according to state health department data released Tuesday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .14% to 4.61%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 26, to 828. Of those hospitalized, 622 remain in acute care and 206 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 512,740 total confirmed cases and 9,979 deaths. There are 3,810,647 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,691,908 doses. Of those, 3,881,261 are first doses with 3,917 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,514,592 second doses, 4,049 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 296,055 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 342 in the last day. The state reported 82.2% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 14,006 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Sunday, Sept. 5.

(WJZ) —  Howard County officials say so far this year, the overdose-reversing drug, Narcan, was administered in every case of non-fatal overdoses.       It’s exactly what Howard County park rangers, Ian Smith and Tabitha Kanagie had on hand when responding to a 9-1-1 call at Rockburn Branch Park in Elkridge on August 9th.     “Because of that, we were able to g i ve these fam i l i es back the i r loved ones,” said Tab i tha Ka n ag i e, Park Ra n ger.     “We the two men, we were told by family they were taking drugs, we administered naloxone and began administering CPR and fortunately were able to resuscitate them,” Ian Smith, Park Ranger.     The reversing drug Naloxone, better known as Narcan, comes in the form of a nasal spray and can quickly halt the deadly effects of narcotics, essentially bringing people back from an overdose in a matter of minutes.       “It shuts off the opioid  r ecepto r s in the b r ain. It’s administe r ed nasally and wo r ks about five minutes. It’s ve r y small, we keep it on our duty belt at all times,” said Smith. “They don’t need to be breathing for it to work, it absorbs through the mucous membranes.”           “Anything can  r eally happen at any moment in any place and you just have to be p r epa r ed,” said Kanagie.       That’s why first responders are hoping to get the drug in the hands of more people who need it.     “People with the  r ight t r aining in the  r ight place at the  r ight time can make all the diffe r ence, and that doesn’t need to be someone like me, it can be anyone, said Smith.       The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges to those facing substance abuse.     “During  a time when we were all physically distant, when there was a great deal of uncertainty, increase in anxiety, a lot of the support systems for those who were suffering with substance abuse disorder were not there….  a lot of people suffered in silence and suffered alone,” said Calvin Ball,  Howa r d County Executive.     In Howard County from 2019 to 2020, data shows a 43-percent increase in opioid-related deaths. So far this year, that number is down 70-percent from last year.     “The sto r ies put faces to these opioid numbe r s and illust r ate how the p r epa r edness of ou r  gove r nment and ou r  community to conf r ont the epidemic is p r oving successful,” said Ball.   While officials say Narcan can’t completely solve the opioid crisis, it can be a vital component for recovery.         “Feeling his pulse start in my hand, and seeing his eyes open up, it’s going to be something I’m going to remember for the rest of my life,” said Smith.     Howard County has a free opioid overdose response program that offers monthly virtual training on how to identify and respond to opioid overdoses, all attendees receive a Narcan kit.

(WJZ)  — By a vote of 10 to 7, a Maryland General Assembly joint committee approved a mask mandate for all public schools in the state. Sen. Sarah K. Elfreth (D-Anne Arundel County), co-chair of the committee, said the measure took effect immediately. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The state Board of Education on Aug. 26 adopted an emergency regulation requiring masks to be worn in all public schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19. A majority of the board voted in favor of the measure, which lasts for 180 days. There was one vote in opposition. The General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review, comprised of 10 senators and 10 delegates, heard four hours of testimony on Tuesday from supporters and opponents of the state school board’s mask requirement.   The Maryland school mask mandate goes into effect immediately. In central Maryland, every school district except Carroll County already had a mask mandate in place. Lawmakers heard from several Carroll County parents on both sides of the issue.  @wjz   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  September 14, 2021 Prior to today’s vote, 22 of 24 Maryland school districts already required masks be worn at all times, but Carroll County was one of the few school systems where masks were optional. “Masking inside schools helps protect our students, teachers and school staff as we continue to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic,” State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury said following the vote. “It is critical that all school systems follow this emergency law, and immediately implement face covering requirements as one of several layered public health strategies to keep schools open and safe.” Following the vote, Republican senators on the committee released a statement saying they were “disappointed” by what they called an “overreach and political power grab.” The mask mandate takes away the authority of local school boards to listen to parents and make their own decisions, the senators said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It is a one-size-fits-all approach that does not account for the variation in educational settings and COVID-19 metrics found throughout the state or allow for local flexibility to act and react quickly to changing metrics,” the Republican lawmakers said. “It is an inappropriate overreach for the State Board of Education to reverse a local board’s decision and then require that local board to enforce a mandate or risk their funding.” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) praised the vote in a statement Tuesday afternoon, calling the measure a “common-sense mask requirement” that comes as students and teachers are already back in the classroom. “We know mask wearing helps slow the spread of COVID-19 and my goal has been to keep as many kids learning in school as possible,” he said. Marsha Herbert, president of the Board of Education of Carroll County, said the district would comply with the mandate. But she also said she was “disappointed and disheartened” by the committee’s decision. “Several of our Board members and many of our Carroll County citizens presented compelling testimony as to why this is not a good decision,” Herbert said in a statement. “Today’s action definitely takes away local control and strongly affects parent choice.” This story will be updated .

Lawmakers heard from several Carroll County parents on both sides of the issue.  @wjz   — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ)  September 14, 2021 READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “I think it sets up a very slippery slope for the Maryland state board of education to undo local decisions,” said Delegate Haven Schoemaker, a Republican from Carroll County.  Carroll County had been the only school system in central Maryland without a mask mandate.  “Where is the emergency? There is a real cost to forcing students to wear masks for seven hours a day—day after day—and it isn’t being acknowledged,” said Carroll County School Board member Donna Sivigny.  Carroll County School Board President Marsha Herbert called a state mask mandate “overreach”  One parent told the legislative committee, “None of you should be leaders of anything, let alone an entire state! The fact that you want to place 5-year-olds in masks for 7 to 8 hours at a time is sickening,”  But Carroll County parent Maureen Aversa told lawmakers, “Covid doesn’t care if you’re a Carroll County girl. Covid doesn’t discriminate.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Please enact this mask mandate. Please help keep my kids safe,” Matthew Stubblefield, another parent from Carroll County, pleaded with lawmakers.  In Baltimore County, where the school system has already mandated masks, the head of the teachers’ union says the requirement is working. “Students are wearing them when they’re supposed to. If they need a break, they pull it down for a minute and put it back up, but masking seems to be going very well,” said TABCO president Cindy Sexton. She also supports the system’s vaccination policy for teachers and support staff. Senate President Bill Ferguson laments how divided people are but tells WJZ requiring masks is about safety.  “I wish it had happened earlier. What happened today was common sense. We want to keep kids in school. We need to do whatever it takes to keep them in school, in person,” Ferguson told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren.  The state school board says no decision has been made on whether to mandate vaccines for those students who are eligible. “The state of emergency was lifted, but the Delta variant has changed the game,” said Mohammed Choudhury, the state superintendent of schools, on the necessity of a mask mandate. “… Maryland was third from last on re-opening. It is not a stat to be proud of, and it is not a stat that I plan to go back to. Masking enables us to keep the vast majority of our children in school especially when there is a positive case or outbreak.“ MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government State school officials said they would periodically reassess the necessity of a mask mandate as cases rise and fall.

It was that kind of night for Baltimore’s secondary. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The Ravens arrived in Las Vegas determined to show that they could still play to their usual standard despite a rash of preseason injuries. Instead,  Baltimore fell 33-27  to the Raiders in overtime — and it was hard not to think about the missing players who could have helped. Much of the attention lately has been on Baltimore’s backfield, which was ravaged by season-ending injuries to J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards. But the secondary was hurting too with Marcus Peters (knee) gone for the year and Jimmy Smith (ankle) out for this game. Derek Carr threw for 435 yards and two touchdowns for Las Vegas, and with the game on the line, the Ravens could do little to slow the Raiders. Las Vegas scored on four of its final five possessions, and the one stop by Baltimore came on a fluky interception that caromed to Anthony Averett in the end zone in overtime. “I was very, very happy with the team’s effort. The toughness, the resiliency, fighting back,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. “Even there at the end, the example is the goal-line stand, those are the kind of things that make us who we are as a team. We just didn’t close the game out when we had the opportunity to do it, three or four times.” That interception gave the Ravens new life, but the offense couldn’t take advantage, and when Lamar Jackson lost a fumble for the second time in the game, Baltimore was on the ropes again. Carr ended it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Zay Jones. “That ticked me off. I hate fumbles,” Jackson said. “I hate any type of turnover.” The Ravens led 14-0 at one point and took a 27-24 lead on Justin Tucker’s field goal with 37 seconds remaining — only for the defense to allow two quick completions, which put Las Vegas in position for a long field goal that forced overtime. WHAT’S WORKING Baltimore’s big priority this offseason was shoring up the passing game, and newly acquired receiver Sammy Watkins had a nice night with four catches for 96 yards. Jackson had a quarterback rating of 118.8. WHAT NEEDS HELP The Raiders certainly used tight end Darren Waller effectively, targeting him 19 times. He caught 10 passes for 105 yards and a touchdown, but by the end of the game, the Ravens were having trouble covering anyone. Baltimore allowed 327 yards of offense after halftime. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We have a lot of fight and a lot of heart, but we have a lot of room for improvement,” defensive end Calais Campbell said. “Where we’re at right now, I just feel like this was a tough one.” STOCK UP Ty’Son Williams ran for 65 yards on nine carries in his NFL debut and broke free for a 35-yard touchdown. He also had three catches for 29 yards. Despite all the injuries, the Ravens rushed for at least 100 yards for a 40th consecutive game. They are now three games shy of the record set by the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 1970s. Baltimore did release running back Trenton Cannon on Tuesday. STOCK DOWN It wasn’t a great night for the offensive line, which allowed three sacks — including  the one  that caused Jackson’s second fumble. “Sometimes you can’t go through your reads, you got to make something happen,” Jackson said. “That’s what I tried doing on that last one. I saw it breaking down, try to push a lineman, try to get out of the pocket and he hit me while I’m doing it. So, I’ll try and hold onto the ball next time.” INJURIES Offensive lineman Tyre Phillips was carted off with a knee injury and did not return. He was put on injured reserve Tuesday. KEY NUMBER 98 — Before Monday, the Ravens had won 98 straight games in the regular season when leading by at least 14 points. NEXT STEPS The next test for the Ravens and their struggling secondary figures to be even harder. They host Kansas City on Sunday night. Between now and then, Baltimore will need to evaluate the veteran running backs the team brought in recently. Le’Veon Bell and Devonta Freeman have been on the practice squad. Latavius Murray was active and had 10 carries for 28 yards and a touchdown Monday.

Torres followed by making a tough pickup on Pedro Severino’s grounder, stepping on second and throwing to first for a double play. Torres was removed for a defensive replacement in the eighth.

(AP)  — This week Maryland plays at Illinois for the first time in program history — which says a lot about how new the Terrapins still are to the Big Ten. However, the Terps do have a couple coaches who are plenty familiar with the Illinois program. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Maryland’s Michael Locksley was an offensive coordinator at Illinois from 2005-08. Special teams coach Ron Zook was the head coach at Illinois from 2005-11. They’ll be back there Friday night when the Terrapins open their Big Ten schedule on the road against the Illini. “For me and my family, a special place. Raised my kids there. My two older sons both graduated from high school there, and the two younger ones call it home,” Locksley said Tuesday. “We were able to do some exciting things there.” Locksley coached under Zook at Illinois — it’s the other way around now — and the Illini went 1-15 in the Big Ten in Zook’s first two seasons. Then they went to the Rose Bowl. Locksley would love a similar upturn in his third year as Maryland’s coach. The Terps beat West Virginia in their opener, then drubbed Howard 62-0 last weekend. Maryland now will try to win its Big Ten opener for the first time since 2018. The Terps lost their last two conference openers by a combined score of 102-3. There are a half-dozen Big Ten teams Maryland had never played before 2014, when the Terps joined the league. Illinois is one of them. The only meeting between the teams so far was in 2018, when Maryland beat the visiting Illini 63-33. “This is the first time obviously for Maryland to go there to play — which completes us now having been to every team in the Big Ten, with an away game,” Locksley said. “It starts Big Ten play, which is another season for us, different than the out-of-conference games. It’s a Big Ten opener, national TV audience, so it will be the show.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Illinois already has a Big Ten victory under its belt. The Illini opened the season with a win over Nebraska. That game was on Aug. 28, a week before much of the country began playing. “Good team, play with energy. Their home crowd really gets into the game, which is important,” Maryland linebacker Ruben Hyppolite said. “That’s just going to allow us to up our focus more.” The Illini are reeling a bit now. After the victory over Nebraska, they lost to Texas-San Antonio and Virginia. As for the connections between Locksley, Zook and Illinois, Locksley says that hasn’t really been a major issue so far this week. “We haven’t really even discussed it,” he said. “When you have a short week like this, when the turnaround is pretty quick — fortunately for us, with the way we’re staffed and the way we’re organized, we were able to get the scouting reports out a day early, were able to get them done Sunday. Had good meetings with our players, and then went out and had a Monday practice Sunday night.” Still, Locksley’s stop at Illinois was an important step in the Maryland coach’s career. Prior to that, he had mainly been a position coach at the college level. “It’s the first time I had a chance to be a coordinator, and not surprising that a guy like Ron Zook would give me that opportunity, at 36 years old, to run the offense. We did some really good things, year three were able to take a team to the Rose Bowl,” Locksley said. “But again, those things are in the past. This is the ‘21 Terps, the ’21 Illini.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Newton said that Facebook’s internal research demonstrated the company’s commitment to “understanding complex and difficult issues young people may struggle with, and informs all the work we do to help those experiencing these issues.” According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook researchers concluded that some problems with teen mental health were specific to Instagram, and not social media more broadly, especially when it comes to “social comparison.” That’s when users focus on how their wealth, appearance or success stacks up against other people on the platform. The research has been reviewed by top Facebook executives, according to The Journal, and was cited in a 2020 presentation given to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Newton said in her blog post on Tuesday that Instagram is “increasingly focused on addressing negative social comparison and negative body image.” One idea is to prompt users to look at different topics when they repeatedly view content of that kind.

That might not be enough to appease critics. Facebook reaffirmed in July in that it was moving forward with plans to build an  Instagram for kids  under the age of 13 despite significant opposition from parents and lawmakers in Washington. Sen. Richard Blumenthal , a Democrat from Connecticut, said Tuesday that The Journal’s report demonstrates that Facebook has known for years of Instagram’s “damaging effect on young people,” and that its own employees’ warnings were “shoved aside in favor of growth.” “I’m appalled and alarmed by Facebook’s targeting of teens with dangerous products while hiding the science of its toxic impact,” he said on Twitter. “Through hearings and legislation my Commerce subcommittee will act to protect children and support parents.” If you or someone you know might be at risk of suicide, here are ways to help: Call 1-800-273-8255 to reach the  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline .

The movie marks his directorial debut and it features a great cast with names like Judy Greer, Melanie Lynskey and Luis Guzmán. The movie is about a woman named Hannah who is trying to put her life back together and gets a job as a tour guide at a historic estate. Hannah ends up befriending the manor’s resident ghost named Lady Wadsworth and the wild story goes on from there. CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith recently spoke to Long about what it was like to direct for the first time, what he remembers from doing “Dodgeball” with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn and working with Jonah Hill in “Accepted.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Melanie Lynskey plays a tour guide at this estate where she pretends to be a lady who lived there in the 1870s,” said Long. “Melanie doesn’t really have her life together and Judy Greer plays the ghost of the lady she is portraying. The ghost takes offense at how Melanie is living her life and what she is doing in her old bedroom and starts haunting her in an annoying way, not a scary way. We came up with it because my brother and I have always loved oddball couples.” “We loved What About Bob and Planes, Trains & Automobiles,” said Long. “Those were the movies that inspired us growing up. We knew we wanted that as the structure, with that classic oddball couple pairing. We had had an idea a couple of years earlier about a comedic psycho. We came up with this and it is more of an oddball couple comedy than anything else. It’s more of a buddy comedy.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Lady of the Manor” will be in select theaters and will be available everywhere you can rent movies on September 17. It will also be available on Blu-Ray and DVD on September 21. Long says the casting was key for this film because Lynskey and Greer are seasoned pros and barely needed any guidance from him on set as the director. The actor, writer and director has had the opportunity to be around some of the best performers in Hollywood and one of his big breaks came when he played Justin in the 2004 hit movie “Dodgeball.” “I never had super lofty ambitions,” said Long. “The fact that I was in any movie was such a thrill right away. This is going to sound nuts, but my agents at the time were recommending that I should do this other job. It was this college movie, but it kind of went straight to video. I had been offered it and Dodgeball was not a concrete offer, so I had to make a decision. The director Rawson Thurber wrote the part for me, but the studio felt that I was too old for the part, which they were right about.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “I was 24 at the time and Justin was written as a 15-year-old, so I was too old for it,” said Long. “Rawson had written a character named Justin and it was really flattering because he had seen an episode of a TV show I had done called Ed. He wrote it for me. I talked to him and he said I can’t guarantee it. I ended up passing on the other movie in the hopes that this movie would work out. That movie really changed my professional life. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn were heroes of mine and comedic icons and guys I really admired. Getting to play with them and be in the sandbox with them was such a thrill.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.15936768149882902, "subjectivity": 0.41250975800156126, "wordcount": 678}

(WJZ) —  The Talbot County Council on Tuesday night voted 3-2 to take down the Talbot Boys monument and relocate the statue to a battlefield in Harrisonburg, Va., according to  a report from CBS affiliate WBOC . Council members Pete Lesher, Frank Divilio and Corey W. Pack voted in favor of the move, with Laura E. Price and Chuck F. Callahan opposed, the station said. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured On Facebook, Divilio said the American Battlefield Trust would move monument to the Cross Keys Battlefield, part of the Shenandoah Valley Campaign in 1862–“a series of battles where Talbot County blood was shed on both sides.” He said the monument would tell the story of familial conflicts during the war, pointing to the story of William Goldsborough, who was involved in capture of his own brother, Charles, during that campaign. “If the Talbot Boys make this move, they will help tell the story of the Civil War and how communities and families were divided, unfortunately, much as we are today,” he wrote. Divilio, who previously was against moving the Talbot Boys statue, said the battle over the monument’s fate has prevented the council from addressing other issues, such as the response to COVID-19, increasing better broadband access and cellphone coverage, and providing permits. “The Talbot Boys issue has divided our community for too long and has sidelined many other important things the County Council and County Government needs to address,” he said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn No local government, organization or business stepped forward to accept the Talbot Boys memorial, he added. In May, the local branch of the NAACP  filed a federal lawsuit  to remove the monument from the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse. The statue, depicting a young solider carrying a Confederate battle flag, is believed to be the last monument to the Confederacy remaining on public property in the state besides cemeteries and battlefields. Dedicated in 1916, the statue also includes the names of 84 local men who fought for the Confederacy. Advocates for keeping the statue in place have  argued  it represents U.S. history. The county council in August 2020 voted 3-2 to let the memorial remain. In response to last night’s vote, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, who had previously  called  for the statue’s removal, simply tweeted, “Good riddance.”   Good riddance.  https://t.co/YG4ld3HujR   — Brian Frosh (@BrianFrosh)  September 15, 2021 In a statement, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, another proponent of removal, said the monument’s placement outside the courthouse embodies “injustice and inequality,” adding that it was erected more than 50 years after the end of the war during the era of racist Jim Crow laws.

The company was awarded a municipal contract in 2012 but continued to auction off vehicles for the Department of Transportation and Department of General Services after the agreement expired and was not renewed by the Board of Estimates, the report said. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured In 2019, the Law Department filed a lawsuit against the company for $575,299 in missing revenue from four auctions the year prior and received a series of “good faith” payments totaling $70,000. After delays, the city last May agreed to accept $25,000 to dismiss the lawsuit. City Solicitor James L. Shea, in a response letter, said the city took the smaller settlement after the owner of the company, who lives out of state, threatened to declare bankruptcy in Virginia. The report detailed a “lack of controls” over the agreement with the auction company, such as letting the business collect and deposit bids–mostly paid in cash–without city oversight and missing records on both the part of the auctioneer and city agencies. The auction company, which goes unnamed in the report, also deposited proceeds into its own account, rather than a city account, the report said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn According to the report, the mayor appoints members to the three-person Auction Advisory Board to interview applicants and approve licenses to conduct auctions in the city. The board can also investigate any auctioneers who violates city code. But when Baltimore City agencies requested a hearing to revoke the license of the auction company in question, the board did not have three members, and the “de facto chairperson” was a mentor to the owner of the auction company and former employee. With his license still intact, the owner of the auction company continued to hold private auctions in the city, the report said. Shea agreed in his letter that the city needs to improve oversight of contracts to auction city property and said new Auction Advisory Board members must be appointed by the mayor and approved by the city council.

The cast includes a fire captain, crop duster, lineman, and ironworker, among others. Phil Keoghan is the creator, host and showrunner. These competitors who are the best of the best in their chosen trades and come from different walks of life, but all roll up their sleeves every day to make an honest day’s living, will kick off the third season from Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base in Southern California, when season one’s winner, Marine veteran Kelly “Murph” Murphy, returns to lead the crews through a series of military-style challenges. Throughout the season, crews will have to complete their jobs at other renowned locations, including Mt. Baldy, the highest peak in Los Angeles, the U.S. Coast Guard in San Pedro, and the  Irwindale Speedway, a motorsports facility,  leading to one competitor being crowned the champion and winning the coveted  Tough As Nails  belt.

Pew researchers surveyed 10,348 adults in the US between August 23 and 29. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Most adults say that restrictions on public activity during the pandemic hurt economic activity and kept people from living life the way they want to, but the majority also believe those restrictions have helped slow the spread of the virus and its consequences. Ultimately, 62% say the public health benefits of restrictions are worth the cost, while 37% say they are not. Though 72% of adults say they now personally know someone who has been hospitalized or died from Covid-19, 54% believe the worst of the outbreak is still to come. Black and Hispanic people are most likely to know someone who has been hospitalized or died. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Fewer people are now wearing masks, the report suggests, with 53% saying they mask up in stores and businesses, down from 88% in February, when mask requirements were more widespread. In July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors when in areas with “substantial” and “high” transmission of Covid-19, which at the time included nearly two-thirds of all US counties. The  latest CDC data  now finds 95% of all US counties are considered to be in areas with “substantial” or “high” transmission levels. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The CDC had previously revised its guidance in May for vaccinated people to unmask before the explosion of the Delta variant. But the Pew report also found about 80% of adults say they believe mask requirements on airplanes and public transportation are necessary to address the spread of the virus, and that international travel should be restricted. Last week, the top fine for violating transportation face mask requirement doubled. The civil penalties will now range from $500 to $3,000, the Department of Homeland Security said. The previous range was $250 to $1,500. The face mask requirement is now in place through mid-January and applies to airplanes, trains and buses, as well as hubs like airports and train terminals. Other support for Covid-19 restrictions Half say that restaurants should be limited to takeout only, and 48% say that schools should be closed for in-person learning. Public health recommendations have changed throughout the pandemic, along with the science, and 61% say the changes make sense. A little over half say the changes reassure them that officials are listening to new information. But not everyone is reassured. About 55% say the changes make them question whether officials are withholding information, 53% say they prompted confusion and 51% say they lessened confidence in officials’ recommendations.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,189 new COVID-19 cases and 11 deaths, according to state health department data released Wednesday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .07% to 4.54%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 9, to 819. Of those hospitalized, 622 remain in acute care and 206 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 513,929 total confirmed cases and 9,990 deaths. There are 3,816,826 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,703,134 doses. Of those, 3,886,308 are first doses with 5,047 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,520,313 second doses, 5,721 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 296,513 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 458 in the last day. The state reported 82.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

The FBI can help, but only if we know about the crime. That’s why we are spreading the word with this campaign,” said Thomas J. Sobocinski, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Baltimore Field Office.  “Violent acts motivated by hate have no place in our society. Every person has the right to live without fear of violence or intimidation and we will continue to hold those accountable whose hate-filled aggression violates the civil rights of another individual.” The FBI said a  2020 Hate Crime Report  found that in Maryland, 68% of reported bias incidents were race or ethnicity-motivated. Of those, victims who were perceived as black were the most targeted, according to the report.

In his latest book “ Show Them You’re Good ,” Hobbs follows four boys in the vast Los Angles school system as they seek admission to college and begin to discover their adult selves. The four subjects Hobbs writes about all have fascinating journeys and backstories. Carlos is the son of undocumented delivery workers and is trying to follow in the footsteps of his older brother who went to an Ivy League school. Tio is a kid who has dreams of becoming an engineer, but his father doesn’t believe in him. Then there is Jon who battles the sky high expectations of his mother and Owen who struggles to get serious about his academics. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith spoke with Hobbs about the book, what it was like to go back to school and follow these four boys and his memories from writing his New York Times bestseller “The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace” about his former Yale classmate who passed away. “Show Them You’re Good” is available now wherever books are sold. “I spent about a year going to school every day with high school seniors in 2016 and the 2017 school year,” said Hobbs. “I was raising my own young kids at that time and long story short, it was a lot of fun. It gave me a lot of hope, which was sort of the intention to begin with. The main surprise was that any of these kids wanted to hang out with me during a year when they were applying to college. They devoted a specific amount of time each week in a roundtable format to talk about what was going on in their lives.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn One of the biggest things that stuck out to Hobbs during his interactions with the kids was how worldly, wise, funny and touching they were. The author says one of his biggest goals of this book was to make it human. He was motivated to prove why society shouldn’t just put people in boxes based on what they see on the surface. “My kind of work with narrative non-fiction is always to undermine presumptions and I think these kids undermined a lot of presumptions of Beverly Hills and South LA,” said Hobbs. “The idea of perspective has always been important, but it is becoming more and more important regarding who gets to tell the story. The vast amount of stories are told by overeducated white men like me, so it’s tricky.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “You mentioned Robert Peace and that was sort of a memoir slash biography of a close friend of mine who died almost 10 years ago,” said Hobbs. “I reached out to Rob’s family after he died and we were all struggling to process. I thought I could write a little compilation of stories for his high school newsletter or some 1,000 word piece that spoke to his life and not just his death.

Photo Courtesy of CBS   READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured It’s been 20 years of me watching this wildly adventurous, strategic reality show, and one thing I miss the most about watching it as a kid is our family  Survivor  pools. That’s why, this year, I’m bringing it back! When the first season of  Survivor  premiered, I was just around seven years old. My dad and the family business would host a “ Survivor  pool” where we’d all have to draw a name in hopes our castaway would Outwit, Outplay and Outlast the rest. Back then, during the Richard Hatch and Ethan Zohn days, things were pretty basic – dial-up internet, ya know, the simple life. So simple, we didn’t have a “downloadable version” of a  Survivor  pool template – my dad would have to make his own board from scratch. Doing it old-school can be fun and all, but now as we’re older – convenience is necessary. As mentioned by host  Jeff Probst ,  Survivor  is entering a brand-new era this season. With previews of all crazy twists and numerous mentions of this so-called, hungry “monster,” it’s pretty clear –  Survivor 41  is a must-watch. But before we dive into this wild season, I’ve created a free downloadable (and editable)  Survivor 41  pool template for you and your viewing party to use! How to Get Your Digital  Survivor 41  Pool Template: Access the Google  Survivor 41  Template here   Best in Desktop or Google Sheets App  1.  File  –>  Make a Copy  and edit your template online ✓  2.  Download to PDF   & Print  (optional) ✓  3. Share with your viewing party! ✓   Photo Credit: Mickie McLeod   This year, my pool consists of 8 of us, so that means we’ll each get two castaways – with two of the castaways as wild cards (which will be given to my adorable toddler nieces). Or, another idea is to use this template to host a LIVE Draft before the premiere. You can, of course, make up your own rules and edit the template according to your pool. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn How to Customize Your Template: Fill in your names under the B column (You can copy & paste another row if you need to add more names)  Generate your castaway: hold and highlight all of the castaway names under column C → right-click → and press  “randomize range”  (you must highlight only the names)   Photo Credit: Mickie McLeod   Or, if you’re really old-school, draw your names out of a hat and manually enter your designated castaway into your copy of the template. Survivor  season 41 will be pretty unpredictable, to say the least. And, because of a shorter game this season (spanning only 26 out of the usual 39 days), the game will be even more dangerous at this much faster pace. If the schedule holds the same as the recent fall seasons, the finale and reunion special should air sometime in December. I’m expecting this season to feel like a brand-new game. I mean, with an unknown, “themeless” season (as of right now) and the mysterious talks about the “monster,” – we’re definitely entering a new age of  Survivor. Until then, have fun getting the gang together virtually, or in person if you can.  Survivor  has always brought my family together and still does to this day – I hope it does the same for you! Tune in to the two-hour premiere,  Wednesday, September 22nd  at 8/7c on CBS, as well as streaming live and on-demand with  Paramount+  or the CBS App!

(CBS Boston) –  The five-day work week is as American as apple pie, but in recent years, it’s been called into question. Turning the weekend into a three-day period is something that’s been tossed around by some experts and even the subject of various studies. Now, one company says giving its employees an extra day off has actually wound up making them even more money. In May of 2020,  Dockwa , a marina reservation app that connects boaters and marinas across the country, did away with the dreaded Monday workday. It doesn’t look like they’ll be returning down that road anytime soon. “We wanted to combat employee burnout,” says Jessica Palmer, VP of People Operations. “We realized that the state of the world was changing, and we really wanted to make sure that our employees were present, that they remained happy.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The start-up company has offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. They say since switching to a four-day work week, the numbers speak for themselves. “What we found was in the year after we implemented the change, we saw nearly 100% year over year growth in ARR, which is revenue. We were able to do that in spite of working fewer hours,” says Meghan Anderson, Chief Marketing Officer. “I don’t see a world where I could go really go back to a five-day work week,” adds Austin Schofield, Marina Success Manager. Pay and time off were not affected for Dockwa’s 50 employees, who have been noticeably happier and more productive when they’re on the clock. “Dive right into Tuesday and having that compressed week really keeps you a lot more focused and optimizes your time and just operating more efficiently,” says Schofield. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn So while Dockwa helps their customers enjoy the outdoors, it’s something their employees can do more of now too with more free time. “Being able to sort of walk that walk with its own employees and allow them to close their devices, get offline, get out into the world, I think it really bodes well for the values of the company,” says Anderson. The model has also attracted new employees to work there. “I started with the company in February of last year and it was a major factor in why I chose the role. I’m a parent, I’ve got a four-year-old daughter. Having Monday off allows me to have just a little bit of time back for my own sanity,” Anderson adds.

Unfortunately, many women delayed those routine tests during the pandemic. “Finding breast cancer early just changes the course of survival,” said Dr. Schultz. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Dr. Michael Shultz is the Director of Breast Health at Lifebridge with more than 45 years of treating patients in Baltimore. Understandably, many women held off on their yearly mammograms once the pandemic hit and nationally, there’s been an increase in more serious forms of breast cancers. “Now, we’re in a sea of advanced breast cancers. We’ll still treat and the majority will do well but they would have done better if they had gotten them done last year,” Dr. Schultz said. The conversation became a national one when Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar shared that she had also delayed her routine mammogram later to find out she had stage one breast cancer, something that thankfully was very treatable. “You just don’t know what is lurking there,” said Klobuchar.

She urges women to be proactive early on. “There may be something in the breast that you don’t feel that the mammogram will show up and it’s important to be able to see it ahead of time so that you can basically do preventive measures for it,” said Hurtt. Lifebridge Health has an annual mammothon coming up on Nov. 10. — an all-day breast cancer screening event with extended hours at multiple locations — no referrals necessary.

The homer came soon after second baseman Gleyber Torres knocked down a hard liner and instead of throwing to second to get the lead runner, tossed to first to put out Cedric Mullins. Orioles reliever Tyler Wells (2-3) walked Luke Voit to begin the ninth and Torres followed with a single. Pinch-runner Tyler Wade and Torres pulled off a double steal with one out as it began to rain. Gardner followed with a single to center that scored both runs, much to the delight of their fans that flocked to Camden Yards.

Urshela took over as the full-time shortstop this week for the error-prone Torres and had a diving catch off a hard liner by Austin Wynns for the final out in the fifth. Mullins took a two-run homer away from Gary Sanchez in the second with a leaping grab over the center-field fence. Orioles starter John Means pointed to Mullins in celebration and Sanchez walked back to the dugout in disbelief. Means had another effective outing and allowed two runs and four hits with four strikeouts and two walks in 5 2/3 innings.

(WJZ) —  A Glen Burnie man was arrested last week after police said he intentionally hit a crossing guard with his car and new video sheds a light on the incident — which raises some questions in the police report. New video released captured the incident Thursday morning at the intersection of Shetlands Lane and Tam O Shanter Glen in which police say 32-year-old Joe Hernandez assaulted a school crossing guard by intentionally hitting her with his blue Tesla. READ MORE:  Impatient Driver Hits Crossing Guard With Vehicle In Glen Burnie, Police Say But the security video captured by a neighbor seems to show otherwise. “When I first looked through it, I didn’t see it. Like I missed it. I didn’t know it was an incident,” said Howard Wang, captured incident on security camera. In the video, you can see Hernandez in his blue tesla fully stopped. The crossing guard motions him forward to let a car pass by, then he stops again. Moments later, the crossing guard is seen backing up near his bumper. Then, Hernandez backs followed by an exchange of words. A police officer walks over, more words are exchanged and Hernandez drives away. “No, no, no. It doesn’t even look like she got hurt at all. Cause she was normal afterward. She continued to do her job afterwards,” said Wang. Wang, who’s security video captured the incident, told WJZ he doesn’t think Hernandez did anything wrong. “I don’t think she got hit. Because if you look at the video. She was up against the bumper. Like before the car even moved,” said Wang.”He had his wheel turned. So he straightened the wheel and then backed up at the same time, that’s probably what she felt. That’s it.” Charging documents reveal that Hernandez is charged with seven violations — including reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to render aid to an injured person. “I was surprised they filed a police report and he got arrested,” said Wang. When asked if she still stands by her story, the unidentified crossing guard had this to say, “I’m not going to say anything, everything speaks for itself.” Hernandez’s attorney said the charges are entirely false.

That’s how it looked Wednesday night at Camden Yards as the Orioles clung to a one-run lead in the ninth inning over the New York Yankees. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Ready to roll out the tarp from beyond first base, nearly 20 members of the grounds crew were standing in foul territory in front of the first row of seats, waiting for a signal. What they saw was acting umpire crew chief  Tim Timmons cutting across the diamond  from his spot at third base, emphatically waving several times for them to completely clear the field. Quickly, the crew scrambled down the right field line, into the corner and out of sight. Were they chirping too much? Were they trying too hard to get busy and protect Baltimore’s edge? Were they tossed? Naw, naw and naw, Timmons said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I didn’t ‘eject’ the grounds crew,” Timmons said in a text to The Associated Press. “I just didn’t want all of them behind the tarp, especially with the infield in.” So on what soon became a wet night, the Baltimore brigade kept its record spotless, and didn’t join mascots and stadium organists on the list of strange ballpark ejections over the years. This scene unfolded with the Orioles ahead 3-2, runners on second and third, and Brett Gardner batting with one out. After the crew scurried away, Gardner fouled off three pitches before blooping a two-run single that gave the Yankees a 4-3 win. It began to rain about five minutes later. The field was never covered and the game finished without incident.

(AP) —  Fresh off a startling loss at Las Vegas, Baltimore’s shaky secondary will now focus on a familiar nemesis: Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. “The Chiefs have definitely had our number the past couple years,” cornerback Marlon Humphrey said. “I guess the way you go about changing it is just addressing it, how it is, looking at it head on, and going into the game and just trying to beat them.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured For a half Monday night, the Ravens looked ready to face whatever Mahomes might throw at them, but then the Raiders rallied for a 33-27 overtime win. Las Vegas scored on four of its final five possessions. The Ravens allowed 409 net yards passing, the most by a Baltimore opponent since 2017. That total was inflated a bit because the game went into overtime, but it was still concerning. “They just capitalized on really what we did, mistake-wise,” Humphrey said. “We had some things with effort, some things with just lining up incorrectly. They really took advantage of it.” Since the start of the 2018 season, Baltimore is 35-14 in the regular season — but that mark includes an 0-3 record against the Chiefs. The 2018 matchup went to overtime, and the following year, the Ravens lost 33-28 after trailing by as many as 17 points. Last season Baltimore lost 34-20. Mahomes has been remarkably consistent against the Ravens, throwing for 377, 374 and 385 yards in those three games. “When you look at the teams that beat the Chiefs, it’s a lot of plays that the Chiefs get away with that should be made. The teams that beat them just make those plays,” Humphrey said. “When it’s like, ‘Oh the Chiefs made this crazy play.’ And they make so many big, crazy plays. But the biggest thing is you’ve got to tackle their skill and make the plays you’re supposed to make.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Humphrey issued a bit of a mea culpa when asked about possible late hits on Las Vegas receiver Hunter Renfrow. “I did hit Hunter Renfrow a little after the play,” Humphrey said. “I thought Derek Carr was out of the pocket. I apologized to him on the field. Yeah, that was a play I wish I could take back.” The Baltimore secondary is missing Marcus Peters, out for the season with a knee injury. “That was huge. It kind of happened so fast, and we had to get on to Las Vegas,” Humphrey said. “His play of course, we missed him there, but the thing I’m going to miss most about him is the things he does when we’re not on the field — talking to me, talking to the guys, calming us down.” Cornerback Jimmy Smith (ankle) missed Monday’s game and was limited in practice Wednesday. Receiver Marquise Brown missed practice because of an ankle issue, although it’s unclear if that’s serious enough to put his status in any jeopardy for Sunday night’s game. He caught six passes for 69 yards and a touchdown in the opener. Mahomes is 11-0 as the starting quarterback in September, with 35 touchdown passes and no interceptions. And Kansas City can cause problems defensively too. “They’re going to be very aggressive, they’re going to try to create the illusion of chaos,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. “You’ve got to organize that and get it organized in your mind offensively and be ready to attack that.” NOTES: The Ravens promoted DB/LB Anthony Levine and DT Justin Ellis to the 53-man roster and signed T Andre Smith and CB Kevon Seymour to the practice squad.

But the science of the vaccine’s effectiveness will not be up for debate, one expert said. There is widespread agreement that the vaccines are primarily intended to reduce hospitalizations and deaths — which data shows they do well, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “What not everybody would agree to is the second thing, which I believe, that the point of vaccination is to also reduce the level of infection,” Wen said. That is the issue now being debated by officials and health experts, just as the average of new daily cases has shot up over the past two months. President Joe Biden and many experts say there’s a good reason for a third booster dose. And three reports published Wednesday support the argument that people may need a booster dose of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine over time, and suggest such boosters would be safe. The reports are part of a batch of data that will be discussed by the FDA’s vaccine advisers as it considers a request by Pfizer to approve a third, booster dose for most people six months after they get their first two doses of vaccine. But there isn’t unanimity right now. On Monday, a group of international vaccine experts, including some from the FDA and the World Health Organization, wrote in the Lancet that current evidence does not appear to support a need for booster shots in the general public right now. There also is fear that a focus on boosters will distract from the mission of getting a greater proportion of the public to get their initial doses. Only around 54% of the US population is fully vaccinated, which experts agree is the best form of protection against the virus. There is no clear answer yet on whether vaccine boosters are necessary, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Wednesday, but there is “a mountain” of data for experts to consider before making a decision. Friday’s discussion will be public, he added, so people can see the data that goes into the decision. Local health departments are planning on being ready to roll out booster doses next week if given the green light from the FDA, but many still have questions, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday. “What is the interval for boosters? Is it any shorter than eight months at this point? What is the age cut-off? Will there be priority groupings?” Freeman said. “We don’t want to be unprepared. We don’t want to appear uncoordinated on boosters.” Numb to tragedy As the pandemic continues to take a toll — Covid-19 has killed more than 666,000 people and infected 41.5 million in the US since January 2020 — the public is becoming numb to the tragedy, the former commissioner of the FDA Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Wednesday. “We are somewhat complacent with a very excessive amount of death and disease,” he said during an appearance at the SALT hedge fund conference in Manhattan. The US marked another grim milestone Wednesday: 1 in 500 Americans has died of Covid-19. It’s a number that can be hard to process, Wen said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Imagine if 1 in 500 Americans had died in a war due to a foreign adversary in the last year and a half. How would we be processing that information now? What would we be doing differently?” she asked. “Wouldn’t we be doing everything we can to end the war, end the suffering and deaths? “For us to not do everything we can with vaccines and masks in the meantime, it’s really unconscionable.” The increasing number of cases among young people is also alarming experts. In the first nine months of 2021, Covid-19 infections among children and adolescents in the Americas (including the US and Canada) reached over 1.9 million, according to Dr. Carissa Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization on Wednesday. That is more than 400,000 more than there were all of last year — before Covid-19 vaccines were available to young people over the age of 12. In the US, cases are likely to rise now that schools have reopened in the Northeast, Gottlieb said. “That’s going to build,” Gottlieb said, pointing to school outbreaks in other regions hit by the Delta variant. “The schools will become sources of spread in the Northeast as well.” However, Gottlieb, who sits on the board of Pfizer, doesn’t expect the Northeast to get hit nearly as hard as the South, mostly because of prior infections and high vaccination rates. Most Americans support Covid-19 restrictions Other strategies officials have promoted to increase virus protection are vaccine mandates and mask requirements. Last week, Biden announced a plan to tackle the pandemic, which included mandating businesses with more than 100 employees to require their workforce be either vaccinated or regularly tested. Many states and workplaces had already introduced similar measures. Los Angeles is set to expand vaccination requirements with the implementation of a new health order that will mandate vaccine verification for indoor bars, wineries, and nightclubs, and recommend the same for indoor restaurants, County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer announced Wednesday. There is support for Covid-19 vaccination requirements, but only in certain settings, according to a report released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center. About 61% of adults say proof of vaccination should be required to travel on an airplane, 57% say it should be required to attend public colleges or universities and 56% say it should be required to go to sporting events. When it comes to restaurants, Americans are split, with 50% saying proof should be required for people to eat inside. For stores and businesses, 54% oppose a vaccination requirement. And most Americans believe that the public health benefits of restrictions due to Covid-19 are worth the economic and lifestyle costs, the report said.

The actor and his wife are both performers on  Broadway  and they weren’t able to do what they love or provide for their family through their work on the stage because the pandemic shut down Broadway. Rivera is one of the many people interviewed about this time in a new documentary CBSN called “ Ghost Light: The Year Broadway Went Dark .” The documentary shines a light on how  Broadway’s workers kept hope alive when their entire industry went dark,  how they adjusted and how excited they are for the return of their shows. CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith spoke with Rivera about the biggest challenges he faced, his journey as Iago in the Broadway production of “Aladdin” and how he became a real estate agent during the pandemic. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Ghost Light: The Year Broadway Went Dark” streams on CBSN Thursday, September 16 at 9pm EST/PST. “Tuesday night was the reopening of The Lion King and I got to be in the audience,” said Rivera. “It was incredibly magical. The energy coming from New York City and the people sitting in the audience was incredible. I am just over the moon and thrilled for me, my friends and my family to bring theater back to the people and bring Broadway back to New York City.” Viewers of the documentary will be able to hear from actors, theater workers, composers and producers who were all impacted by Broadway being shut down. While Rivera was able to pivot to real estate and provide for his family in that way, the last year and a half has been one of the most difficult times in his life. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I’m the original Iago in Disney’s Aladdin, so I’ve been with the show since 2014 when we opened on Broadway,” said Rivera. “This show has been a part of my life for a long time and to not have it, my life here on the East Coast has literally only revolved around the show. When we shut down, it was devastating. I have a 5-year-old at home and my wife also works on Broadway and we weren’t used to putting our daughter to sleep at night. The babysitter would come and tuck her in on weeknights and weekend nights and all of the sudden we had these silver linings. The struggles were real. It was a really strange adjustment.” Rivera says he was initially counting the days he was not on stage and not performing. He changed his mindset and focused on the hope of returning to the stage one day. The actor will get the opportunity to do that when “Aladdin” reopens on Broadway later this month. “People want to see Broadway and we are so hungry to give it to them,” said Rivera. “That relationship of having audiences and being able to tell stories again, it made the hope 1000% real.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Download the CBS News app  and watch the documentary Thursday night at 9pm EST/PST on CBSN.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,330 new COVID-19 cases and 21 deaths, according to state health department data released Thursday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .08% to 4.46%. It’s the fourth day in a row that positivity decreased. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 15, to 804. Of those hospitalized, 593 remain in acute care and 211 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 515, 259 total confirmed cases and 10,011 deaths. To honor the  over 10,000 Marylanders  lost to COVID-19 Thursday, Governor Larry Hogan directed state flags at half staff. There are 3,823,325 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,755,678 doses. Of those, 3,891,558 are first doses with 5,250 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,526,419 second doses, 6,106 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 296,906 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 393 in the last day. The state reported 82.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15.

California is projected to take more arrivals than any other — more than 5,200 people, according to State Department data for the Afghan Placement and Assistance program obtained by The Associated Press. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Alabama and Mississippi are each slated to welcome 10, U.S. officials said Wednesday. Hawaii, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming and the District of Columbia are not expected to resettle anyone from the first group of evacuees who fled during the final days of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal last month. The administration has requested funding from Congress to help resettle 65,000 Afghans in the United States by the end of this month and 95,000 by September 2022. President Joe Biden tapped the former governor of his home state of Delaware, Jack Markell, to temporarily serve as his point person on resettling Afghan evacuees in the United States. States with a historically large number of Afghans who resettled in the U.S. over the last 20 years — including California, Maryland, Texas and Virginia — are again welcoming a disproportionate number of evacuees, according to the data. Many gravitate to northern Virginia, the Maryland suburbs of D.C. and northern California — some of the most expensive housing markets in the country. Oklahoma, which over the course of the 20-year war had resettled a relatively small number of Afghans, is slated to resettle 1,800 new arrivals. Many of the new evacuees requested to be resettled in those states because they already have family and close friends living in those states, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the calls to state government officials. Resettlement agencies also have a large presence and capacity in many of those states. The State Department resettled evacuees based on the advice of local affiliates of nine national resettlement agencies the U.S. government is working with, the officials said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The officials said Afghan evacuees are advised that other parts of the country — including areas with plentiful job openings and cheaper housing — could be good places to begin their new lives in the U.S. The Afghan evacuees go through a Department of Homeland Security-coordinated process of security vetting before being admitted. And every evacuee who comes into the United States also goes through health screening. Evacuees who are 12 and older are required to get the COVID-19 vaccination as a term of their humanitarian parolee status after entering the country. Still, there have been unexpected complications. U.S.-bound flights for evacuees who had been staying temporarily in third-country processing sites were halted last week after measles cases were discovered among several Afghans who had recently arrived in the U.S. Some of the recent Afghan arrivals could also face a tough road ahead if Congress doesn’t take action to treat them as refugees arriving in the U.S. The Afghan evacuees are not currently eligible for food stamps, cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program for low income families, Medicaid or other traditional refugee services that are funded through the Department of Health and Human Services. Currently, each Afghan evacuee is slated to receive $1,225 to help with rent, furniture and food and provide a small amount of pocket money. Biden has called on Congress to take action to ensure that the recent arrivals have access to the same benefits as refugees.

The Miami Dolphins are currently atop the division standings at 1-0, earning that spot with a 17-16 win over the Patriots in Mac Jones’ rookie debut. This week, all four teams in the division go head-to-head as the Jets host New England at MetLife Stadium and the Bills travel down to Miami to take on the Dolphins. Transition was the keyword for this group of teams all throughout the offseason, as the Jets and Patriots each start a rookie quarterback, the Dolphins roll with second-year signal caller Tua Tagovailoa, and the Bills look to make their first AFC East title defense since 1995. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts Week two figures to provide a good measuring stick for all four teams to see how each squad’s transition is going early on in 2021. CBS Boston sports director Steve Burton ran through both divisional matchups with CBS Local’s Katie Johnston ahead of week two. All times listed are Eastern. New England Patriots @ New York Jets, Sunday, September 19 @ 1:00 p.m. When the Jets and Patriots take to the field at MetLife Stadium this Sunday, it will be the two teams’ 125th matchup all time. The Patriots have gotten the better of the rivalry thus far, with 69 wins compared to the Jets’ 54, with one tie mixed in. This week two matchup will provide something the rivalry has never seen before, as both teams start rookie quarterbacks. For the Jets, Zach Wilson’s first game was a mixed bag. Wilson started just 6-16 for 84 yards with an interception in the first half of last week’s opener in Carolina. The second half was much better, as the offensive line started to give the BYU product time to operate, and he went 14-21 for 174 yards, two touchdowns and no turnovers after halftime. Another first-year Jet also contributed in a major way during the second half. Corey Davis was on the receiving end for both of Wilson’s touchdown throws. Defensively the Jets also found their footing in the second half against the Panthers. Carolina jumped out to an early 16-0 lead in the first half but was held to just three after halftime. With six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach Bill Belichick coming to town, Gang Green will need to get off to a faster start to come away with a victory. For New England, the Patriots lost two fumbles and were assessed over 80 yards in penalties against the Dolphins in week one. If Belichick and company are going to add one to the win column this week those issues cannot become a trend according to Burton. “There’s two things the Patriots have to go over this week — penalties and ball security,” Burton said. “One of the guys who fumbled the ball, Damien Harris, he’s been walking around all summer with a ball attached to his hand; so he knows better. Then there’s a rookie running back Rhamondre Stevenson who fumbled the ball as well. Turnovers killed the Patriots, they had four fumbles and two where they lost the football all together. Then there’s the penalties, they were penalized eight times for 84 yards. That is so unpatriotic when it comes to Bill Belichick teams.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University While there was plenty to dissect in week one, Burton did come away very impressed with the performance of rookie quarterback Mac Jones, saying, “You cannot blame this loss on Mac Jones, he went above and beyond, completed 74 percent of his passes. He was pretty much lights out and spot on for the most part.” As for his prediction heading into the game, Massachusetts’ own is sticking with his home town team. “I think it’s going to be all New England, because they had a little taste of humble pie,” Burton said. “The Patriots have a strong core, and they should be 1-0. It wasn’t that last week the Miami Dolphins beat the New England Patriots, the Patriots beat themselves. And so they know going into this week they can’t afford to let that happen in MetLife Stadium. It’s a business trip for them, they know what they have to do. They know they’re a better team than the New York Jets. And the Jets are coming off a loss as well.” Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Buffalo Bills @ Miami Dolphins, Sunday, September 19 @ 1:00 p.m. For the other half of the AFC East showdown this weekend, we look at reigning AFC East champion Buffalo Bills and the Miami Dolphins. At just 25-years-old, Josh Allen finds himself as the elder statesmen when it comes to quarterbacks in the East, with Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa the second oldest at 23-years-of-age. Miami is coming off a big win over the Patriots in week one that saw the Dolphins escape a nail-biter by forcing a fumble deep in their own territory to seal the game in the fourth quarter. Xavien Howard, a 2020 first-team All-Pro, was the one who ripped the ball out of Damien Harris’s hands to close out the contest. Miami’s bend-but-don’t-break defense was the story of the afternoon, as they allowed 393 yards of offense but only one touchdown. On offense the Dolphins accounted for just 276 yards but were able to punch the ball into the end zone twice; once via Tagovailos’ feet and once with his arm. The Bills offense also struggled to get things going last week as their only touchdown came on a pass from Josh Allen to Gabriel Davis in the second quarter. Despite going into halftime with a 10-0 lead, Buffalo elected to come out throwing rather than run and drain clock in the second half. Overall, Allen threw 51 times last weekend, with only 25 rushing attempts by the Bills as a team. The Bills defense wore down late in the game and allowed 17 fourth-quarter points, which made all the difference in a 23-16 final score. “Nobody was expecting that,” Burton said. “Josh Allen, quarterback of the Buffalo Bills just underperformed. Here’s a guy that everybody’s expecting big things from, he signed a huge contract. He’s probably one of the top quarterbacks in the national football league, and he laid an egg.” When it comes to this week’s contest, Burton has high hopes for a bounceback from Allen saying, “I don’t expect him to lay two eggs in a row.” Despite high expectations for Buffalo’s fourth-year QB Burton, expects a tight one in South Beach for week two.

The Denver Broncos used a steady performance from new quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to dispense with the New York Giants on the road. The Las Vegas Raiders topped the Baltimore Ravens in a thrilling overtime matchup to open their new stadium. The Los Angeles Chargers, under new coach Brandon Staley, looked impressive against the Washington Football Team’s top-rated defense. And the Kansas City Chiefs came back from 12 points down and then held off the Cleveland Browns to win. The West is the only undefeated division in the AFC. (The NFC West also opened with four wins.) With no matchups within the division this week, all four teams could continue their winning ways. But it won’t necessarily be easy. While the Broncos get a favorable matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars and rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Raiders, Chargers, and Chiefs don’t have it quite so easy. The Raiders travel to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers, who opened their season in impressive fashion. The Chargers host the Dallas Cowboys, looking to bounce back from a tough loss. And the Chiefs meet the Ravens, who are also hoping to put a heartbreaking Week 1 loss behind them. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts SportsLine ‘s  Larry Hartstein  breaks down AFC West matchups in Week 2. All times listed are Eastern. Denver Broncos @ Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, September 19, 1:00 p.m. (CBS) As the first overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft, Trevor Lawrence looked like the real deal. But the Jaguars are still far from a good team. They won one game last year, and struggled against the Houston Texans to open the season. While Lawrence had 332 passing yards and 3 touchdowns, he also missed plenty of receivers. The Broncos’ defense, however, is a giant step up from the Texans’. “It doesn’t shape up to be a great day for Trevor Lawrence, especially with what we saw against Houston,” Hartstein notes. “They were playing one of the worst defenses in all of football, and they were down 34-7. He threw three interceptions. He did get some points late to make it 37-21, a little bit more respectable. But now you go up against a defensive mastermind in Vic Fangio.” The Broncos defense kept the Giants on their heals all last Sunday. Saquon Barkley picked up just 26 yards on 10 carries in his return. Daniel Jones struggled to get the offense going. And the offense only managed just 13 points. Can the Jaguars do any better? “I think the Jaguars, with that offense, which doesn’t seem to be an NFL type of offense, with the pre-snap move motion, the formations, it’s not as complex as I think you need to be to be to beat Vic Fangio,” Hartstein believes. “So I think we’ll see big mistakes from Trevor Lawrence. I think we’ll see the Broncos play a very clean game, and I think they’ll get to 2-0. And I think they’ll cover the number.” Bridgewater, on the other hand, seems to be a step up for the Broncos at the QB position. He’s the QB the Broncos have been seeking since Peyton Manning retired. “He takes care of the ball,” says Hartstein, “22-3 against the spread on the road as a starting quarterback… does not make the big mistakes.” Las Vegas Raiders @ Pittsburgh Steelers, Sunday, September 19, 1:00 p.m. (CBS) The Raiders couldn’t have opened up their new stadium in more thrilling fashion. Derek Carr led three fourth-quarter drives to tie the game. Then, in overtime, he threw a 31-yard pass to Zay Jones for a touchdown and the win. Las Vegas now has to travel across the country to play the Raiders on a short week. “I just think how are you going to come down from that emotional high,” Hartstein wonders. “The Death Star in Vegas, the first time the fans were there. The excitement, the electricity, and they pull out that win in such thrilling fashion. And now you’ve got to travel east to play a very very good Pittsburgh defense, which showed up bigtime against Josh Allen and really frustrated what the Bills wanted to do.” The Steelers defense held Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills to just one touchdown. On offense, Ben Roethlisberger got things going in the second half after being held scoreless to open the game. But he still only threw for 188 yard on 18-32. Rookie Najee Harris out of Alabama averaged a lackluster 2.8 yards per carry on 18 carries and finished the game with 48 rushing yards. “The Raiders defense is not as bad as it’s been,” Hartstein points out. “Gus Bradley came in. There’s new talent. There’s [Yannick] Ngakoue, and Casey Hayward and the rookie Tre’von Moehrig. I thought they held up pretty well against the Ravens.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University All of this points to fewer points for both teams. “I’m going to look at the total here,” says Hartstein. “It’s already come down from 48 to 47. But I still lean under. I think the Raiders are going to have a little bit of problem getting going after that emotional win. And I think the Steelers offense, which we saw, is not so dynamic this year with 39-year-old — or however old he is — Big Ben. So I’m going to look under the total.” Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Dallas Cowboys @ Los Angeles Chargers, Sunday, September 19, 4:25 p.m. (CBS) The Cowboys came out firing in Week 1 and almost knocked off the defending Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The good news is that Dak Prescott seems to have mostly recovered. He threw for 403 yards and three touchdowns. The bad news is that the running game, behind Ezekiel Elliott didn’t do much of anything. Elliott picked up just 33 yards on 11 carries. The Cowboys defense remains a problem, and could get worse. Tom Brady threw for 379 yards and four touchdowns last week. And in practice this week, defensive end  DeMarcus Lawrence , the Cowboys’ best defender, broke his foot and will miss the next six to eight weeks. Fellow starting defensive end Randy Gregory tested positive for COVID and will also miss the game. “This is a real fascinating game,” says Hartstein. “The Cowboys offense looked amazing against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and they do have an extra rest to prepare. But Michael Gallup is out, and he’s one of their big weapons. You’re still going to see CeeDee Lamb and Zeke Elliott and Amari Cooper, of course, with Dak Prescott, put on a pretty good show.” The Chargers offense did enough to get the win. Justin Herbert, the NFL’s 2020 Rookie of the Year, went 31-47 for 337 yards and a touchdown. That includes converting 14 of 19 third downs, many of which were five yards or more, against a fierce pass rush. “I’m just impressed with Brandon Staley, this first year head coach, and what they were able to do in Washington,” says Hartstein. “I’m going to lean with the Chargers,” Harstein continues. “They’ve got the better defense. They’re at home. And I think Brandon Staley is turning this franchise around.” Kansas City Chiefs @ Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, September 19, 8:20 p.m. (NBC) The Chiefs opened their season with a tough win over the Browns, in what many predict could be a preview of the AFC Championship. Mahomes completed 27 of his 36 passes for 337 yards and three touchdowns, padding his already incredible career September stats. He’s 11-0 in the month, with 35 touchdowns and no interceptions. Mahomes will look to continue that trend against a Ravens team he’s owned in recent seasons. He’s 3-0 against Baltimore, with passer rating over 116. Kansas City’s win over Baltimore came without two of their three best defenders. “Tyrann Mathieu, the honey badger, he didn’t play,” Harstein notes. “Frank Clark, he didn’t play in Week 1. Both guys could be back. Mathieu is definitely going to play. That’s huge for the Chiefs.” The Ravens are coming off a difficult and draining loss to the Raiders, which could have implications for both teams, given the short week. According to Hartstein, “the Ravens are just so banged up, not just in the running back room but also on defense. That was an exhausting overtime game. Guys were limping. Marlon Humphrey stopped running on that last play. I don’t know if he just kind of gave up because he couldn’t catch the receiver. But that took a lot out of him, and he’s their best defender.” Baltimore, of course, still has Lamar Jackson, even if their running back situation isn’t what they would like. He ran for 86 yards in their opener. Kansas City, for their part, still struggles to stop the run. Look for another close game, though maybe not one where the Chiefs cover the spread. “The Chiefs have been winning close games, they haven’t been covering,” Hartstein notes. “You go back to their last 12 games, only 2-10 against the number. And the same thing happened in Week 1, where they were laying 5.5, laying 6 to the Browns. The Browns got there, losing only by four. But I think this spread, being as low as it is, being 3.5, being the Ravens on a short week, so banged up. And I think the Chiefs getting those key guys back on defense, two of their three best players on defense were not in the game in week one. I think that makes the difference, and the Chiefs do cover the number.” MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts Which picks can you make with confidence this week, and which Super Bowl contender goes down hard?

The Tender Bridge has seen an outpouring of support and wants to make sure these young men are never forgotten. “So many of the condolences start out with, ‘We’re sorry for your loss,’ but this loss belongs to the whole city.

(WJZ) —  The Anne Arundel County State’s Attorney released a statement in regards to the incident involving a  crossing guard  in Glen Burnie. Read the full statement below: READ MORE:  Impatient Driver Hits Crossing Guard With Vehicle In Glen Burnie, Police Say “After a thorough review of the video and multiple body worn camera footage from the scene, there is evidence that there may have been contact between the vehicle and crossing guard. Not only did the crossing guard react to it, but the officer at the scene observed it and heard the guard say that the driver had made contact with her. However, the video of the intersection helped us determine that the contact appears to be the result of the driver straightening his wheel and starting to reverse to back out of the crosswalk rather than the result of either a reckless or intentional act on his part. The driver had originally pulled into the crosswalk to move out of the way of a vehicle turning down the street where he was stopped waiting for traffic to clear. There is no indication that he failed to obey a traffic control device. Shortly after the apparent contact between the crossing guard and the driver, the officer witnessed them arguing about what had happened, and saw that the driver of the vehicle was angry and argumentative, which gave further indication that there had been unlawful physical contact.  READ MORE:  New Video Released Sheds Light After Police Say A Glen Burnie Man Intentionally Hit A School Crossing Guard Because there is ultimately no evidence that the driver was told to pull over or that he was otherwise put on notice that the crossing guard had suffered any bodily injury, there is insufficient evidence to prosecute any “hit and run” charge.  The officer presented the factual recitation that the vehicle struck the crossing guard to the district court commissioner who then determined what charges should be issued. Because the contact did not rise to the level of a criminal offense as an intentional or reckless act and there was no actual notice to the driver of any injuries at the time that legally required him to remain at the scene, the Office of the State’s Attorney has decided to enter all the charges Nolle Prosequi.”                                   ", "sentiment": 0.035658670033670035, "subjectivity": 0.44456770081770075, "wordcount": 385}

Cedric will hold down hosting duties this Sunday night on America’s Most Watched Network for the  73rd Primetime Emmy Awards  and then will be back on your TV, smartphone or tablet Monday night for the fourth season premiere of  The Neighborhood . CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to Cedric for the inside scoop on what to expect this Sunday night and what’s next for  The Neighborhood  on Monday. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW:  Cedric! Good to see you again especially with so much going on right now between hosting the  Emmy Awards  and the return of  The Neighborhood . You’re a very busy man, how’s it going for you over there? CTE:  It’s going great. I’m excited about it. It’s one of those things that it’s all happening right now. I’m doing finishing touches on my outfits. I’m doing the monologue. We’re doing skits. It’s all poppin’ off right now. MW:  I want to ask you about  The Neighborhood  first, what are you all bringing to the table for season four? CTE:  Of course, we’re just really happy to be back. But we’re going to do a lot of the same things. We’re going to touch on the socially conscience matters. At the same time we have this fun light sitcom. We’re planning to do a lot more of that. In the season opener Dave finds out he’s related to me which leads to a bunch of comedy off the top. But it also leads to a conversation about reparations. We do that kind of thing where we weave socially consciousness and social commentary into comedy and in this sitcom world. MW:  And part two with the Emmys coming up how did you prepare for your hosting duties? What went into that process? CTE:  Mainly it was working with the writing team and the producers and really trying to understand the format of the show. We started by doing some of the skits. The ideas I want to do. I had big ideas, due to COVID, we weren’t able to pull out some of them. I was going to interject myself into the Bridgertons. I really just wanted to wear some tights and a cool cape. Then do mix a smashup with  The Crown  and my show  The Neighborhood , but we couldn’t have access to each other sets. It made it a little difficult to do the ideas that I wanted to do. We figured out a way to do some other ones, so I’ll just let those be surprises. MW:  So you’re not wearing a cape is what you’re getting at? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn CTE:  [Laughs] I couldn’t pull it out. MW:  [Laughs] That’s disappointing. What are you looking forward to if it’s not donning a cape? CTE:  It’s going to be a night with great people in the house. I’m just looking forward to hopefully giving some of the awards. My partner Anthony Anderson is up for being on a TV show for 98 seconds. I’m like you talk about being a genius actor. It takes longer to microwave popcorn and this dude is nominated for a role he did in 98 seconds! That’s going to be good, man. That’s the kind of stuff, I’m just looking for these winners and people to come up have a great time. MW:  Last question here before I let you go. Bringing it back to  The Neighborhood , if you could sum up season four in three words, just three, how would you do it? CTE:  Oooh. Get. Ready. ToLaugh. To laugh is a compound word that I created. MW:  [Laughs] Like t-a apostrophe laugh. CTE:  Yeah, yeah. Ta’laugh. [laughs] MW:  For you, I think we can let that slide. You’ve earned that. CTE:  Right on. [Laughs] MW:  Thank you so much for the time Cedric, always a pleasure talking to you. All the best with the Neighborhood and with the Emmy’s! CTE:  Take care, appreciate you Matt!

(WJZ) —  The Maryland Wine Festival is returning this weekend to the Carroll County Farm Museum for its 37th annual celebration after last year’s event was canceled due to the pandemic. “One of the things that makes Maryland wines stand out as opposed to wines from other regions is we‘ve got 5 distinct growing regions in Maryland, the eastern shore, southern Maryland, western Maryland, central Maryland .. so we’ve got an incredible diversity of soil and climate,” said Kevin Atticks, Executive Director of Maryland Wineries Association. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Owners of Serpent Ridge Vineyard in Carroll County, Karen Smith and Hal Roche, said their red grapes are almost ready to be harvested to go into wine production and eventually bottled up to be enjoyed. “We are wine enthusiasts, that’s why we decided to make a career of it,” said Karen Smith, co-owner Serpent Ridge Vineyard. They’re just one of many who’ve taken advantage of the state’s rich soil, ideal for grape-growing. “I think people really enjoy the aspect of agritourism and visiting vineyards and learning more about grape growing and winemaking,” said Smith. “We benefit the state by bringing in a lot of visitors, it promotes other local businesses and restaurants and hotels.” The wine industry in Maryland has seen incredible growth, the Maryland Wineries Association said just 20 years ago there were only ten wineries. Today, there are over 100 wineries across the state. “What’s driving the growth is just the overall interest in growing and buying local, so folks travel the world and love wine and think well we can do that here,” said Atticks. This year, the Maryland Wine Festival will showcase 35 wineries across the state. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Every year is a new vintage, so we’ve got two vintages of wines to showcase and 35 wineries from around the state will be attending to pour dry wines, sweet wines, red wines, white wines, bubbly wines, all types of wines,” said Atticks. The event will also feature local vendors and live music. “It turns into a major tourism economic impact and that’s really one of the drivers of what makes Maryland wine so important to the state,” said Atticks. Whether you’re a wine connoisseur eager to pour a fresh glass or just dabbling into your first sip, there’s something for everyone. “You won’t know that unless you try it, you have to sample it,” said Roche. Tickets for the two-day Maryland Wine Festival are on sale online, you can also purchase them at the gate. For more details,  click here.

Almost automatically you say, “WOW that was fast!” But was it? Even though I said those exact words I am not sure. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured    Let me bring up a thought. One word, Cicadas. Remember them? Didn’t that seem like years ago? Yes, it does. Now given “that” I am not sure Summer zoomed along. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn   By our count, we had 8 heat waves. (Heatwave described as multiple days at or over 90°.) During each of those, I found myself, daily, looking forward to the next day and one day closer to the end of the extreme conditions. I think, over time, constantly looking ahead made the season seem to zoom by. Now back to that one word, Cicadas. That was back starting just after Preakness week. I guess in the end it is a matter of perspective, yours may be different than mine.   One final thought on this “Purple Friday.” Where did all the Cicadas little bodies, and shells, go? Other than some still sticking to downspouts and such, where are they.? At one point I had thousands around the base of a tree in my backyard. Not there anymore. Today Sean Streicher so gently said, “Well the lawnmower took care of that!” Nice. But I do not mow around the base of that tree. I guess over time, a long period of time, nature took care of that issue. And it did not happen overnight. Took a while. Summer was every bit of 90 days.

Philadelphia sports fans sometimes get a bad reputation, but CBS Philly’s Eyewitness News set out Thursday to find two fans from Wednesday night’s Phillies game whose heartwarming story is working to change that.   The touching moment from Wednesday night’s Phillies game that has the whole city buzzing.   A foul ball was hit down the third-base line where 10-year-old Aaron Pressley was sitting with his dad.   “I’m following the ball and I see it hit the ground, so I went to go grab it and it was just exciting,” Aaron said.   Aaron, a huge Philly sports fan, was celebrating his souvenir when he noticed the young girl sitting next to him.   “I look over and I see the girl, she’s crying,” he said.   That pint-size fan is 7-year-old Emma Brady.   “A guy, he catched the ball and I tried to get it, but he was too quick,” Emma said. “I cried because I fell on my leg.”   That’s when this happened.   “He came up to me and gave it to me,” Emma said.   Aaron handed the baseball to Emma.   “I was like it just didn’t feel right having the ball and knowing that somebody is crying so I had to just give it to her,” Aaron said.   Emma’s dad described the kind moment.   “He came right over without hesitation. He saw her for a moment and without even thinking, he just turned and handed her the ball. It was the sweetest thing,” Patrick Brady, Emma’s father said.   “She was just so polite, and she said thank you and we had to just take a picture together,” Aaron said.   Aaron may not have gone home with the game ball but says the experience taught him two lessons he hopes every Phillies fan will remember.   “Be nice to people because not a lot of people in this world are nice,” Aaron said.   And, just in case…   “I’ll probably remember to bring my glove this time,” Aaron said.   The Phillies found Aaron and gave him another baseball so he didn’t go home empty-handed.   Emma’s family also bought him a gift certificate to pick up some Phillies gear for his next night out at the park.

The CDC team used a medical record database to compare BMI changes in 432,302 US children between the ages of 2 and 19 before and during the pandemic. BMI is a measure that uses height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured All of the children in the study experienced significant increases in their rate of BMI change during the pandemic, except for children who were underweight, the report found. The increase was especially high in younger children and those with obesity. “Preschool and school-aged children, particularly those with obesity, had larger pandemic-associated increases in BMI than did adolescents,” wrote corresponding author Samantha Lange, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s population health and health care team. This may be due to closure of many child care centers and elementary schools during the pandemic, which reduced access to healthier food choices and organized exercise programs, according to the report. In children with obesity, the rate of change was 5.3 times higher during the pandemic, which could lead to significant weight gain, the report said. During the eight months of the study period, children with “moderate or severe obesity gained on average 1.0 and 1.2 pounds (0.45 and 0.54 kilograms) per month, respectively,” the CDC team wrote. “Weight gain at this rate over 6 months is estimated to result in 6.1 and 7.6 pounds (2.8 and 3.5 kilograms), respectively, compared with 2.7 pounds (1.2 kilograms) in a person with healthy weight.” The authors said the study is the “largest and first geographically diverse analysis” looking at the impact of the pandemic on BMI and the “first to show results by initial BMI category.” The findings, the study team noted, suggest a need for “increased access to efforts that promote healthy behaviors,” including BMI screening and coordinated federal and state efforts to “facilitate healthy eating and physical activity.” What families can do There are  evidence-backed ways  adults can help address their child’s pandemic weight gain (as well as their own). READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Get moving.  Going outdoors into the fresh air helps bodies of any age.  Sunlight helps with sleep , as does a  brisk walk , which is also good for your heart. Challenge your child — who can walk faster? (Psst — you have to let them win at times.) There are lots of organized family games and activities you can try — even if it’s merely drawing on the sidewalk for fun. Take a look at this  CNN list of 100 things you can do  with your kids (or not) to get some ideas. Pack your house with healthy foods.  Kids do what parents do,  so be a role model . Take your child grocery shopping and pick out healthy items. Limit the amount of processed foods you bring into the house. When you do serve them as snacks or treats, watch the portion sizes. Picky eaters and non-veggies lovers can be nudged toward eating vegetables by watching family members enjoy them, and by having a bit on their plate, night after night. The Mediterranean diet  wins awards each year  for its health benefits — lower risk of diabetes, heart disease, dementia and more. It’s also good for weight loss and includes  many options that appeal to kids , such as food on a stick and  veggie pizza (including this recipe for a pie with a cute face ). Turn off the screens, within reason.  It’s been hard to limit screen time during the pandemic. Even experts who call for limiting screen time get that. Parents are not allowing children to use electronic devices out of any “bad or malicious thought or neglect. They’re doing it because it’s an easy fix for a complex situation — which is a frustrated, hungry, tired child, and a frustrated, hungry, tired parent,” said Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson, a general pediatrician and chief of digital innovation at Seattle Children’s Hospital, in  a prior CNN interview . “I understand why you do it. I do it, too,” Swanson said. “But all of us have to work really hard to realize that it is a super easy solution and the harder way might be better and, in the end, might be more beneficial.” Here’s why it’s so important: In addition to weight gain and a lack of exercise, studies have shown excessive TV viewing is linked to the inability of children to pay  attention and think clearly , while increasing poor eating habits and  behavioral problems . Associations have also been shown between excessive screen time and  language delay,   poor sleep,   impaired executive function , and a decrease in parent-child engagement. The American Academy of Pediatrics has tools to  calculate your child’s media time  and then  establish a family media plan .

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,525 new COVID-19 cases and 12 deaths, according to state health department data released Friday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .01% to 4.45%. It’s the fifth day in a row that positivity decreased. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 12, to 792. Of those hospitalized, 593 remain in acute care and 211 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 516,784 total confirmed cases and 10,023 deaths. There are  3,828,936  Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,767,077 doses. Of those, 3,896,027 are first doses with 4,469 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out  3,531,706  second doses, 5,287 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 297,230 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 324 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 82.5% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

(Courtesy of Misty Baniewicz)   Baniewicz got the word out right away that the rabbit, who she calls “Marsh,” needed to be caught and treated fast because she learned that another rabbit was hit in the leg with a dart and did not survive. Neighbors Mariana and James Symecko grabbed their net and raced to help. “We dropped the net down on it like this, as carefully as we could,” James demonstrated, “I was able to go around and get control of the rabbit,” he said.

Now that the rabbit is in a secluded, more natural habitat, Dr. Gardner is planning more treatment and wants to keep his stress level down. Stress can cause some serious problems. “We want him to chill out, we want him to eat,” Dr. Gardner said. “We want him to take antibiotics for the next few days so those wounds can heal so we can get him out of here,” she said.   “Marsh” was taken to the South Florida Wildlife Center for treatment. (Courtesy of Misty Baniewicz)   The Symeckos said they hope to see Marsh soon. “I just hope that he comes back here, he has this beautiful green place that he lives, that he’s healthy and happy and we can come visit him a couple times,” Mariana Symecko said. If everything goes as planned, the South Florida Wildlife Center is hoping to release that rabbit next week in the neighborhood where he was found.

It will be easy,” said President Biden. However, the final decision on booster shots doesn’t rest with the White House but rather with an FDA advisory committee which is set to meet Friday to consider Pfizer’s application for third-dose authorization. This comes as medical journals are filled with differing opinions. UCSF’s Dr. Monica Gandhi says the messaging on potential boosters has muddied the waters.

In an article published in the British medical journal Lancet, scientists — including two outgoing FDA employees — argue that “currently available evidence does not show the need for widespread use of booster vaccinations.” Research from Israel released by the FDA shows waning immunity against severe disease may occur and that a booster significantly reduced the risk of severe illness.

The MVA said it is currently offering Commercial Driver’s Licenses at pre-pandemic levels, and it recently launched a function in the Central Scheduling System that allows customers to make same-day appointments by taking cancellations. “Throughout the pandemic, serving CDL holders, especially those in industries that are vital to the supply chain and state services, has been a top priority for us,” said MDOT MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer. “We will continue to work with our partners and local school districts to get their bus drivers, first responders and all other commercial drivers on the road safely and efficiently.” The MVA said school districts and bus drivers should email  schoolbus@mdot.maryland.gov  to schedule knowledge and skills testing in advance. Contact information including a  phone number, driver’s license number and a preferred time and location to assist with scheduling are requested in the email. The “Bus Driver’s Day at the MVA” locations can be found below.

( CBS Boston ) –  Sarah Kleinman’s regular Sunday hike in the Blue Hills certainly got her heart rate up. “I took a step and noticed right under me — probably a foot away — was the biggest snake I’d ever seen,” she tells WBZ-TV.   So the nurse midwife whipped out her cellphone and recorded the venomous, five-foot timber rattlesnake as it slithered across the trail. She was about half a mile from Chickatawbut Hill. “My first thought was that it must have escaped from the Franklin Park Zoo,” she says.   But when she shared her discovery with Mass Wildlife officials, she learned what many folks don’t know.  Timber rattlers  are native to all six New England states — but so rare these days they’re among the most endangered species in Massachusetts.   Five-foot timber rattlesnake spotted in Blue Hills Reservation (Image credit Sarah Kleinman)   In fact, after a century-and-a-half of decline, there are only a handful of pockets in the state where timber rattlers have been able to survive. And one of them is the 7,000-acre Blue Hills Reservation.   A pair of the snakes are even on display at the Blue Hills Trailside Museum — where they were rehabbed after suffering injuries in the wild. But the breed’s endangered status now makes it illegal to even disturb a timber rattler — much less catch or kill one.   “A lot of people seem to be really interested in this actually,” says Kleinman, who has been somewhat stunned by all the attention her sighting has received. “Mostly people who were just horrified that I even had this meeting with a snake. So I had a lot of validation for the fear I felt in the moment.”   It’s not widely known that two kinds of venomous snakes live here in Massachusetts — the other is the copperhead. While a bite from the rattler Kleinman encountered wouldn’t have been fatal, she’s still glad she didn’t step on it.   And as more and more people ask about her adventure, she’s been taking an informal poll. “Zero percent of the population likes snakes,” she tells WBZ.   Except for the experts at Mass Wildlife, who told her she was among the fortunate few in this region, who ever get to see a full-grown rattler up close. “I didn’t feel very lucky at first,” she says. “But now after a few days have passed — and because it’s such a unique sighting — I can embrace it a little bit more.”   In the figurative sense — of course.

The repeated attempts  to  rewrite the narrative  of the violence and panic of the day, and the persistent volatility around the politics of the 2020 election have made it impossible to predict what may happen this weekend. After all, l  aw enforcement was only expecting a free speech  protest the day Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Intelligence suggested that extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers would turn up, but some prominent members of the groups have sworn they aren’t going and have told others not to attend. Far-right online chatter has been generally tame, and Republican lawmakers are downplaying the event. But law enforcement officials are taking no chances. The  fence around the Capitol is  back up, temporarily at least. Police are preparing for the possibility that some demonstrators may arrive with weapons. Hundreds of counter-demonstrators are also expected with the possibility of clashes. The D.C. police department is activated, and U.S. Capitol Police have requested assistance from nearby law enforcement agencies. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved a request for about 100 members of the D.C. National Guard to be stationed at a city armory near the Capitol, to be called if needed as backup for other law enforcement agencies and primarily to protect the Capitol building and congressional offices. They’ll be without firearms, but will be equipped with batons and protective vests for self-defense. Police officials planned to lay out security plans Friday. Meanwhile, a Homeland Security intelligence report warned of social media posts that discussed possibly storming the Capitol the night before the rally. One user also “commented on kidnapping an identified member of Congress,” the document said, though the lawmaker wasn’t identified by name in the report. “Other references to violence identified on social media include discussions of using the rally to target local Jewish institutions, elected officials, and ‘liberal churches,'” it said. Many commenters on online platforms popular with the far right like Telegram disavowed the rally, saying they believed law enforcement was promoting the event to entrap Trump supporters. Some urged their followers not to attend what they said was a “false flag” event they believed was organized in secret by the FBI. At the same time, however, some commenters continued to promote rallies planned for Saturday in cities and state capitals across the country. In a notice to House members this week, Sergeant at Arms William Walker urged lawmakers to stay away from the Capitol complex on Saturday and reminded them of security available if they were traveling or had protests in their districts. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Lawmakers who supported Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat distanced themselves from the event. “I don’t know what it is,” said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said when asked about the rally. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said he would not be attending, though he said he does have questions about the treatment of those charged in the riot. His message to those coming to Washington for Saturday’s rally: “Obviously, if you do come here, peacefully protest. Make your point peacefully, that is every American citizen’s right.” Trump was still using his platform as the most popular leader in the GOP to express sympathy for those who were arrested and continue spreading the election misinformation and notched up his attacks by the end of the week. In a statement Thursday, he said: “Our hearts and minds are with the people being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election.” The Associated Press reviewed hundreds of court and jail records for the Capitol riot defendants to uncover how many were being detained and found about 60 held in federal custody awaiting trial or sentencing hearings. Federal officials are still looking for other suspects who could also wind up behind bars.  Just Friday, a judge ordered the pretrial detention of a Pennsylvania woman  who contends the court doesn’t have jurisdiction over her. At least 30 are jailed in Washington. The rest are locked up in facilities across the country. They have said they are being treated unfairly, and one defendant said he was beaten. Federal authorities have identified several of those detained as extremist group leaders, members or associates, including nine defendants linked to the Proud Boys and three connected to the antigovernment Oath Keepers. Dozens are charged with conspiring to mount coordinated attacks on the Capitol to block Congress from certifying the 2020 Electoral College vote, among the most serious of the charges. Some jailed defendants are charged with assaulting police officers, others will making violent threats. A few were freed after their arrests but subsequently detained again, accused of violating release conditions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has set standards for judges to apply in deciding whether to jail a Capitol riot defendant. A three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled in March that rioters accused of assaulting officers, breaking through windows, doors and barricades, or playing leadership roles in the attack were in “a different category of dangerousness” than those who merely cheered on the violence or entered the building after it was breached. Despite that, Trump and his allies have tried to shift the narrative on the violence of the day.  First, some blamed  attack on left-wing antifa antagonists, a theory quickly debunked. Then came comparisons of the rioters to peaceful protesters or even tourists. They’re now  saying the protesters are being treated unfairly  by the criminal justice system. Rally organizer,  Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign strategist,  has been promoting the Saturday event and others like it in cities nationwide to focus attention on what he calls the “political prisoners” being unfairly prosecuted.

Pfizer’s vaccine provided 88% protection against hospitalization, and Moderna’s was 93% effective. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led a nationwide study of vaccination involving more than 3,600 adults hospitalized for Covid-19 between March and August. “Among U.S. adults without immunocompromising conditions, vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization during March 11- August 15, 2021, was higher for the Moderna vaccine (93%) than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (88%) and the Janssen vaccine (71%),” the team wrote in the CDC’s weekly report on death and disease, the MMWR. “Although these real-world data suggest some variation in levels of protection by vaccine, all FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines provide substantial protection against COVID-19 hospitalization.” They found that the biggest difference between the vaccine made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNtech’s vaccine was driven by a decline that started about four months after people were fully vaccinated with Pfizer’s vaccine. “Differences in vaccine effectiveness between the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might be due to higher mRNA content in the Moderna vaccine, differences in timing between doses (3 weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech versus 4 weeks for Moderna), or possible differences between groups that received each vaccine that were not accounted for in the analysis,” the team wrote. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Vaccine effectiveness for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 91% at 14 -120 days after receipt of the second vaccine dose but declined significantly to 77% at more than 120 days,” the team wrote. Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines both use genetic material called messenger RNA to deliver immunity, but they use differing doses and slightly different formulations. The Janssen vaccine uses an inactivated common cold virus called adenovirus — a viral vector — to carry genetic instructions into the body. “A single dose of the Janssen viral vector vaccine had comparatively lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalizations,” the team said. “Understanding differences in vaccine effectiveness by vaccine product can guide individual choices and policy recommendations regarding vaccine boosters. All FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines provide substantial protection against COVID-19 hospitalization.” CDC worked with researchers across the country to study 3,689 patients at 21 hospitals in 18 states for the study. They also looked at antibodies in the blood of 100 healthy volunteers after they had been vaccinated with one of the three available vaccines. “These real-world data suggest that the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine regimens provide more protection than does the one-dose Janssen viral vector vaccine regimen. Although the Janssen vaccine had lower observed vaccine effectiveness, one dose of Janssen vaccine still reduced risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization by 71%,” they wrote. The study had limitations. “This analysis did not consider children, immunocompromised adults, or vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 that did not result in hospitalization,” the team wrote. Plus, the volunteers were only followed for 29 weeks — just over six months.

More people are living to 100, especially in the U.S. So it got us wondering, what is the key to a long life? WCCO-TV in Minneapolis went straight to the source to answer that Good Question.   Doraine Bingham will be 102 on Nov. 3. Diana Koelling turned 100 on June 20. They live in Presbyterian Homes of Bloomington in Minnesota, where just next week 10 more residents will celebrate being 100-plus.   Bingham and Koelling have quite the stories to tell, because their life stories span more than a century. Koelling says she never imagined she would live to 100. But she’s tough. She lost her husband at 28 and went to work while proudly raising her three kids.   “I was very active all my life, I golfed and swam,” she said.   Bingham raised four kids and worked in a blood lab at the Mayo Clinic. She is active, too, taking up tap dancing in her 60s. “The main thing is to keep active,” she said. “Once you start staying in your apartment, you kinda turn it off.”   Their neighbor Ken Hanson, a World War II vet, stays active, too. He’s a skilled artist and cook. He turns 101 next week. “Why not be optimistic about it?” he said. “I hardly ever think about death. I got too many things I want to do.”   Dr. Kathleen Woo-Rippe heads up the geriatrics population program for Allina. “When I see the people who are over 100, they all have something in common, and that is they’re pretty feisty,” Woo-Rippe said.   The population she serves is growing. The U.S. has more people over 100 than any other country — 97,000.   Woo-Rippe says there are a few reasons people are living longer. “Number one is their attitude, they enjoy life,’ she said.   She believes another huge reason, like Koelling and Bingham suggested, is physical activity. “We hear it all the time, exercise is good for you but it really is,” she said. “Not only physically is it good for you, but it’s also good for your brain.”   She says it’s also key to keep learning new things and to stay social with friends and family.   As for the “good genes” theory? “There is a portion of the longevity that comes from genes, but it’s about 20, 25%,” Woo-Rippe said. “The rest of it is how you live your life.”   And clearly these centurions we talked with have life figured out. “I’m not ready yet, I’m not ready to go upstairs,” Hanson said.   The geriatrician we spoke with says others reasons people are living longer are because of advancements in medicine and because they are eating fresher, less processed food.

Second-year quarterback Justin Herbert handled a difficult Washington Football Team defense last week to turn in the team’s first win. (They’ll visit the Philadelphia Eagles and host the New York Giants later in the season.) Their first home game of the season will also be their first ever game at the new SoFi Stadium. The Cowboys are coming off a strong showing that ended in disappointment and seemed to pose as many questions as it answered. Dallas lost, 31-29, to the Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a game they easily could have won. And while returning quarterback Dak Prescott played like his pre-injury self, Ezekiel Elliott was a nonfactor and the Cowboys defense continued to be a weakness. READ MORE:  Fantasy Football Start Or Sit Week 2: Is Aaron Rodgers Due For A Big Bounceback Game? Prescott seems to have sufficiently recovered from the ankle injury that ended his season last year and the shoulder issues that limited his training camp and preseason. He lit up the Bucs defense, not one of the better pass defenses in the league, to the tune of 42 completions for 403 yards and three touchdowns. The 42 completions matched a  career high . Amari Cooper and CeeDee Lamb accounted for about half of that, piling up 20 catches for 243 yards and three TDs between them. “I don’t think they want him (Prescott) to have to do that week in and week out,” said NFL On CBS reporter Evan Washburn about Prescott’s performance. “They have an All Pro-caliber running back that they pay a lot of money to in Ezekiel Elliott that was not a big impact player in that Week 1 game. I think that was more the nature of what that game became. But, Dallas, with Mike McCarthy running things, and the way that offense is structured, the running game has to be a priority. The way that they achieve balance is going to dictate a lot of how well this team plays this season offensively. So I think what Dak showed everyone — most importantly, the people in that organization — is that he’s healthy. He can throw it, the shoulder didn’t seem to be a problem. And he can move around and make athletic plays despite what was a pretty horrific ankle injury. So those are good signs. They need to be able to run the ball better to be an impact team this season.” Elliott only carried the ball 11 times for 33 yards. And while the Bucs are stout defenders against the run, the Cowboys will need more production out of him to be successful. That will be tough given the lack of continuity along Dallas’s offensive line. Right tackle  La’el Collins  was suspended for five games after the opener for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. On the bright side, right guard  Zack Martin  will return after a week on the COVID list. But the team’s top three offensive linemen — Collins, Martin, and left tackle Tyron Smith — won’t play together until at least late October. Backup lineman  Ty Nsekhe  spent Thursday night in the hospital with a heat-related illness and will also miss Sunday’s game. The unit may have its hands full with a Chargers defense that includes outside linebacker Joey Bosa. “As talented as some of those tackles are — Tyron Smith and company — Joey Bosa can wreck a game at times,” said Washburn. “So if that means putting a tight end in at times to chip him or a running back hanging in for some extra protection to give Dak that extra second, I think that those are all things you can employ to deal with a premier edge rusher like Joey Bosa. But I also I do feel like there’s talent at that tackle position, at least on one side, to be able to manage that one-on-one matchup over the course of the game.” The Chargers defense limited a so-so  Washington offense  that played much of Week 1 behind backup QB Taylor Heinicke. Part of that success comes from a Brandon Staley scheme that provides different looks. The Los Angeles Rams defense, which he led last season, would rotate out of what seemed like a pass defense to stop the run. Still, WFT running back Antonio Gibson piled up 90 yards on the ground. The Prescott-led Cowboys, should they opt for a more balanced attack this week, could be a stiffer test. READ MORE:  SportsLine Week 2 AFC West Picks: ‘We’ll See The Broncos Play A Very Clean Game,’ Says SportsLine’s Larry Hartstein There’s some talent on this Chargers unit, aside from Bosa. Safety Derwin James, a 2019 Pro Bowl selection, has returned to the secondary after missing all of last season. Linebacker Uchenna Nwosu takes over for Melvin Ingram, who signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers this past offseason. And Michael Davis takes over the top corner spot. The Chargers offense is generating a lot of excitement behind last season’s Offensive Rookie of the Year, Justin Herbert. He finished last season sixth in passing yards, with 4,336 and 10th in touchdown passes with 31. And given his 337-yard outing in Week 1 (that featured plenty of receiver drops), he’s on his way to another strong season. Keenan Allen, his favorite target, caught 100 passes for 992 yards and eight TDs in 2020. Their number two wide receiver, Mike Williams, is also dangerous. The pair combined for 17 catches and 182 yards against the WFT last week. Austin Ekeler is elusive out of the backfield and heavily involved in the passing game as well. It remains to be seen if this much-maligned Cowboys defense can slow Herbert and company. Tom Brady torched them for 379 yards and four touchdowns in Week 1. “This is a defense that’s trying to rebound from a couple of challenging seasons,” Washburn noted. “And look, they were tested out of the gate with arguably the best team in the NFL right now in the Tampa Bay Bucs. And they were able to make some plays, and you saw some flashes, despite the eventual score and yardage output that was pretty eye-opening. But I think that’s just a product of the new NFL. I think there’s enough talent defensively for Dallas to be a solid enough defense to work with what could be an explosive offense, and that should continue against L.A. on Sunday.” They’ll have to live up to that potential without defensive end  DeMarcus Lawrence . He broke his foot in practice this week and will be out for six to eight weeks. Fellow starting defensive end Randy Gregory will also likely miss the game after testing positive for COVID. The Cowboys have no quarterback sacks so far this season and may struggle to get to Herbert this week. Dallas’s secondary is also suspect, a problem that carries over from last season. And a lack of pass rush will expose it further. Trevon Diggs is a solid enough corner on one side, but Anthony Brown and slot corner Jourdan Lewis can be attacked for nice gains.

The twin votes represented a heavy blow to the Biden administration’s sweeping effort to shore up nearly all Americans’ protection amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The decision was made by a committee of outside experts who advise the Food and Drug Administration. In a surprising turn, the panel first rejected, by a vote of 16-2, boosters for nearly everyone. Members cited a lack of safety data on extra doses and also raised doubts about the value of mass boosters, rather than ones targeted to specific groups. Then, in an 18-0 vote, it endorsed the extra shot for select portions of the U.S. population — namely, those most at risk from the virus. That would help salvage part of the White House’s campaign but would still be a huge step back from the huge plan proposed by administration a month ago to offer booster shots of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to nearly all Americans eight months after they get their second dose. Friday’s vote was just the first step. The FDA itself is expected to make a decision on boosters in the next few days, though it usually follows the committee’s recommendations. The offering of boosters is also subject to approval by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A CDC advisory panel is expected to take up the question on Wednesday. The CDC has said it is considering boosters for older people, nursing home residents and front-line health care workers, rather than all adults. Separate FDA and CDC decisions will be needed in order for people who received the Moderna or J&J shots to get boosters. During several hours of vigorous debate Friday, members of the panel questioned the value of offering boosters to nearly everyone. “I don’t think a booster dose is going to significantly contribute to controlling the pandemic,” said Dr. Cody Meissner of Tufts University. “And I think it’s important that the main message we transmit is that we’ve got to get everyone two doses.” Dr. Amanda Cohn of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: “At this moment it is clear that the unvaccinated are driving transmission in the United States.” Scientists inside and outside the government have been divided in recent days over the need for boosters and who should get them, and the World Health Organization has strongly objected to rich nations giving a third round of shots when poor countries don’t have enough vaccine for their first. While research suggests immunity levels in those who have been vaccinated wane over time and boosters can reverse that, the Pfizer vaccine is still highly protective against severe illness and death, even amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. The surprise turn of events could reinforce recent criticism that the Biden administration got out ahead of the science in its push for boosters. President Joe Biden promised early on that his administration would “follow the science,” following disclosures of political meddling in the Trump administration’s coronavirus response. The FDA panel’s overwhelming rejection came despite full-throated arguments about the need for boosters from both Pfizer and health officials from Israel, which began offering boosters to its citizens in July. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Sharon Alroy-Preis of Israel’s Ministry of Health said the booster dose improves protection tenfold against infection in people 60 and older. “It’s like a fresh vaccine,” bringing protection back to original levels and helping Israel “dampen severe cases in the fourth wave,” she said. And representatives for Pfizer argued that it is important to shore up immunity before protection against severe disease starts to erode. A company study of 44,000 people showed effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was 96% two months after the second dose, but had dropped to 84% by around six months. Both Pfizer and the Israeli representatives faced pushback from panelists. Several expressed skepticism about the relevance of Israel’s experience to the U.S. Another concern was whether third doses would exacerbate serious side effects. Meissner said he is worried about extra doses for younger age groups given the risk of heart inflammation that has been seen in mostly younger men after a second dose. While the condition is very rare, he said, it is not clear if that risk would increase with another dose. Pfizer pointed to Israeli data from nearly 3 million boosters to suggest side effect rates would be similar to that seen after second doses. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he was more likely to support approving a third dose for adults over 60 or 65 but “I really have trouble” supporting it for anyone down to age 16. While an extra shot likely will at least temporarily decrease cases with mild or no symptoms, “the question becomes what will be the impact of that on the arc of the pandemic, which may not be all that much,” Offit said. Biden’s top health advisers, including the heads of the FDA and CDC, first announced plans for widespread booster shots a month ago, targeting the week of Sept. 20 as an all-but-certain start date. But that was before FDA staff scientists had completed their own assessments of the data. Earlier this week, two top FDA vaccine reviewers joined a group of international scientists in publishing an editorial rejecting the need for boosters in healthy people. The scientists said continuing studies show the shots are working well despite the delta variant. On Friday, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said that in announcing its booster plan, the Biden administration was not trying to pressure regulators to act but was instead trying to be transparent with the public and be prepared in the event that extra shots won approval. “We have always said that this initial plan would be contingent on the FDA and the CDC’s independent evaluation,” Murthy said. The Biden plan has also raised major ethical concerns about impoverished parts of the world still clamoring for vaccine. But the administration has argued that the plan is not an us-or-them choice, noting that the U.S. is supplying large quantities of vaccine to the rest of the globe. The U.S. has already approved Pfizer and Moderna boosters for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and transplant recipients. Some Americans, healthy or not, have managed to get boosters, in some cases simply by showing up and asking for a shot. And some health systems already are offering extra doses to high-risk people.

The boys’ aunt told investigators someone contacted her nephews and asked them to mail dirty socks. During the same time period, Cummings had several social media accounts under several names and using false female personas to pretend he was a young girl communicating with the boys, who were between 13 and 16, according to the statement. Cummings asked them to send pictures and videos of themselves in explicit sexual conduct and told authorities he distributed some of the photos he received. Cummings, posing as a teenage girl, also sends explicit pictures of a teen girl to at least five of the boys, according to the statement.

If the boys declined to comply with Cummings’ demands, he threatened to post their names and addresses and distribute their videos to their teachers and school or post them on social media. He proceeded to do so at least once, according to the statement. When authorities executed a search warrant on July 19, 2019, they seized his cell phone that contained images of child pornography, including of the victims, the aliases for the fake social media accounts. Cummings told police the demand for the dirty socks stemmed from a fetish.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 4, to 788. Of those hospitalized, 586 remain in acute care and 206 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 518,061 total confirmed cases and 10,035 deaths. There are  3,835,130  Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,779,952 doses. Of those, 3,901,097 are first doses with 5,070 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out  3,537,592  second doses, 5,886 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured And it’s the sixth day that it’s decreased. The vaccination effort continued Saturday across the state including in one of its zip codes hit hardest by COVID, 21215. Saturday, the New Psalmist Baptist Church worked with the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital to offer more shots of the vaccine for kids who are going back to school so that more of this community is protected against the virus. Dozens lined up for shots of the COVID-19 vaccine at this event. “It is critical that we do vaccinations. That we get the vaccine in person’s bodies,” said Bishop Walter Thomas, the church’s pastor. More than 5,600 people in the 21215 zip code have been diagnosed with COVID-19. The goal here was to get more people in the community vaccinated with the help of trusted church leaders. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It feels a lot more comfortable to receive the vaccination knowing that people you already know and trust are right at your side supporting you through it so we really have appreciated this collaboration,” said Dr. Rebecca Carter, director of community outreach and engagement at the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital. Thomas said he worked with the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital to host the event because he wants to get as many people vaccinated as quickly possible. “The only way we’re going to get back to some semblance of life and build upon it for the future is to stop this virus in its tracks,” he said. The state health department reports that almost 48 percent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated against covid-19 in 21215, meaning more than half the people in it don’t have the extra layer of protection the vaccine offers. Thomas says the only way to safely protect against the virus is with the vaccine. “It won’t stop with rhetoric it won’t stop with arguments. It will only stop with a vaccination,” he said. And as of Saturday, almost 58 percent of people eligible for the vaccine in Baltimore have been fully vaccinated.

Martinez had a solo homer and Kevin Plawecki added a two-run single for the Red Sox. “When it’s getting down to the end of the year and you don’t have a big lead and all the games matter, it gets to be a lot of fun,” Hernández said. Trey Mancini had a three-run double for the Orioles, who lost 12 of the final 13 meetings against the Red Sox after sweeping a season-opening three-game series. After giving up a two-run lead in the top of the seventh, Boston rallied against Conner Greene (1-1), getting the tying hit when Hernández’s grounder bounced off the bag, scoring José Iglesias. “That’s exactly what I was trying to do. That’s how I drew it up,” Hernández said, smiling. “I was a little bit happy to get that hit and drive in that run.” Hunter Renfroe followed with a double high off the Green Monster and scored on Rafael Devers’ single, making it 8-6. “We got a little bit lucky with the ball off the bag,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “Then Hunter put on a huge swing. … Overall, another good win, obviously.” The victory could be costly for the Red Sox after reliever Garrett Whitlock walked off the mound with right pectoral tightness. The 25-year-old Whitlock, a Rule 5 pickup from the Yankees, has been a strong part of their bullpen this season. “We’ll know more (Monday),” Cora said of Whitlock. “It’s too soon to know what’s going on.” Hirokazu Sawamura (5-1) was credited with the victory despite giving up a two-run lead in the seventh. Garrett Richards got the final three outs for his third save. The Red Sox had jumped on starter Alexander Wells for three runs with two outs in the first when Bobby Dalbec got hit by a pitch with the bases loaded and Plawecki followed with his grounder to right. They opened it to 5-3 on Martinez’s shot into the first row of Monster seats in the third. But the Orioles rallied against Sawamura after Whitlock walked the leadoff batter, scoring three runs on Mancini’s double down the left-field line before they lost their major league-high 102nd game. “This is huge, a huge amount of our team hasn’t played a lot of time in the majors,” Mancini said. “The teams we’re competing with the rest of the way, and have been basically the whole month, are fighting for a playoff spot.” Boston starter Nathan Eovaldi struck out eight over five innings, allowing three runs on seven hits with one walk. The Red Sox have won his last six starts. “The main focus is we’re winning these games,” Eovaldi said. “Things will even out (for me).” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Making his sixth major league start, the 24-year-old Wells gave up five runs in five innings. “He gave four there in the first couple of innings,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “It was nice to see him put up a zero in the fourth and fifth. I was really happy with our offense.” KEEP THE KID IN When asked why left-handed hitting slugger Kyle Schwarber wasn’t in the lineup, Cora didn’t hesitate to explain the decision. “This is more about Bobby Dalbec than anything else,” he said. “Bobby has to play against every lefty.” The 26-year-old Dalbec, a right-handed hitter, has 12 homers and 36 RBIs in his last 33 games, overcoming early-season struggles that saw him hitting only .174 with one homer and six RBIs a month into the season. CHASING O’S HISTORY CF Cedric Mullins needs one more home run to become the first in Orioles’ history with 30 homers and 30 stolen bases. IT FEELS RIGHT It was the fifth straight game that the Red Sox faced a left-handed starter, and they’ve scored seven or more runs in all of those games. TRAINER’S ROOM Orioles: INF Ramon Urías was scratched from the original starting lineup with a right leg injury that’s been nagging him for about a month. “He tried to run this morning, just didn’t feel great,” Hyde said. … Mancini and C Pedro Severino were back in the lineup after having Saturday off. Red Sox: Cora gave catcher Christian Vázquez the day off, figuring with an offday on Monday that two straight would be good for him. UP NEXT Orioles: LHP John Means (5-7, 3.41 ERA) is slated to go Monday night when they open a three-game, interleague series at the Phillies. Red Sox: Off Monday before opening a two-game, interleague series against the New York Mets at Fenway Park on Tuesday. Red Sox LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (11-8, 5.00) is in line to start the opener against RHP Marcus Stroman (9-12, 2.88).

(WJZ) —  Officials announced that 36-year-old Eric Eoin Marques was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release for conspiracy to advertise child pornography on the dark web. According to authorities, millions of images of child exploitation material were found and removed from the hosting server. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Eric Marques was one of the largest facilitators of child pornography in the world,” said Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner. “This is an egregious case where one individual facilitated the abuse of more than a million new child victims and attempted to keep the abuse hidden on the dark web. We are grateful to our law enforcement partners here and abroad for helping us to bring Eric Marques to justice. We will continue to do everything we can to find and prosecute those who use the anonymity of the Internet to perpetuate the cruel and heartless business of the sexual abuse of children for personal gain, in order to keep our children safe.” Marques of Dublin, Ireland is a dual national citizen of the US. He pleaded guilty on Feb. 6, 2020, after being extradited by Irish authorities. Marques arrived in the US on March 23, 2019, to face federal charges filed in Maryland on Aug. 8, 2013. According to his plea agreement, from July 24, 2008, until July 29, 2013, Marques conspired to advertise child pornography by operating a free, anonymous web hosting server on the dark web —  only accessible by means of special software which allows users and website operators to remain anonymous or untraceable. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Officials said the defendant’s hosting service hosted websites that allowed users to view and share images documenting the sexual abuse of children, including the abuse of prepubescent minors, violent sexual abuse, and bestiality. Further investigation revealed that the hosting service contained over 200 child exploitation websites that contained millions of images of child exploitation material. More than 1.97 million of these images and videos involved victims that were not previously known by law enforcement. Officials said many of the images involved sadistic abuse of infants and toddlers to include bondage, bestiality and humiliation to include urination, defecation and vomit. Marques admitted that this offense also involved the distribution of child pornography, which involved minors who were less than twelve years old including infants and toddlers and sadistic or masochistic material or depictions of violence.

Thirty-seven-year-old Demar Brown of Paterson, NJ and Winston-Salem, NC, 37-year-old Jahson Fields of Atlanta and 35-year-old Kamar Beckles of Teaneck, NJ, were all convicted following a 10-day trial. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured According to authorities, the trio broke into at least 20 residences in Baltimore County and Georgia and stole at least $850,000 worth of property. According to evidence, from Nov. 29, 2017 through Jan. 26, 2018, the defendants comitted a series of break-ins in order to steal property, including cash, foreign currency, safes, jewelry, designer purses and clothing, personal electronics, collectibles, personal identity documents, and items of sentimental value. Authorities said the defendants planned to sell the stolen property out-of-state for cash. Witnesses stated that the defendant wore masks and gloves during the break-ins and communicated with each other using two-way radios and cell phones. One of them would usually remain in the getaway car. Officials said the trio would also rent hotel rooms in Maryland to store the stolen goods until they were transported out of state. Brown and Beckles took the property to two residences in Winston-Salem that Brown had access to. The defendants were arrested on Jan. 26, 2018, near two residences that were recently burglarized.  Brown was arrested after officers responding to the burglary noticed a dark green Ford Explorer with North Carolina tags traveling slowly down the street. The car was identical to a vehicle seen in the surveillance video from some of the previous burglaries. 7 After a short vehicle chase, Brown was eventually arrested after trying to flee from the SUV. Beckles and Fields were arrested after being found in a nearby wooded area — about a half-mile from one of the burglarized homes. Officials said at the time of his arrest, Beckles was wearing a distinct jacket with a reflective emblem on the back that was identical to the insignia visible in surveillance video from some of the previous burglaries.

Brown also had a breakfast ticket from the hotel matching the key card where law enforcement learned Beckles had rented two rooms in his name. A search warrant for the rented rooms was executed and the second search of one of the rooms occurred a few of days later. During the search, officials recovered jewelry stolen from a residence on Jan. 25, 2018, property from homes burglarized in Milton, Georgia on Jan. 24, and property from homes burglarized in Baltimore County on Dec. 28, 2017, Dec. 29, 2017, Jan. 9, 2018 and Jan. 10, 2018. A mask, a pair of gloves, a diamond tester, a scale and a gold testing kit were also recovered. In the second room, they found Fields’ license, mail in the name of Beckles and various phones among other things. On Jan. 27, 2018, officials executed a search warrant on the Ford Explorer driven by Brown the previous day. There, they found various tools and clothing for use in connection with burglaries, including a pry bar, a drill and hole saw, a mallet, three chisels, a reciprocating saw, multiple pairs of gloves, black knit hats, a balaclava style mask, two-way radios and flashlights, among other things. Officials also found many of the pieces of stolen property during two burglaries the previous day, as well as notes concerning a pawn shop and a jewelry shop in North Carolina. On Jan. 30, 2018, law enforcement obtained search and seizure warrants for Brown’s residences in Winston-Salem. There they found property from three burglaries in Baltimore County including numerous pieces of fine jewelry. Evidence on the nine phones seized from the defendants, the SUV, and the defendants’ hotel rooms showed, among other things, Brown and Beckles photographing many pieces of the jewelry and other items taken during some of the burglaries. Only some of that stolen property has been recovered and returned to its owners. However, for a few victims, the vast majority of their property has yet to be recovered.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,036 new COVID-19 cases but no new deaths, according to state health department data released Sunday morning. The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .011% to 4.34%. It’s the first time in six days that the positivity rate increased. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 19, to 807. Of those hospitalized, 599 remain in acute care and 208 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 519,097 total confirmed cases and 10,035 deaths. There are  3,840,482  Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,790,403 doses. Of those, 3,905,156 are first doses with 4,059 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out  3,542,758  second doses, 5,166 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 297,724 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 186 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 82.8% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured On Sunday, no new deaths were reported in the last 24 hours in Maryland but the number of people in the hospital remains up. The positivity hit 4.34 percent overnight as more than 1000 people tested positive since Saturday. But one question about school-aged children still remains on the minds of many parents and educators — are children safe in schools? “The most significant and severe parts of this disease where it becomes fatal is not affecting children how it affects adults,” said Beth Blauer, Public Sector Innovation, Johns Hopkins. The Coronavirus Resource Center believes children are still in the lowest susceptible age group to COVID-19. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It’s still unclear whether the Delta variant causes more severe disease in children,” said Dr. William Moss with the International Vaccine Access Center. But as many are unprotected by the vaccine, many schools across the country have implemented a mask mandate. Some, like Dallas, are breaking state rulings to do so. “It’s not COVID 1.0 now we have 363 students and 259 staff,” said Dr. Michael Hinojosa, Superintendent, Dallas Independent Schools. Dr. Moss from the International Vaccine Access Center said the FDA is requiring six months of testing for ages under 12. The adult vaccine testing period was two months. He thinks ages five to 11 could be approved for the Pfizer vaccine as early as late October and ages two to five may be approved by early 2022.

(WJZ) —  If you live in Ellicott City, good news! It’s ranked the best place to live in Maryland scoring the 10th spot on Money Magazine’s “Best Places To Live” list. This year’s rankings were out of 1,300 US cities. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “There is not any place in America that comes close to the heart and the vibe and the community feel of Ellicott City,” said Pam Long, Ellicott City Board of Directors and owner of Pam Long Photography. A diverse and quirky town that’s brimming with history. “To me, it feels like a Hallmark town, like everyone knows everyone,” said Teresa Graham, Owner of Flower Barn. Money Magazine recently ranked the town number 10 on its “Best Places To Live” list — looking at several factors such as economic opportunities, housing and cost of living and health and safety. “This honor reflects the resilience, the focus, the dedication and the stick to it-iveness of Ellicott City residents and businesses,” said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball. Home to a number of eclectic shops, art galleries, restaurants and more, the city boasts anything from ordinary. “I love the people. I mean I’m all about Ellicott City,” said Graham. It’s the captivating culture that attracts people to the area. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Getting to know the business owners. Getting to know the people, that’s really what makes this town and it’s the building foundation of the community,” said Chris Pineda, Executive Director of Ellicott City partnership. A community no stranger to hardship like its devastating flooding still rises above — through thick and thin. “We were tight before the first flood. I definitely think the experience of mucking together and getting everything together, brought us closer together. But really I think there’s no weather event stronger than the people here in town,” said Long. And it’s not just historic Ellicott City that has its charm. “We have the route 40 corridor, which has so much diversity. It is one of the places that has the highest concentration of Korean businesses and restaurants,” said Ball. Whether you decide to pass through for a visit or stay for good, it’s a title that residents and business owners are proud of and hope to keep for years to come. “We’re going to do whatever we can to keep this town on the map and keep moving forward,” said Long. Money Magazine also cited Ellicott City’s hot housing market — which is up five percent in the first quarter of the year and projected 13-percent job growth by 2025.

In addition to its top drama award, “The Crown” collected lead acting honors for Olivia Colman and Josh O’Connor and supporting prizes for Gillian Anderson and Tobias Menzies. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Ted Lasso” earned a lead-actor Emmy for co-creator Jason Sudeikis and supporting honors for Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein. Netflix’s “The Queen’s Gambit” scored the Emmy for outstanding limited/anthology series or movie, while also winning a prize for director Scott Frank. HBO’s “Mare of Easttown,” however, also had a big night at the Emmys, winning a best-actress prize for star Kate Winslet and supporting- performer honors for Evan Peters and Julianne Nicholson. “`Mare of Easttown’ was this cultural moment, and it brought people together and gave them something to talk about other than a global pandemic,” Winslet said. Ewan McGregor won the Emmy for best actor in a limited/anthology series or movie for Netflix’s “Halston” — the only performance award in the genre not won by “Mare of Easttown.” Michaela Coel won the Emmy for outstanding writing for a limited/anthology series or movie for HBO’s “I May Destroy You.” Colman, accepting her drama-actress Emmy for “The Crown,” called the win “a lovely end to the most extraordinary journey with this lovely family.” “I loved every second of it, and I can’t wait to see what happens next,” Colman said. Best actor winner O’Connor called said appearing in the series about the life and reign of Queen Elizabeth II “has been the most rewarding two years of my life. The cast and crew … you made the show such a pleasure to be a part of, thank you.” He also thanked his family, especially “my grandmother who passed a few months ago and my grandfather,” saying, “your kindness and loyalty has been the greatest gift. Thank you so much.” Among comedy performers, the Emmy not won by somebody on “Ted Lasso” went instead to Jean Smart, who was named outstanding lead actress in a comedy. Smart won for her role as Las Vegas comedian Deborah Vance in HBO’s “Hacks.” While accepting the award, she first honored her late husband, actor Richard Gilliland, who died six month ago. “I would not be here without him,” she said, “without him putting his career on the back-burner so that I could take advantage of all the wonderful opportunities that I’ve had.” She called working on “Hacks” a “thrill,” saying, “I read this and said I have to do this. It checked off every box I was looking for.” She gave special praise to her series co-star, Hannah Einbinder. “I could not have asked for a person to bounce everything off of every day,” she said. “I mean, she’s a natural. She’s a precious human being. She’s incredible, and every day we work is a joy.” “Hacks” also won prizes for best comedy series directing for Lucia Aniello, and for comedy series writing for Aniello, Jen Statsky and Paul W. Downs. Jason Sudeikis won the Emmy for outstanding actor in a comedy for his role as ever-upbeat football-turned-soccer coach Ted Lasso in the series of the same name. “Heck of a year,” Sudeikis said. “I would say that this show is about family. This show is about mentors and teachers. This show is about teammates. And I wouldn’t be here without those three things in my life.” After thanking his family and influences in his life, and the crew of the show, he turned to his fellow cast mates. “I’m only as good as you guys make me look,” he said. “So really it means the world to me just to be up here and just be a mirror of what you guys give to me.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Ted Lasso” also earned both supporting-performer Emmys for comedy series, with Hannah Waddingham and Brett Goldstein claiming the prizes. Both gave thanks to series star and co-creator Sudeikis. “Jason, you’ve changed my life with this, and most importantly my baby girls,” Waddingham said. “… I’m honestly so privileged to work with you, I really am.” A veteran of London’s theater scene, Waddingham punctuated her acceptance speech saying, “West End musical theater performers need to be on screen more. Please give them a chance because we won’t let you down.” Goldstein hailed the show’s entire company, saying, “This cast makes me sick they’re so good.” He called working on the show “one of the greatest honors and privileges” of his life. VH1’s “RuPaul’s Drag Race” won its fourth consecutive Emmy for outstanding competition series. It won over Bravo’s “Top Chef,” which was nominated for the 15th consecutive year, and NBC’s “The Voice,” which had its 10th consecutive nod. Ten-time winner “The Amazing Race,” which was nominated in each of the first 17 years of the category but was not eligible last year because CBS did not air a new season during the eligibility period, was also among the nominees. RuPaul Charles gave thanks for the win “to all of our lovely children on our show from around the world.” “They are so gracious to tell their stories of courage and how to navigate this difficult life,” Charles said. ” … This is for you. And for you kids out there watching, you have a tribe that is waiting for you. We are waiting for you, baby.” With the win, Charles became the winningest Black artist in Emmy history, with 11. HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” won Emmys for best variety talk series and best writing for a variety series. Meanwhile, NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” won its fifth consecutive Emmy for outstanding variety sketch series. Actress, dancer and choreographer Debbie Allen received the 2021 Governors Award from the Television Academy to honor her career contributions to the television world and philanthropic work. “Debbie’s commitment to mentoring underserved communities has been nothing short of extraordinary,” said Debra Curtis, a co-chair of the Governors Award selection committee. “She has shared her gift and love of dance and choreography with countless aspiring performers across the globe.” A three-time Emmy winner for choreography on “Fame” and “The Motown 25th,” Allen is also a Kennedy Center honoree and a winner of multiple NCAA Image Awards. She has done choreography for such entertainers as Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, Dolly Parton and Sammy Davis Jr. Allen’s television directing and producing credits include “Fame,” “Scandal,” “How To Get Away With Murder,” “Empire,” `That’s So Raven, “A Different World” and “Grey’s Anatomy.” Rule changes for 2021 included any films that have been nominated for an Oscar are no longer eligible to enter the Primetime Emmy Awards competition, and any non-documentary film placed on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences platform for Oscar consideration was deemed a theatrical motion picture, and thus ineligible for the Emmy competition. In another change for 2021, nominees and winners in any performer category titled “actor” or “actress” may request that their nomination certificate and Emmy statuette carry the term “performer” in place of actor or actress. No performer category titled “actor” or “actress” has had a gender requirement for submissions. Cedric the Entertainer host the Emmy ceremony, which was televised live by CBS. The ceremony was held in an outdoor — yet enclosed — tent at LA Live in downtown Los Angeles. Producers insisted the show was held in adherence with all health requirements, although the limited crowd sat at full round tables without masks. The bulk of the 119 awards were presented at three Creative Arts Emmy ceremonies last weekend. Those awards are mainly in technical categories, such as picture editing, costuming, hairstyling, makeup and sound, but also include awards for guest acting.

CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke with Dr. Ordon about the show’s latest milestone, return to school and elective surgery safety. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW:  Hello Dr. Ordon! Congrats on kicking off season 14 today. What does 14 seasons mean to you? Dr. O:  It means a lot. I was one of the original fab four as it were. The seasons have evolved. It’s always been the  The Doctors;  plural. We’ve had different hosts; we like to mix it up and emphasize certain areas of medicine. I’ve made the journey 14 years. I’m now sort of in the driver’s seat but I’ve got great co-hosts with me. I am blessed. I go out and whether it be here in the US, the show is in 144 countries; I travel, and people come up to me and they tell me, your show has made a difference, I love watching it, great information, I learn, but I have fun at the same time. That to me, that feedback is priceless. MW:  The theme of this season is health and empowerment. How can people at home help themselves in those two departments? Dr. O:  A lot of us are still at home. It’s a different world. It’s troubling, uncertain times. We’re not quite out of COVID yet. A lot of people are still not getting back to their doctors, I want them to, but they come to us as a source for medical information. We’re going to cover all of our basis how to empower you to be your best health advocate. Health on a budget, dispelling medical myths, sifting through all of this medical misinformation that we’re seeing on the internet. It’s sort of an epidemic within the pandemic, this sort of mistrust mainstream medicine doctors. Why? I don’t know. I think it’s influenced by social media and the internet. We’re going to put our best foot forward and give people the right information based on science and medical information to keep them safe and well. MW:  Glad you said that. It leads into my next question, over the last two years a lot of people put off routine care or elective surgeries. Can you speak to how safe these things are now? Dr. O:  A lot of people did put off things. The whole way we practice medicine has changed. As a plastic surgeon, a lot of things we put in place in the office to make it safer. Everybody has to fill out a questionnaire. Everybody has to wear a mask. Anyone undergoing surgery has to be COVID tested. For the majority of people, we want them vaccinated. It is safe to go ahead, see your doctor, get those yearly checkups. If you’ve been putting off elective surgery, you can do it safely because the hospital, surgery center, doctors’ offices, they’re in tune with what’s going on now. Everything is in place to make sure you stay safe and healthy. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn MW:  We’re also heading into the fall, then the winter shortly after that. We’re getting into flu season. A lot of people want to know, should I get the flu vaccine with the COVID vaccine? Dr. O:  Matt, I’m so glad you brought this up. That’s right fall. What is fall? It’s flu and cold season. Guess what, the symptoms of the common cold and flu mimic some of the symptoms of COVID, so we’re going to have a lot fear, uncertainty. Anybody who gets a cold is going to think they have COVID. We’re going to see a lot more testing going on this time of year. But to your point about flu, so important. We’ve been saying it for 14 years, every year, make sure you get that flu shot. It does make a difference. On top of that, we have to be particularly vigilant because we’re in flu and cold season, wearing a mask, washing our hands, social distancing when you sneeze. A-choo, do it in your sleeve. Something we’ve been preaching for 14 years. All of those things work. MW:  Pull a cape over your face, right? Dr. O:  If you have a cape sure, pull it over your face [laughs] MW:  Fall is also back to school, a lot of kids are concerned, a lot of parents are concerned. What advice do you give for staying safe and healthy in school? Dr. O:  We are concerned for our kids, but at the same time. It’s time for our kids to go back to school, but we have to do it safely. Unfortunately, kids younger than 12, they don’t qualify for a vaccine, yet. But that’s coming up the pipe. The CDC is looking at the Pfizer trials in kids, we’re going to see that soon. In the meantime, kids, they’re in jeopardy. In fact, this week we’re taping the show, one teacher infected basically an entire elementary school in Florida. It’s happening. We don’t want that to happen to our kids so we have to practice everything we know we should do. That’s if anybody has symptoms at home, don’t send your child to school. I’m sorry, masking is better in school. We do have to social distance; I know the kids are excited to be back with their friends, but we have to be smart about it. Kids have to wash their hands, social distancing. I know we’re tired of it and it’s tough with kids to get them to do all of these things, but it’s particularly important. We want them to be safe and back in school. MW:  Thank you for all the insight and the time Dr. Ordon! Dr. O:  Thank you!

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,139 new COVID-19 cases, according to state health department data released Monday morning. The state has not reported new deaths since Saturday because of maintenance on the Vital Statistics Administration’s Electronic Death Registration System. Officials say the reports will resume Monday evening. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .01% to 4.35%. Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 18, to 825. Of those hospitalized, 618 remain in acute care and 207 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 520,236 total confirmed cases and 10,035 deaths. There are 3,844,981 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,799,486 doses. Of those, 3,908,751 are first doses with 3,595 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,547,159 second doses, 4,401 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 297,822 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 98 in the last day. The state reported 82.8% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

I have a big family.”   Carter Theissen and Christian Brown are Wakefield’s great grandsons, who played against each other during Friday night’s game. Theissen plays for Breck School as a wide receiver. Brown is a running back for Concordia Academy.   “I got a little pressure on me with my great grandma here,” Theissen said.   “I’m just glad she’s here,” added Brown.

In my experience, intimate partners are often the first person law enforcement focuses their attention on in cases like this and the warning that ‘any statement made will be used against you’ is true, regardless of whether my client had anything to do with Ms. Petito’s disappearance. As such, on the advice of counsel Mr. Laundrie is not speaking on this matter.   I have been informed that the North Port, Florida police have named Brian Laundrie as a ‘person of interest’ in this matter. This formality has not really changed the circumstances of Mr. Laundrie being the focus and attention of law enforcement and Mr. Laundrie will continue to remain silent on the advice of counsel.

The law, which forbid abortions at 15 weeks, was later struck down by a federal district court judge, who said the state passed an unconstitutional law in an effort to ultimately overturn  Roe V.

Losers of two straight, the Phillies entered two games behind Atlanta in the NL East. The Braves opened a four-game series in Arizona late Monday night against the 101-loss Diamondbacks. The Phillies were 3½ games behind St. Louis for the second wild card. Cincinnati also leads Philadelphia in the wild-card chase. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The Phillies opened a seven-game homestand with three against the 102-loss Orioles and four more against a Pittsburgh Pirates team inching toward 100 losses. The Phillies desperately needed to pile up wins against two teams playing out the string if they wanted next week’s three-game set in Atlanta to have any postseason implications. Here’s what they got instead: an offense led by Harper, an NL MVP candidate, handcuffed by Means, who tossed four-hit ball pitching into the seventh. Means, who pitched a no-hitter May 5, even doubled in the seventh for his first career extra-base hit. Means (6-7) yielded to righty Cole Sulser with runners on the corners, and he retired Freddy Galvis on a flyball to right to end the seventh. Harper, who led MLB with a 1.052 OPS, walked in the first inning, struck out swinging in the fourth and the sixth innings against Means. Harper represented the tying run but flew out to end the game a night earlier in a 4-2 loss to the Mets. The slugging outfielder has been tasked with carrying the Phillies to the playoffs for the first time since 2011 without much help around him. Tyler Wells got Harper on a 401-foot flyball to center in the ninth, then retired J.T. Realmuto and Andrew McCutchen for his third save. The Phillies were booed off the field. Ranger Suarez (6-5) gave up consecutive RBI singles to Pedro Severino and Ryan McKenna in the first inning before he settled down in a game he needed to win. He struck out five and his ERA bumped to 1.60. The Phillies are in the playoff race, though years of mediocre baseball and the start of the Eagles season sapped the city of enthusiasm for the September stretch run. The team announced 21,440 fans — though far less than that seemed on hand. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Losing to the Orioles won’t put a spark in the city. Or fans in the seats. Manager Joe Girardi said before the game pennant races are always fun. This one, though, hurt. “When you think of all the work you’ve put in to get to this point, to have an opportunity to get into the playoffs, to be relevant in your division,” it’s fun, Girardi said. “It really starts the day after last year’s season. You start planning. You start working. Players start doing things. This is what it is all about. All that stuff you did in November and December, January and February, this is what it is all about. We’re fortunate to be in this position. So you have to take advantage of it.” Again, the Phillies couldn’t take advantage against one of the worst teams in baseball. Arizona swept the Phillies in a three-game set in mid-August and the sub-.500 Rockies took three of four in Philly earlier this month. OUT OF OFFICE Orioles CF Cedric Mullins did not start. He has 29 home runs and 30 stolen bases. He entered for defense on double-switch in the ninth. UP NEXT The Orioles and Phillies are each throwing bullpen games with openers TBD.

The U.S. population a century ago was just one-third of what it is today, meaning the flu cut a much bigger, more lethal swath through the country. But the COVID-19 crisis is by any measure a colossal tragedy in its own right, especially given the incredible advances in scientific knowledge since then and the failure to take maximum advantage of the vaccines available this time. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Big pockets of American society — and, worse, their leaders — have thrown this away,” medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan said of the opportunity to vaccinate everyone eligible by now. Like the Spanish flu, the coronavirus may never entirely disappear from our midst. Instead, scientists hope it becomes a mild seasonal bug as human immunity strengthens through vaccination and repeated infection. That could take time. “We hope it will be like getting a cold, but there’s no guarantee,” said Emory University biologist Rustom Antia, who suggests an optimistic scenario in which this could happen over a few years. For now, the pandemic still has the United States and other parts of the world firmly in its jaws. While the delta-fueled surge in infections may have peaked, U.S. deaths are running at over 1,900 a day on average, the highest level since early March, and the country’s overall toll topped 675,000 Monday, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University, though the real number is believed to be higher. Winter may bring a new surge, with the University of Washington’s influential model projecting an additional 100,000 or so Americans will die of COVID-19 by Jan. 1, which would bring the overall U.S. toll to 776,000. The 1918-19 influenza pandemic killed 50 million victims globally at a time when the world had one-quarter the population it does now. Global deaths from COVID-19 now stand at more than 4.6 million. The Spanish flu’s U.S. death toll is a rough guess, given the incomplete records of the era and the poor scientific understanding of what caused the illness. The 675,000 figure comes from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The ebbing of COVID-19 could happen if the virus progressively weakens as it mutates and more and more humans’ immune systems learn to attack it. Vaccination and surviving infection are the main ways the immune system improves. Breast-fed infants also gain some immunity from their mothers. Under that optimistic scenario, schoolchildren would get mild illness that trains their immune systems. As they grow up, the children would carry the immune response memory, so that when they are old and vulnerable, the coronavirus would be no more dangerous than cold viruses. The same goes for today’s vaccinated teens: Their immune systems would get stronger through the shots and mild infections. “We will all get infected,” Antia predicted. “What’s important is whether the infections are severe.” Something similar happened with the H1N1 flu virus, the culprit in the 1918-19 pandemic. It encountered too many people who were immune, and it also eventually weakened through mutation. H1N1 still circulates today, but immunity acquired through infection and vaccination has triumphed. Getting an annual flu shot now protects against H1N1 and several other strains of flu. To be sure, flu kills between 12,000 and 61,000 Americans each year, but on average, it is a seasonal problem and a manageable one. Before COVID-19, the 1918-19 flu was universally considered the worst pandemic disease in human history. Whether the current scourge ultimately proves deadlier is unclear. In many ways, the 1918-19 flu — which was wrongly named Spanish flu because it first received widespread news coverage in Spain — was worse. Spread by the mobility of World War I, it killed young, healthy adults in vast numbers. No vaccine existed to slow it, and there were no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections. And, of course, the world was much smaller. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Yet jet travel and mass migrations threaten to increase the toll of the current pandemic. Much of the world is unvaccinated. And the coronavirus has been full of surprises. Markel said he is continually astounded by the magnitude of the disruption the pandemic has brought to the planet. “I was gobsmacked by the size of the quarantines” the Chinese government undertook initially, Markel said, “and I’ve since been gob-gob-gob-smacked to the nth degree.” The lagging pace of U.S. vaccinations is the latest source of his astonishment. Just under 64% of the U.S. population has received as least one dose of the vaccine, with state rates ranging from a high of approximately 77% in Vermont and Massachusetts to lows around 46% to 49% in Idaho, Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi. Globally, about 43% of the population has received at least one dose, according to Our World in Data, with some African countries just beginning to give their first shots. “We know that all pandemics come to an end,” said Dr. Jeremy Brown, director of emergency care research at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote a book on influenza. “They can do terrible things while they’re raging.” COVID-19 could have been far less lethal in the U.S. if more people had gotten vaccinated faster, “and we still have an opportunity to turn it around,” Brown said. “We often lose sight of how lucky we are to take these things for granted.” The current vaccines work extremely well in preventing severe disease and death from the variants of the virus that have emerged so far. It will be crucial for scientists to make sure the ever-mutating virus hasn’t changed enough to evade vaccines or to cause severe illness in unvaccinated children, Antia said. If the virus changes significantly, a new vaccine using the technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna shots could be produced in 110 days, a Pfizer executive said Wednesday. The company is studying whether annual shots with the current vaccine will be required to keep immunity high. One plus: The coronavirus mutates at a slower pace than flu viruses, making it a more stable target for vaccination, said Ann Marie Kimball, a retired University of Washington professor of epidemiology. So, will the current pandemic unseat the 1918-19 flu pandemic as the worst in human history? “You’d like to say no. We have a lot more infection control, a lot more ability to support people who are sick. We have modern medicine,” Kimball said. “But we have a lot more people and a lot more mobility. … The fear is eventually a new strain gets around a particular vaccine target.” To those unvaccinated individuals who are counting on infection rather than vaccination for immune protection, Kimball said, “The trouble is, you have to survive infection to acquire the immunity.” It’s easier, she said, to go to the drugstore and get a shot. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy in Indianapolis contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Pfizer used a smaller dose of the vaccine for children in their trial and found it to be “safe and well-tolerated, resulting in robust neutralizing antibody responses,” according to a statement from the company released Monday.

But for Christina, another parent, this trial doesn’t provide enough evidence. “I’m not giving my kids the vaccine,” she said. “Because I don’t feel like it’s been fully tested.” The vaccine has already been approved for children 12 years old and older but as cases surge among younger children, Doctor Aziza Shad the Chair of Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital At Sinai said a vaccine will keep kids out of the hospital “Having a vaccine that’s approved by the end of the year could prevent so many children from getting really sick from COVID in the early parts of next year,” said Dr. Shad.

The Emergency Security Relief Act was established for the Emergency Security Deposit Voucher Program — which will provide each family with a security deposit for certain funding under the act. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured City Council President Nick Mosby released a statement following the approval: READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We know the ability to afford quality housing has only gotten more difficult during these long pandemic months. The Council’s action tonight is meant to ease the stress by providing renters in our city up to $2,000 toward their security deposit.   This legislation, sponsored by Council Vice President Sharon Green Middleton, is the final piece of the Council’s first major legislative package. These legislative solutions honor our commitment to ensuring residents have safe, stable and secure homes.   Introduced in January, I worked with my partners on the Council to confront housing insecurity from a number of angles. Two of the bills are now law.   First, we are helping to keep renters in their homes in the midst of the eviction crisis with an innovative approach. Despite a ban during the pandemic, landlords were denying renters the chance to renew their leases and kicking them out of their homes.    Under this law, sponsored by Councilman Tony Glover, landlords must give tenants a reason for not renewing their lease in writing — other than failure to pay rent. These reasons must be limited to what lawyers call “just cause.” That includes a significant breach of the lease or the landlord’s desire to renovate the property or move into it.   Another bill, also now law, sponsored by Councilman Robert Stokes, created a 10-day grace period for tenants to pay their rent before they incur late fees. Aside from guaranteeing more flexibility, this bill helps to make sure people who receive public assistance have actually received their benefits before they’re required to pay rent.   Your Council is also working hard to help our homeowners avoid tax sale, exercising our legislative oversight and making sure eligible residents are signed up for the Homeowners’ Property Tax Credit that can reduce or eliminate their tax debt. Congratulations to Councilwoman Odette Ramos for her work on this issue.   While we await Mayor Brandon Scott’s signature on this final bill to provide relief in the form of security deposits, I want to applaud Vice President Middleton for her diligence in seeing this through. Landlords often require renters to pay a security deposit worth hundreds or thousands of dollars — money that many in our city simply do not have. Our bill gives renters with the lowest incomes priority in accessing quality housing with this one-time payment.   The City Council is a team of problem-solvers working every day on behalf of Baltimore families. No one should be worried about where they’ll live, especially during a global pandemic. Safe, secure and stable homes provide families the foundation they need to thrive.”  MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government                                   ", "sentiment": 0.1297360783156238, "subjectivity": 0.5022546897546899, "wordcount": 536}

The three Texas women arrested  claim they were racially discriminated against, CBS New York’s Kevin Rincon reported Monday.   The chaos last week seemed to be over proof of vaccination at the door, but now a lawyer for one of the women involved says the brawl was triggered by a racial slur.   It took several people to put an end to the fighting captured on cellphone video.   READ MORE :  Caught On Video: Carmine’s Hostess Attacked After Asking Tourists For Proof Of Vaccination   In the immediate aftermath, police charged three women from Texas with assault.   Staff at the restaurant claimed the women became unruly when they were asked to show proof of vaccination.   But now, an attorney for one of the women says that’s not what happened.   “Carmine’s and this hostess, they are trying to hide behind this misplaced use of the vaccine policy to justify her racist and completely outrageous actions that day,” attorney Justin Moore said.   Moore, who represents Dr. Kaeita Rankin, said the hostess used a racial slur during their exchange.   “And we know this predicament wasn’t due to the vaccine. It was due to a poorly trained staff member at Carmine’s who doesn’t know how to deal with women of color,” Moore said.   Rankin was in the city with her niece, Tyonnie, and her assistant, Sally Lewis, on business.   “They are working with a recording artist who was recording some songs in New York,” Moore said.   Carmine’s now says the women did show they were vaccinated.   In a statement the restaurant said, “Three female guests in the party who had shown proof of vaccination and been welcomed into the restaurant without issue then launched an entirely unprovoked, brutal attack on our hosts, one of whom continues to suffer from a concussion.”   Carmine’s said the brawl happened after some men in that same group failed to show their proof of vaccination, adding, “None of the hosts — all of whom are people of color — uttered a racial slur.”   “Now they said that this woman was Asian-American, but we know there has been a long legacy of Asian hatred towards Black people in this country,” Moore said.   In the days after, Carmine’s has said it is grateful, “for all of the support from our community and the city, which has been incredibly touching for our staff.”   But it has been a different story for the three women.   “The fact they’re being casted as folks who are anti-vaccine, and also being casted as ignorant and Black, which is what the prevailing narrative has been. It’s completely injurious to these women. On top of that, and to compound issues, they’ve been receiving death threats as well,” Moore said.   The lawyer is calling for the charges to be dropped, which has driven some in protest and to call for Carmine’s to close.

The Ravens were leading the Chiefs  36-35  and the Sunday Night Football crew figured it foolhardy to risk giving Patrick Mahomes the ball on the wrong side of the 50 and a minute to go. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured But this is 2021, when conventional football wisdom has given way to a healthy heaping of analytics flavored with a dollop of hunch. The revenge of the nerds, if you will. No longer are notoriously risk-averse coaches viewing the 4 on the sideline down marker as a green light to automatically send out the punting team.   \"GO FOR IT!   That's what you did tonight!\"  pic.twitter.com/2WBqqhqTyL   — Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens)  September 20, 2021 Just last week, NFL teams went for fourth-down conversions a whopping 52 times, the highest single-week total in league history. Twenty-five of those were successful. So, “don’t discount the possibility that you go for this,” Collinsworth suggested. “No, you don’t,” retorted Michaels. “It’s going to be one hell of a call, though.” It certainly was. While the seasoned broadcast duo was debating the matter, the camera caught Harbaugh hollering to get Lamar Jackson’s attention. Finally, he ripped off his headset and stepped onto the field. You could read his lips: “Lamar, do you want to go for this?” Of course he did. Collinsworth and Michaels still weren’t convinced. “And Lamar Jackson is going back on the field and they are going for it,” Collinsworth said incredulously. “Or at least the hard count.” “Right,” Michaels said. “At least line up.” “But they have been picking up a yard at will all night long,” Collinsworth interjected on a night the Ravens had already run for 250 yards and three touchdowns. “You’ve got this monster offensive line. You’ve got an extra offensive lineman in there.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “You just have to make sure you don’t jump” offside, Michaels said, still sounding unconvinced. Jackson wasn’t trying to draw the Chiefs offside. He was trying to get the first down, and he took the shotgun snap 5 yards deep and sliced up the middle behind four big bodies for a 2-yard gain. “And Jackson will GET THE FIRST DOWN! ” Michaels screamed as Harbaugh was hugged on the sideline. “And in effect end the game.”   The  #Ravens  go for it on fourth down and Lamar Jackson runs behind the entire Baltimore roster to win the football game 👏  #RavensFlock       pic.twitter.com/6OG3si2BV8   — Billy Heyen (@BillyHeyen)  September 20, 2021 “The guts of a sailor!” Collinsworth said. “He made the toughest call a head coach has to make and look at him. He knows it. That decision just won the football game. They kick that thing back to Patrick Mahomes, who knows what happens? Four offensive linemen on the left side of the center. And Lamar Jackson with the game on the line says nobody’s touching it but me.” One kneel-down and the comeback from 11 points down in the fourth quarter was complete, thanks to two incredible plays, the go-ahead touchdown by a cartwheeling Jackson and linebacker Odafe Oweh’s forced fumble and recovery with 1:13 remaining that handed the sure-handed Clyde Edwards-Helaire his first career fumble. Jackson handed Mahomes his  first loss in September  after 11 victories, sending the Chiefs into third place in the AFC West behind Denver and Las Vegas, both 2-0. “What a game,” Michaels said. “One of the rare times the Ravens were a home underdog. And a crazy game ends the way it does with a fumble and then a fourth-down conversion. A beauty tonight.” “Are announcers allowed to clap?” asked Collinsworth. “I would like to clap for that game. That was something else.” In Week 2, there were 35 conversion attempts on fourth down, with 13 of them successful. The 44% success rate should entice even more fourth-down gambles. Of the 32 games in the books, only three have featured zero fourth-down tries — the Cowboys-Buccaneers and Dolphins-Patriots games in opening weekend and the Texans-Browns game in Week 2. While none has been as pivotal as the Ravens’ game-sealing dare, the Denver Broncos have converted all five of theirs through two games, including three in a Week 1 win over the Giants. Teams are more aggressive than they used to be, as evidenced by the 87 fourth-down conversion attempts so far. “We’ve looked at it hard over the years. Everybody remembers the ones that worked,” Broncos coach Vic Fangio said last week. The ones that didn’t tend to stick in the minds of coaches. “The greatest example I can give you is the Ravens two years ago were 14-2 in the regular season and they lost their playoff game,” Fangio said. “They had a hell of a team. They were going for it on fourth down more than anybody. They have a quarterback that allows them to do more things, but in two of the three losses they had, going for it on fourth down, got stopped several times and it was a major factor in two of their losses, including the playoffs. “It’s nice when it works and everybody loves it, but there is another side of that story sometimes.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

Azie Tesfai, who plays Kelly Olsen, also wrote this episode marking the first time an actor has written for a Greg Berlanti show. CBS ‘ Matt Weiss spoke to Tesfai about her groundbreaking opportunity and what it’s like to become a superhero. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW-  Hello Azie! Congratulations on the new episode of  Supergirl  coming out tonight on The CW at 9/8c. You got the opportunity to become the first actor to actually write an episode for a Greg Berlanti show for this one. How does that feel? AT-  I didn’t know I was the first until I was well into writing it, which is probably a good thing. It’s amazing. I had a really lovely conversation with Greg after and I feel very lucky that I got to be the first and that this character, specifically becoming a superhero and stepping into her power, It all feels very serendipitous. I feel lucky that I get to be the person to do it. MW-  How do you think it would have been different if you had known? AT-  Yeah, probably a freak out or two [Laughs]. This is a lot of pressure, I wouldn’t have wanted to mess this up. I can’t be the last and so I if I don’t get this right I could be. I don’t want to mess this opportunity up or somebody else coming in and saying I want to write and they’re like, we’ve tried this, we’re not doing this anymore. I had already written a sample script for  Supergirl  that I sent to my show runners and they loved it and sent it to Warner Brothers and our producer Greg Berlanti, and they signed off on me writing an episode. I also did the writers room for a month. So I joined the writers room and did the whole 10 to five day, which I’m a big fan, especially during COVID, because we did a virtual writing room. So I was in my pajamas like, constantly and then just put some sort of sweater that felt presentable and had all my food and my snacks and my dog. It was like a dream, I’m like, I could live this, [Laughs]. Like I don’t know why I’m going to set and getting my hair makeup done every day, I could do this. But so that was amazing and then I found out that I was going to write the episode and actually become a superhero; that just blew me away. Then I found out I was the first one to write an episode. So it was good it didn’t all happen at the same time because I think I might have just not been able to go through the process the same way. MW-  That’s a good point it’d be scary to know all that ahead of time. You’re the first and you don’t want to be the last. When you get to set and it’s time to shoot the episode what was that like putting on the suit for the first time? AT-  Emotional, which I was very surprised by the first time you put on your own supersuit it’s like a power you didn’t know you had. You just stand a little taller, it really is a game changer in your confidence, you walk differently. It’s not a normal thing to go to work and put on a superhero suit. Laughs]. So I think I underestimated how how special it was. Our team was wonderful and allowed me to be involved in the design process of the suit. To actually also see it in its final form from the animation that we started with was incredible. We had started two years before initially, before COVID, and then we had six full months to actively develop it with the studio here in LA. We worked with Ironhead who also did the Wonder Woman costume and Batman and I was geeking out non stop pretty much of how cool the process was to make a suit. MW-  Was it a different experience on set for an episode you wrote yourself? AT-  It was very shocking and jarring in the best way. I think from the beginning of writing it to being there on set, just even little things like the signage of a store. I would be like oh my gosh I came up with that! Then I’d take 100 selfies and photos with it. It was very surreal the whole thing. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn MW-  That’s really funny you got this job as an actor, you write an episode, become a superhero; but when you look back it’s the improvement in your posture and the prop store signs you were most excited about [Laughs]. AT:  [Laughs] Everyone thought I was nuts but it is a wild thing to think of a name of something and then see it. It really was a dream come true. MW-  You mentioned you collaborated on the design of the suit. So what parts of the suit were specifically you? AT-  The hair makeup we worked really closely together and so doing the braids was something that I felt lucky that we had an idea with it and they approved it right away. I always wanted to do the half helmet because of the comics and the gold. The gold was pretty quickly approved and then the half helmet logistically, there were concerns like can we do this? Doing stunts and stuff in this but Ironhead was amazing, they figured it out. Then once we had that foundation and the character was visible there were all these other little things that I wanted to do. Things like little gold pieces, the braids, and little accents. They really let me go for it and loved all of the ideas. The costume designers really were great at making it usable too because that’s something I hadn’t thought about. Thing like wearing it after lunch, having interview at home, or like, if I decide to hydrate that day making sure it’s gonna like a lot to take off. You sit in that costume for like 15 hours every day and I was one of the last costumes that needed to be developed so I got the benefit of taking care of all the issues everyone else had for mine. I am by far the most comfortable person on set like, I feel great [Laughs]. So I was very lucky to have my superhero suit come later because I got to benefit. It’s like being the youngest child, like, you know, they figured it out. And then you’re hopefully less damage. Maybe MW-  Your castmate’s pain was your testing ground [laughs]. Last question before I let you go for everyone who’s so excited to finally see you in the costume and to see you as Guardian; what message do you have for the fans? AT-  Man, I hope that you enjoy the episode a lot of hard work went into making it. It’s incredibly personal. A lot of the words that [Kelly] says I wrote with the feelings that I have. It was very, very personal. I felt empowered stepping into being a superhero and I hope that a lot of our fans see themselves in that character and feel empowered. MW-  Congratulations again Azie and looking forward to seeing those sign pictures on Instagram or something so we can all see them. AT-  I’ll start, I’ll post all 400 shots [Laughs] MW-  Lots of slides, can’t wait. Thank you and all the best! AT-  You too Matt, take care!

In a  letter Friday to Attorney General Merrick Garland and U.S. Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal , the five lawmakers asked Garland to reconsider a legal opinion issued under the Trump administration that would send as many as 4,500 people back to prison once the COVID-19 emergency passes. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “These individuals were transferred from correctional facilities to home confinement to stem the spread of COVID-19 after the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) determined that they did not present a danger to the public, but a Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion issued under the prior administration erroneously concludes that they will have to return to prison,” reads the letter signed by U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Reps. Kweisi Mfume, Dutch Ruppersberger and John Sarbanes. Correctional facilities and jails have been the source of outbreaks throughout the pandemic due to the large number of people living in close quarters, conditions that make it easy for contagious illnesses to spread. According to figures provided by the Bureau of Prisons,  more than 250 federal inmates and six BOP staffers have died of COVID-19 . The legal opinion issued by the Justice Department on Jan. 15 found the CARES Act gave the BOP the legal authority to release prisoners to home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic but only while an emergency exists. Once the national emergency ends, the memo states, the BOP is required to bring those prisoners back into its custody. “This OLC opinion incorrectly interprets the CARES Act, and we join Judiciary Committee Chairman (Sen. Dick Durbin) and Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism Chairman (Sen. Cory Booker) in asking you to direct OLC to review and rescind the memo,” said the letter, citing the lack of risk the prisoners posed to the public and the cheaper costs resulting from home confinement. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The letter pointed to the example of Ms. Gwen Levi, a 76-year-old Baltimore woman who served most of her 24.5-year sentence before being released to home confinement in June 2020. Levi was sent back to prison a year later due to a misunderstanding over halfway house rules because she did not answer her phone. Levi was later granted compassionate release despite the DOJ’s opposition. Levi recently described her experiences in an op-ed for  The Washington Post  in which she called for President Joe Biden to step in and keep 4,000 people on home confinement from going back to prison. “President Biden, please act now to keep these people home,”  Levi wrote in the July 15 op-ed . “They are doing everything right, yet they wake up every day not knowing where they will be in a few months, and that uncertainty makes it impossible to plan for their futures. Please remove that cloud. Commute their sentences now.” Citing Levi’s story, the lawmakers asked the BOP and DOJ to support compassionate release and prevent the re-incarceration of those transferred to home confinement. They also echoed Levi’s request for the Biden administration to consider reducing prison sentences for or pardoning prisoners who have complied with the terms of their home confinement.

But lo and behold, the very next day, we experienced a form of mild vandalism,” said Chris Wacha, superintendent of Haledon Public School. Wacha said a day after his son warned him about a challenge called “Devious Licks” last week, someone caused $400 in plumbing damage to the boys’ bathroom. “It’s not good. They need to shut this down. They need parents of the kids to come in and explain. This is a serious matter,” parent Florencio Hernandez said. “For every action there is a reaction, so if you do something that’s not cool, then something not cool is going to happen to you,” parent Machanga Blackmon added.

The viral videos depict as heroes the students who are stealing,” Blumenthal said. The social media site says it has already taken steps to shut down the trend by removing content.

The superintendent said the key to preventing future vandalism lies within kids. “I want them to kind of go through the full decision-making process, and analyze and be an independent thinker,” Wacha said.

But which treatments are best when it comes to fighting the coronavirus? KTVT-TV in Dallas went to Dr. Robert Gottlieb with Baylor Scott & White Research Institute to learn more about each. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “There are many therapies that work on paper, or even in the laboratory that don’t work when you bring them to a human.” said Dr. Gottlieb. “We have to remember that we’re not trying to treat a virus in a test tube, we’re trying to treat a virus in a human being.” At the beginning of the pandemic, doctors tried everything they could to save lives, including some treatments that are now proven not as effective as once thought. With more research, doctors now better understand which ones actually work, and have the science and data to back it up. “We’ve clearly studied hydroxychloroquine,” said Dr. Gottlieb. “We’ve shown that promise is a false promise, that is one of the best study things in the world, and it just doesn’t help for the virus.” Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Early studies showed promise in a laboratory setting, and doctors thought the drug could help keep people’s immune systems from overreacting, but Gottlieb said peer reviewed studies found that it does not benefit patients hospitalized with COVID-19. “We can draw a very complex pathway of why it should work, but we can’t will it into existence as an effective therapy. The data is the data,” he explained. A second treatment showing promise, at least for severe cases of COVID, is the antiviral drug remdesivir. “Remdesivir decreases duration of hospitalization, regardless of oxygen support level required in the hospital. It actually saves lives,” said Gottlieb. The drug received full FDA approval last October for use in adult and pediatric COVID patients 12 and older requiring hospitalization. It’s still being studied for outpatient use. Another potential treatment that’s receiving a lot of attention is ivermectin. It is FDA-approved to treat certain parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions like Rosacea. It also has shown some antiviral properties, but the jury is still out on whether it can be used as an effective treatment for COVID-19. Clinical trials are underway, but Gottlieb said it’s just too early to know if it’s helpful. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We haven’t completely disproved it, but we have no evidence at the moment of efficacy,” Gottlieb said. “So right now, we don’t know that answer. There’s no recommendation for it. I personally do not prescribe it.” Human-grade ivermectin requires a prescription, but it also a drug that’s used for animals. Because of its popularity on blogs and social media, there were reports of people raiding feed stores to buy the animal-grade version. Gottlieb said that is dangerous and could keep someone from getting a treatment that is proven to work. “If someone thinks that they’re being protected by ivermectin and they’re not, you’re really just prescribing them a version of a placebo and losing the opportunity to actually get treated with an effective therapy,” Gottlieb said. “From that standpoint, it really is harmful, because it gives the illusion of protection.” The most promising treatment at the moment in an outpatient setting is monoclonal antibody therapy. “If you have one or more mild symptoms, it doesn’t matter how mild they are, those are the patients we studied, and we showed that we could prevent 70 to 87% of those patients from being hospitalized,” said Gottlieb. “We could actually save lives, if used early.” Gottlieb said there’s three different manufacturers, and there’s no comparative efficacy data. He said the one that’s on the shelf in your healthcare system is the appropriate one. Various centers have opened all across Texas to provide the therapy free of charge. The doctor said outside of clinical trials, it’s important to stick with what we know will work. “Even as I conducted the research, I was really convinced that  therapy X  or  therapy y  would really work,” Dr. Gottlieb explained. “When we’ve actually wrapped up the study and actually determine who’s who, I’ve been very humbled by that answer.” Another type of medication Gottlieb said is proving helpful, and is also cheap and readily available: corticosteroids. They’ve been shown to be beneficial for hospitalized patients needing oxygen, but can actual be harmful for those who are not in that situation. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Gottlieb said the best defense is to get the vaccine. He also said there’s nothing wrong with taking vitamins D and C or a multivitamin. He said while they may not really have an effect on the virus, there’s really now downside and they can make you feel more positive.

(WJZ) —  Families in Anne Arundel County are feeling what is being called a nationwide school bus driver shortage. Some say the shortage is being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tuesday, dozens of families were impacted because of the shortage. READ MORE:  School Bus Driver Shortage Continues To Impact Maryland Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman is calling the issue a crisis and said county buses in Annapolis are now offering to transport students to school for free. “We’re into the first month and here we are starting it out like this, it’s terrible,” said Ryan Brooks, parent of AACPS student. It’s an ongoing problem continuing to affect families. “I got an email saying that bus routes are going to be shorted because we’re short bus drivers,” said Brooks. School districts are in desperate need of bus drivers. “It is a market issue, a labor market issue and we need to get more people driving buses, get them trained, get them hired,” said Pittman. In Anne Arundel County, some parents report their children have been left stranded at bus stops due to no drivers showing up. “So they get marked absent, they get punished for it and it’s not their fault,” said Brooks. READ MORE:  Amid Driver Shortage, Maryland To Expedite Driving Tests & Credentials For School Bus Drivers Brooks said he wouldn’t put his daughter on school transportation because of that reason. “How do you work a full-time job in the morning, make sure your kids might get on the bus, might not and get them fully attended?” said Brooks. “If they have to work seven to three and make sure their child is at school at 7 o’clock also, and what if you only have one car and you have two parents?” According to Anne Arundel County Public Schools website, about 24 bus routes were impacted Tuesday, with more than half without service and the rest showing delays. “Particularly in the Annapolis cluster where one company is having the most problems, one of our contractors is having the most problems hiring staff and keeping them on to drive those buses,” said Pittman. County and school officials said they’re working to fix the problem. “I will be meeting with the contractors myself asking the question, what will it take to get them the incentives, any bonuses they need to be able to hire the drivers they need, we’re expediting that,” said Pittman. It’s not just in Anne Arundel County, Howard, Harford, and Baltimore Counties along with Baltimore City are also dealing with a shortage of bus drivers. “I don’t know what they plan on doing but if they don’t plan on doing it and doing it right soon, it’s going to cause an uproar somewhere,” said Brooks. Governor Hogan is now calling on state agencies to expedite the licensing process for anyone who wants to be a school bus driver.

As the couple walked to their car, they were stopped by two police officers in the parking lot.     According to Baltimore County Police, they were called to the area at around 1:45 a.m. for reports of a public disturbance and reports of a couple fighting.     “We weren’t fighting, I didn’t have no bruises, he didn’t have no bruises, he didn’t have anything, nothing was wrong with us,” said Wanda Redd in an interview with WJZ Tuesday.     The officers questioned Redd and Como and left. The couple said they then got into their car and roughly ten minutes later, police came back, this time with another officer.     “That’s when I decided to pull my phone out and started recording, cuz I didn’t like the energy,” said Como.     In the video, you can hear one officer asking Wanda to see her ID.     “For what?” Wanda replied.     According to Baltimore County Police, police received a second call. Wanda tells the officers, “We not doing anything, sir.”     Then, Como claims, officers went “into attack mode.”     Attorney Governor E. Jackson, III, who represents Redd and Como, said it’s at this point his clients’ rights begin to get violated “and quite frankly it snowballed from there.”     In the video, an one officer can be seen reaching his arm inside Redd’s window and, she pulls his hand away, she claims he hit her.     “Stop, look he’s hit me,” Redd said.     Moments later, another officer breaks open the window on Como’s side.     “From that moment, I thought I was gonna die,” said Redd.     Police arrested Redd and Como.     According to charging documents, Como was charged with assaulting Redd, and Redd was charged with failing to obey and disturbing the peace.     “I feel humiliated. Like I asked over and over, ‘what did I do? Like, what did I do?’… the police officers, they’re supposed to be here to help and serve us. Why am I being hit on?” Redd asked.     “There was no requirement for them to produce identification when they’re not engaged in any illegal activity,” Jackson, the couple’s attorney, added.     Now, the couple is suing the three police officers who surrounded their car that night, and their sergeant, for $25 million in damages, “because of the reckless malicious nature of the officers who we have sued individually and in their official capacity,” Jackson said.     The Baltimore County Police Department tells WJZ this incident remains under administrative review and the arrests have been reviewed by the State’s Attorney’s Office.

Realmuto hit a two-run triple with two outs in the 10th inning to rally the Philadelphia Phillies past the Baltimore Orioles 3-2 on Tuesday night for a boost to their longshot playoff odds. Realmuto lined a shot to right field past the outstretched glove of Anthony Santander, and NL MVP candidate Bryce Harper, who was intentionally walked, scored the winner and set off a wild celebration in the infield. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Down 2-1 and with an automatic runner on third, Orioles righty Cesar Valdez (2-2) intentionally walked Harper. Realmuto then delivered the clutch hit the Phillies badly needed against the 103-loss Orioles. The Phillies entered three games behind Atlanta in the NL East and are chasing three teams for the second NL wild-card spot. Austin Hayes drove in automatic runner Cedric Mullins with a single off Ian Kennedy (3-1) in the 10th inning. But Realmuto provided the late-game thrill that helped the Phillies rebound from a loss in the opener of the three-game series. Harper was thrown out twice on the basepath and crushed the Phillies with careless baserunning in the eighth. Harper, thrown out at second earlier in the game trying to stretch a double, ripped his career-high 39th double of the season off Fernando Abad to lead off the eighth. He moved to third on a groundout and pinch-hitter Matt Vierling hit a grounder to second baseman Pat Valaika. With the infield in, Valaika nailed Harper standing up at home. Without a fifth starter, the Phillies again turned to a bullpen game in front of a paltry 18,955 announced fans. The Phillies trailed 7-0 to Chicago last Thursday in their previous bullpen outing and rallied for a 17-8 win. Adonis Medina, a 24-year-old righty, lasted 3 2/3 innings in his first start and only second appearance of the season. Medina gave up a leadoff double to Cedric Mullins and then drilled Austin Hays in the back in the first inning but pitched out of the jam. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn He went 4-5 with a 5.05 ERA in 17 starts this season for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. “I figured he was going to pitch at some point during this game tonight anyway, so why not do something that he’s comfortable with and start him?” manager Joe Girardi said. Ramon Urias’ RBI single to center off Medina in the fourth gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead. TRAINER’S ROOM Orioles: OF DJ Stewart was placed on the 60-day injured list. He’ll have right knee surgery in the coming days and manager Brandon Hyde said that he should be ready for spring training. Hyde said that Stewart, who hit .204 with 12 home runs and 33 RBIs, had been getting treatment for the injury for some time. “Everybody felt it was the right time for him to shut (it) down and take care of it and be ready for spring training next year,” Hyde said. UP NEXT The Phillies send ace RHP Zack Wheeler (14-9, 2.83 ERA, 231 strikeouts) to the mound against Baltimore LHP Keegan Akin (2-10, 6.93).

The local Black-owned, veteran-owned business takes much of its identity from the siblings. Los Hermanos means “the brothers” in Spanish and 1978 is named in honor of Donta’s birth year. William tells WJZ the brothers have been close since they were young and have always shared an extraordinary bond. Once they had the idea, it only took a year for them to bring it full circle. “We decided we had to do something to leave a legacy,” William said. And so they did.

The siblings’ hard work has already begun to pay off. Los Hermanos 1978 was recognized earlier this year by the New York World Wine & Spirits Competition. Starting soon, customers will be able to savor a taste of their success, too. Los Hermanos is set to be sold at Foundry Row Wine & Spirits in Owings Mills. The Hensons described their signature drinks as an expression of their brotherly love and, of course, their shared passion for well-crafted tequila. But it’s worth noting that they say they couldn’t have accomplished their dream without the backing of their Baltimore community. “I want them to enjoy that and feel like they helped be a part of this process,” Donta said.

The cause of death remains pending final autopsy results.  pic.twitter.com/JoHenMZ9UU   — FBI Denver (@FBIDenver)  September 21, 2021 READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured As WCBS-TV’s Carolyn Gusoff reported, there are now teal ribbons for as far as the eye can see in Blue Point, Long Island. The gesture was originally intended to help bring Petito home. Now it’s a sign of community grief. Organizers have ordered hundreds for surrounding communities. The color — teal — is to reflect the lost 22-year-old’s eyes. “Seeing that beautiful, beautiful girl is just heartbreaking. I hope they find him and I hope he gets justice for that family,” one person told Gusoff. The FBI and police agencies fanned out again across the vast Carlton Reserve in Florida searching by land, air and with K9 units for fiancé Brian Laundrie, who is  still missing  after returning from a cross country van trip without Petito.   By land. By air.  pic.twitter.com/4LFcmwcD2b   — North Port Police (@NorthPortPolice)  September 21, 2021 Officials call the 25,000 acre terrain near his parents house unforgiving. Much of it is waist-deep gator-and-snake-infested swamp. “ATVs, UTVs. We have multiple drone operators that have been sent out in numerous teams. So we will mix the resources and deploy them out, so if they encounter flooded areas, or terrain they can’t access with these wheeled vehicles, we’ll deploy our drones,” said North Port Police Commander Joe Fussell. “Terrain’s very difficult. Essentially, 75% of it is underwater, and other areas that are dry, we’re trying to clear. So we’re expecting to get wet by the end of the day, and check the entire area for Brian Laundrie.” “It’s actually really hard to find someone even if they want to be found out in the wilderness, let alone someone who is being deceptive,” Chris Boyer, executive director of the National Association for Search and Rescue, told WCBS-TV’s Dick Brennan. Boyer explained that a man on the run would likely wear camouflage, only move at night, and cover his tracks by walking along creeks, adding he could move much faster than the authorities. “He just has to be moving to wherever he’s going. Searchers, as they walk along his path, have to be spending time looking behind every bush to see if he’s there,” Boyer said. A major question for authorities is how long could Laundrie hold out on the run. “He’s gonna run out of supplies. He’s gonna want to talk to family. He’s gonna want to know information about where the search is going on, what the status is. He’s eventually gonna have to surface somewhere,” Boyer said.   (credit: Moab Police Department)   Tips continue to pour in with possible sightings, but a news conference to address Laundrie’s whereabouts was suddenly canceled by his family attorney after “a conversation with the FBI.” Gabby Petito Search: Timeline Of Road Trip, Notable Dates And Events READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Petito’s father told Dr. Phil, in a prerecorded interview before the discovery of remains, that he never witnessed his daughter and Laundrie fighting. “Brian was always respectful,” Joseph Petito said. “There were no red flags that popped in my head, that this boy was not a good boy. If there were, I would have discouraged her going on the trip.” Gabby Petito’s mother, according to search warrant documents, was growing concerned about more and more tension between her and Laundrie. In an Aug. 12 police stop captured on body camera , a tearful Gabby Petito claimed she was the aggressor in a petty argument with Laundrie. But a 911 call that led to the stop tells a different story. Caller: “The gentleman was slapping the girl.” 911 operator: “He was slapping her?” Caller: “Yes, and then we stopped. They ran up and down the sidewalk. He proceeded to hit her, hopped in the car, and drove off.” A domestic violence expert said in New York state, one of them would have been arrested. “They would have to arrest someone, even if both parties didn’t want to press charges. It’s a mandatory arrest in that case,” said Keith Scott, director of education at the Safe Center. Scott said that typically, in a toxic relationship, the victim takes the blame. “The abuser is the one that seems calm, he or she may be able to pull themselves together,” Scott said. “The person who is abused may be the one who seems erratic.” A “Bring Gabby Home” vigil was originally set for Friday, but it will now be in her memory. An attorney for the Petito family thanked the media and public for giving them time to grieve, and said a further statement will be made when Gabby Petito is home. Authorities suspended the search and  executed a search warrant Monday at Laundrie’s home in North Port . Law enforcement swarmed the home, and FBI agents escorted Laundrie’s parents to an unmarked vehicle while they searched.

Rob Yang got to spend a ton of time on screen with Daniels, playing a cop named Steve Park. The actor spent six months living in Pittsburgh and getting to know local police officers and residents. CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith chatted with Yang about the experience, what he learned from Daniels and why this show is so important right now. “American Rust” airs Sundays at 10pm EST/PST on Showtime and the first two episodes are streaming now on the Showtime app. READ MORE:  Jeff Daniels On Portraying Jim Comey For ‘The Comey Rule’: ‘Here’s Comey’s Side Of The Story, Authentic” “We shot American Rust in southwestern Pennsylvania on location out of Pittsburgh and that was a completely new place for me,” said Yang. “I lived there for six months. I was really struck by the town there. It’s incredibly beautiful, the whole southwestern Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh area. It’s this historical time capsule and I loved being there. I stayed in this place that was a warehouse loft and I spent some time with local PD to get my cop game on. You can just feel the industry that used to be there and then rejuvenating with promoting tech.” READ MORE:  ‘It’s Huge To Tell A Story Of A Trans Man Of Color’: Leo Sheng On Season 2 Of Showtime’s ‘The L Word: Generation Q’ One of Yang’s favorite parts of the experience was how cinematic the town already looked with its old bridges, rivers and trains.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,145 new COVID-19 cases and 23 new deaths, according to state health department data released Wednesday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .07% to 4.37%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by one to 824. Of those hospitalized, 623 remain in acute care and 202 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 522,355 total confirmed cases and 10,104 deaths. There are 3,855,260 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,820,071 doses. Of those, 3,916,157 are first doses with 4,423 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,556,658 second doses, 5,694 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 298,602 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 362 in the last day. The state reported 83% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 15,917 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 15. Of those cases, 1,186 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.03% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred thirty fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 7.27% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis said the six adults, ranging in age from 23 to 35, were hospitalized after police responded to an apartment on Seminary Road in Falls Church.

He said one of the six is “clinging to life” at a hospital. Four of the six remain hospitalized. Davis said a mother of one of the six called 911 after seeing multiple people unconscious in the apartment.

The investigation is in its early stages, Davis said. But police found a white powdery substance that is being tested. They believe the substance is cocaine laced with fentanyl. He said police wanted to get the word out immediately, before the investigation is concluded, because of the potential danger if others ingest similarly tainted drugs.

Safe Streets is a community-based program to reduce gun violence in high violence areas of Baltimore. Officials said Ronald Alexander, 50, was employed by Safe Streets while he distributed narcotics. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured According to Alexander’s plea agreement, he operated a “drug shop” in northwest Baltimore. Law enforcement monitored his texts and watched him obtain drugs from his co-defendant, a supplier, outside a gas station multiple times. Officials said Alexander used his status with Safe Streets to avoid arrest and evade police. In one instance on August 5, Alexander was stopped by an officer after he rolled through a stop sign, and used his connection with the Mayor’s office to wriggle out of further investigation. “Yeah. Police hopped on me. Told me to get off the phone. You know they scared, you know they scared of the Mayor Office, I said man I work for Safe Streets from the Mayor Office,” Alexander reportedly said on a phone call to a friend after. “I was just coming from one of my participant house, in need with this, it was in need of food due to the pandemic. He say oh, ok ok.” On August 9, Alexander was pulled over after he was seen in a car with his co-defendant, an accused supplier. When officers found 100 grams of fentanyl in the center console, Alexander told officers he took the drugs from a community member as part of his work with Safe Streets to prevent crime. According to the court documents, the officers seized the drugs, but did not arrest Alexander. After that, he met with his supplier and threw away the cell phone law enforcement had tapped. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On August 14, search warrants were executed at multiple locations in the investigation, including Alexander’s house. There, officers seized a 9mm semi-automatic pistol and six cartridges of ammunition, a digital scale and drug packaging material, suspected cutting agents, and Safe Streets clothes. Alexander was prohibited from possessing a firearm and ammunition as the result of a 2001 conviction for heroin distribution. “Ronald Alexander not only polluted the Baltimore community with dangerous drugs and illegally possessed a firearm, but he also risked undermining Safe Streets and other community outreach efforts,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner.  “Our violence reduction strategy is based on strong enforcement efforts focused on those driving the violence and distributing large quantities of narcotics while also providing robust community outreach and prevention initiatives.  Hopefully this sentence will encourage others to put down the gun and give up the drug trade and choose to invest in themselves and their community instead.”       MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government                                   ", "sentiment": 0.1192836792836793, "subjectivity": 0.402969067969068, "wordcount": 502}

While we count on doctors for answers, sometimes the need for a second opinion is overlooked. This is a story about a life-changing medical mistake, and how it could have been prevented and why this family thought they had gotten a second opinion.   “I’m sad, I’m depressed,” Eric Spangs told KYW-TV. “I have an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness a lot the time.”   Spangs’ life fell apart after hearing words from doctors that everyone dreads. First, it was, “You have cancer.”   “I thought ‘Oh my God,’ what am I going to do if I lose him, we have five children,” Eric’s wife, Melissa, said.   Then they heard, “We made a mistake.”   But, instead of being relieved with the mistaken cancer diagnosis, the couple was crushed because Eric had already had his prostate removed. “It’s devastated me emotionally and physically,” Eric said.   Before the surgery in January, Eric, who lives outside Reading, had everything to live for — a good job, a happy family, and a bright future. “We’re 48 years old,” Melissa said as she became visibly upset.   Their odyssey started when Eric had a slightly elevated PSA level from a routine blood test that checks for prostate cancer. After that a series of other tests, including a biopsy. “The error occurred in the preparation and reading of his biopsy. It was another patient’s biopsy that was put on those slides,” attorney Aaron Freiwald said.   Freiwald filed a medical malpractice lawsuit on behalf of the Spangs. “This is the most egregious story I’ve ever heard,” Freiwald said.   Based on the alleged inaccurate biopsy, Eric had a radical laparoscopic prostatectomy, a surgery that was supposed to save his life “There’s always urinary leakage, there’s erectile dysfunction. They’ve taken away my ability to be a man, they’ve taken away my emotional stability,” Eric said.   KYW-TV reached out to the organizations named in the lawsuit. Tower Health says it can’t comment on pending litigation. The Center for Urologic Care of Berks County did not return KYW’s calls.   Most cancer surgeries are lifesaving and safe. So how could Eric’s situation have been prevented? The American Cancer Society says second opinions from oncology specialists are a good idea.   Eric did get second opinions during this, but they were all from the same medical group, which doesn’t specialize in oncology.   “I had faith in the medical team, faith in medicine and I don’t understand how this happened,” Melissa said.   Now, they’re learning to live with disbelief and anger, feeling compelled to warn others. “We just don’t want this to happen to anybody else,” Melissa said. “Nobody should have to go through this.”   Eric and Melissa wonder and worry about the other patient who got Eric’s biopsy results. They say the doctor told them now he has to tell that guy that there was a mix-up and he has cancer.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The nursing profession, which was already stretched before the pandemic is now in greater demand than ever before. “I have seen ups and downs with the nursing shortage, but this is clearly the worse that I have seen it in four decades,” said Wiser. Doctors say there could be several factors behind this, from the baby boomer generation getting older to nursing burnout. “It has resulted in some nurses electing to leave the profession for the time, some nurses electing to become traveling nurses because financially, the compensation they receive is considerably more than what they receive as an employee in one of our hospitals,” said Dr. Jane Kirschling, Dean of University of Maryland School of Nursing. “This is rigorous… you’re always on and you have to be on point all the time, so that can be a stressful occupation and vocation after a while,” said Wiser. Doctors say the covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. “At one time that their work level may have been let’s say four patients, five patients, six patients, well now they’re taking up to ten patients over a 12-hour shift,” said Wiser. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Officials say the rising demand for patient care with not only unvaccinated patients due to the COVID-19 delta variant surge but also patients resuming non-elective surgeries and procedures put off since the beginning of the pandemic has put a strain on hospital systems dealing with a shortage of nurses. That’s why Notre Dame of Maryland University School of nursing is working to address the shortage by speeding up the process to become a nurse through an accelerated program to help students like Kathryn Newsome earn a nursing degree in just 15 months. “Being in the medical field is always something I wanted to do,” said Kathryn Newsome, nursing school student at Notre Dame of Maryland University. University of Maryland School of Nursing officials are also seeing a strong applicant pool and admission numbers. They say their goal is to keep graduates in state to practice. “Nursing gives you flexibility, it gives you very much a livable wage, it gives you the opportunity to care for people at some of their most vulnerable times of their life,” said Kirschling. For Newsome, the shortage of nurses is a trend she hopes will turn around as more people recognize the importance of the profession. “I just want to make a difference and Be able to help people who are in need,” said Newsome.

Researchers wanted to know what role our breathing plays in the spread of this virus.

The researchers found variants are spreading better among people after testing 49 COVID-infected people. “People sit with a cone in front of their face that is collecting all of the air coming from around their head,” Dr. Milton explained. The cone is called Gesundheit TWO and it measures how much virus is in their breath. The test was conducted with people’s masks on and with their masks off. And the results show that those with a variant were breathing out more virus. “Eighteen times more in the air,” added Dr. Milton. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Anne Simon was among those tested and said she was shocked at how much COVID was coming out of her. Simon caught COVID while outside at her farm sitting next to someone who was infected. “We eat outside occasionally together and little did we know one Sunday afternoon, one of us had COVID,” she said. Within the first few days of getting sick, Dr. Milton tested Simon for the study. “Without a mask, just breathing normally, talking softly, they were able to measure a substantial amount of COVID on droplets,” said Simon. Dr. Simon said as the virus gets better at getting into the air, the public needs to be better about keeping it out of the air. While the study revealed that masks cut down the spread of the virus by half, Dr. Milton said with variants becoming more airborne, masks should be worn tighter around the face. For example, the big difference between a surgical mask and an N-95 is that surgical masks have room around your face for the virus to get in and out, Dr. Milton explained.

As WCBS-TV’s Lisa Rozner reports, the search for Petito was fueled by social media sleuths captivated by her and fiancé Brian Laundrie’s cross-country travel posts on Instagram and YouTube. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured In her hometown of Blue Point, Long Island, supporters believe it pushed the investigation forward. “Thank God Gabby had a 50,000 platform community that she contributed to because that’s part of why this is so national,” said Carol Seitz, president of the Blue Point Chamber of Commerce. It’s the kind of national coverage that the father of 24-year-old David Robinson hopes for. He was last seen leaving his job in Buckeye, Arizona, in June. His vehicle was found crashed in a desert. “Emailing, texting, emailing, reaching out to whoever,” father Daniel Robinson said. Twenty-five-year-old Illinois grad student Jelani Day was reported missing in August, last seen on surveillance video entering a retail store. Neither were covered in national headlines. “Story selection in any newsroom is not an exact science,” said Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University. “What images and video and photography and witnesses are available. It’s a whole mix of those things, but the decision-making happens also in a context of who’s making those decisions, and if that newsroom doesn’t represent the community it’s covering, then those decisions are going to look different.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Often these folks are white, they’re upper to middle class. So there’s a feeling of connection that they may not even be aware of because how we align across certain fault lines of race and class and gender and the white influence, how we see events. Also cable news has an outsized impact on the sort of larger discourse. And so when this is covered, like CNN and other places, then other news organizations pick it up and then it goes wide,” said Martin G. Reynolds, executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. “This isn’t to say that these journalists are bad folks or that this isn’t a worthy story … What I think is really essential is the understanding of the choices that we make as journalists are an articulation of value.” The Black and Missing Foundation says 40% of missing adults are people of color. “My role is to ensure that our missing are household names as well,” foundation co-founder Natalie Wilson said. “Media coverage is so important because one, it alerts the community that someone is missing and it can greater the chance of a recovery, but it also adds pressure to law enforcement.” In the state of Wyoming, where Petito’s body was found, the organization Not Our Native Daughters says more than 700 indigenous people went missing over the last decade. “Hopefully we’re in the moment now where we’re able to recognize that there is disparities when it comes to a white person missing versus a Native American, or even an African American or Hispanic,” organization director Lynnette Grey Bull said. Columbia University journalism professor June Cross recalls students having trouble getting the green light on a 2016 documentary about missing afro-Latino women in the Bronx. “It was impossible to get coverage. It was impossible to get the police to even think about investigating these cases,” she said. “We produced a report called ‘Normalizing Injustice’ … and actually talked to writers and producers, they felt like people would turn off the TV if the victim was a black woman,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change.

Chances are he’ll receive the warmest welcome any departed Boston athlete has received in their return, considering the absolutely absurd 20-year run he had with the Patriots responsible for those six Super Bowl banners that now hang in Gillette Stadium.   That run, technically, started when the Patriots drafted Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. But no one knew the incredible heights that Brady and the Patriots would reach in the near future at that time, as Brady was buried on the New England depth chart. He spent his rookie season as the team’s fourth quarterback, making just one brief appearance that season.   Brady did not see his first  real  action for the Patriots until Week 2 of the 2001 season — 20 years ago today — when he replaced a very injured Drew Bledsoe late in the fourth quarter of a 10-3 loss to New York. The rest, as they say, is history.   Bledsoe miraculously played a series that Sunday afternoon after Mo Lewis  leveled him on the sideline , a massive hit that gave New England’s big-money quarterback a concussion, a collapsed lung and internal bleeding. Bledsoe nearly died from the violent collision.   It obviously sidelined Bledsoe for a while, and paved the way for Brady to take over. And take over he did, leading the Patriots to an 11-3 record as the team’s starter and an improbable Super Bowl run with an even more improbable title-clinching win over the St. Louis Rams.   But all of that, and the other five Lombari Trophies he won as a Patriot, were a long time coming when Brady took the field back on Sept. 23, 2001.   Looking Back At Tom Brady’s Patriots Debut   The fresh-faced, slightly pudgy (compared to today’s Tom Brady) quarterback took the field at Foxboro Stadium with 2:16 left and the Patriots trailing 10-3. He completed his first pass, a four-yard hookup with Patrick Pass. Then he completed another for nine yards to Troy Brown. After an incompletion to Brown, the two hooked up again for another nine-yard connection, and Brown moved the chains when Brady hit him for another three yards on a third-and-1 to bring the Pats into New York territory. That was the start of a beautiful relationship between Brady and Brown.   It kinda felt like Brady was about to lead the team on a game-tying drive. It could have been the first of many comebacks that the quarterback would lead the team on over the next two decades. But it was not meant to be that Sunday, as a holding penalty on Joe Andruzzi wiped out a nine-yard reception by tight end Jermaine Wiggins and pushed the Patriots back 10 yards.   Brady ran for nine yards on the ensuing first-and-20 and then picked up 21 yards on a nice connection with David Patten, putting the Patriots on the New York 29-yard line. But there was no comeback magic as Brady’s next four passes fell incomplete, and the Patriots walked off the field with a 10-3 loss and an 0-2 record.   New England was not in a great spot after that defeat, but little did anyone know that it was the start of something special. Just when things were looking worse and worse for the Patriots, Tom Brady came and saved the day.   ‘He Will Go Out There And Perform At A Good Level’   The former Michigan man had impressed during training camp and the preseason, prompting Bill Belichick to elevate Brady on the depth chart over veteran Damon Huard, slotting the 24-year-old in as Bledsoe’s backup.   After that Week 2 loss to the Jets, Belichick expressed confidence that Brady could lead the way until Bledsoe returned.   “I really don’t think that I am going to be standing here week after week talking about all of the problems that Tom Brady had. I have confidence in him, I think the team has confidence in him and I think that he will prepare himself well and he will go out there and perform at a good level,” Belichick said,  via NBC Sports Boston’s Tom E. Curran . “I am sure that like every other young player there will always be something in the game that you would like to do differently. People say that about every player young or old. It is always going to be that way. Everybody will make a mistake in the game, but I think overall that he will perform within the framework of the offense that we have designed for him and he will make plays that he is capable of making. That is what my expectations are and I think Tom will work hard to respond to that opportunity.   “Nobody ever likes to see a teammate go down especially a warrior like Drew, just to go back in the game in that situation and the condition that he did shows the kind of toughness and grit that he has and what he is respected for, but at the same time every player likes to play, every player wants to take advantage, of an opportunity and I know that Tom has prepared hard and that is what a backup quarterback’s job is,” Belichick continued. “To be ready when the opportunity arises. It was a tough situation that he was thrust into last night, but overall I thought he responded to it pretty well. I just wish we could have made one more play.”   Brady got his first start the following week against Indianapolis, as the Patriots pummeled the Indianapolis Colts 44-13 in Foxboro. It was Brady’s first win as a starter, though he threw for only 168 yards and no touchdowns in the victory. (The New England defense had a pair of pick-sixes and three interceptions overall on Peyton Manning that afternoon.) He wouldn’t throw his first touchdown pass until Week 5.   But by the time Bledsoe was ready to return, Brady had won the starting gig. As the season went on and the Patriots continued to win games — mostly thanks to the defense, but also thanks to some extremely calm and cool play from Brady late in games — you couldn’t help but feel that something special was building in Foxboro.   That all began on Sept. 23, 2001, when Tom Brady took over at quarterback, the start of an incredibly remarkable run that will never be repeated in the NFL.

About 182 million people, or 54.9%, of the US population, are fully vaccinated, the data shows. That leaves 71 million people, or 25.1% of the eligible population, who are not vaccinated. “We are bracing ourselves for an awfully busy winter ahead,” Dr. Megan Ranney, associate dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, told CNN on Tuesday. The country is once again at a point where an average of more than 2,000 people are dying of Covid-19 every day, according to data from  Johns Hopkins University. And hospitals are straining to keep up with the number of patients coming in. Staff shortages and employee fatigue in Pennsylvania hospitals have reached a point where some health systems are offering signing bonuses, loan forgiveness and other incentives to staff. In Wyoming, nearly 100 members of the state’s National Guard were activated Tuesday to assist hospitals dealing with the surge. And though it isn’t clear yet what this year’s flu season has in store, it could add additional stress to an already pressed health care system. “Flu is still a killer, not as much as Covid-19, but between 12,000 and 50,000 Americans lose their lives every year from flu,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Flu numbers were actually relatively low last year, but experts said that doesn’t necessarily foreshadow how this year will turn out. “Let’s be clear on why flu cases were so low last year, it’s because we were all masked and we were all distancing,” Ranney said. “Those things are not being done anymore in the vast majority of the country.” Vaccines are the surest way to get the pandemic under control, experts have said, but rates are still lower than they need to be. Health officials are now asking the public to get both their Covid-19 vaccines and flu shot. Pediatricians recommend that both adults and children 6 months and older receive their flu vaccinations by Halloween, Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children’s Hospital, told CNN. Some vaccine clinics around the country are offering both shots — and encouraging people who come in for one to make sure they have the other. “If somebody comes in wanting the flu vaccine and they haven’t had a Covid vaccine then we can encourage them to get both, or vice-versa,” said Dr. Robert Hopkins, chief of general internal medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and chair of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee. If health care providers can encourage people to do both, “We potentially are going to have a greater impact on both disease prevention efforts,” Hopkins said. Two-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine 94% effective, company says Pfizer has suggested a third dose of its vaccine will boost protection for those already vaccinated, and now Johnson & Johnson has announced an extra dose of its vaccine is helpful as well. A two-dose version of the vaccine provides 94% protection against symptomatic infection, the company said Tuesday — making a two-dose regimen of J&J’s Janssen vaccine comparable to a two-dose regimen of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine was given emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration on February 27. It has been given to about 14.8 million Americans, according to the CDC. The company released some details of three studies looking at various aspects of its Janssen vaccine, and said that, taken together, they showed the vaccine provided long-lasting protection that could be boosted with an extra shot. “Our single-shot vaccine generates strong immune responses and long-lasting immune memory. And, when a booster of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is given, the strength of protection against COVID-19 further increases,” Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of Janssen Research & Development, said in a statement. The company’s ongoing Phase 2 trial of a two-dose regimen showed giving two doses 56 days apart provided 100% protection against severe Covid-19 and 94% protection against moderate to severe Covid-19 in the US. A second study showed people given a booster shot six months or longer after their first dose had a 12-fold increase in antibodies — compared to a four-fold increase for people who got a second dose at two months. So, protection should be stronger if people get boosters later, Dr. Dan Barouch, head of Beth Israel Deaconess’ Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, told CNN. The protection provided by Covid-19 vaccines appears to wane over time, especially for people 65 and older, a CDC expert said Wednesday. “For individuals 65 plus, we saw significant declines in VE (vaccine effectiveness) against infection during Delta for the mRNA products,” said Ruth Link-Gelles, who helps lead the CDC’s Vaccine Effectiveness Team. Link-Gelles reviewed a series of studies looking at the overall effectiveness of vaccines in various groups between February and August and found similar patterns for Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, both made using mRNA. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is meeting to discuss the potential need for booster doses of vaccines, and is discussing vaccine effectiveness and safety in general. The committee will be back at 12 p.m. Thursday now that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it would grant emergency use authorization for a booster dose of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine in people 65 and older, people at high risk of severe disease and people whose jobs put them at risk of infection. Death rate four times higher in least vaccinated states The average rate of Covid-19 deaths in the 10 least vaccinated states was more than four times higher over the past week than the rate in the 10 most vaccinated states, according to a CNN analysis. In the least vaccinated states, roughly eight people out of every 100,000 residents died of Covid-19 over the past week, compared with only about two out of every 100,000 people in the 10 most vaccinated states. CNN used data from Johns Hopkins University and the CDC for the analysis. Less vaccinated states tend to have higher hospitalization rates, too. The latest data from the US Department of Health and Human Services shows an average of 39 Covid-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 people in the 10 least vaccinated states, nearly three times higher than the average rate of 14 per 100,000 people in the 10 most vaccinated states. The states with the lowest vaccination rates have fully vaccinated less than 45% of their residents. They are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming. The 10 states with the highest vaccination rates have fully vaccinated more than 62% of their residents. They are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,405 new COVID-19 cases and 16 new deaths, according to state health department data released Thursday morning. The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .01% to 4.38%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 32 to 792. Of those hospitalized, 610 remain in acute care and 182 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 523,760 total confirmed cases and 10,120 deaths. There are 3,860,068 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,829,889 doses. Of those, 3,919,875 are first doses with 3,718 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,561,005 second doses, 4,347 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 299,063 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 461 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 83.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

They can develop in children, too. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Three out of 10,000 children have a cataract, according to the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. “Age of presentation is variable. Some babies are born with cataracts. Other children develop cataracts at various points throughout childhood. The age of presentation depends on the cause of the cataract,” says Samantha Feldman, M.D., a pediatric ophthalmologist at the Krieger Eye Institute, a LifeBridge Health center. A cataract, whether in an adult or a child, is a clouding of the lens that can occur in one or both eyes. Pediatric cataracts can be idiopathic (meaning they can occur spontaneously without a known cause) or result from genetic disorders, infections, trauma or other systemic diseases. Cataracts can be large or small. The size often determines whether the cataract is visually significant. If the cataract is large, Feldman says, parents may notice a white spot in the pupil or a dim or white reflex on photos taken with flash. “It is also possible for eye misalignment to develop due to the poor vision. However, poor vision may not be apparent in young kids, especially if only one eye is affected,” she adds. Although cataracts can cause blurry or cloudy vision, not all children will complain of a vision problem. This, in addition to parents sometimes missing abnormalities, is why it’s important for children to get routine examinations by their pediatrician. “Pediatricians may note an abnormal red reflex in the newborn nursery or during a routine well-child check and refer the patient to be examined by a specialist,” Feldman says. “The pediatrician’s office also performs vision screenings that can pick up on eye misalignment and poor vision.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Small cataracts that aren’t affecting the child’s vision should still be frequently monitored by a pediatric ophthalmologist. In some cases, glasses or patching may aid visual development in children with a cataract that’s tiny or off center and surgery can be delayed or even avoided, according to the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. But once it’s apparent that a cataract is causing vision problems, it should be removed as soon as possible. Because children’s eyes and brains are still developing, a delay in removal could lead to lifelong visual impairment. It is especially urgent to remove a visually significant cataract that is present at birth. “Surgery may be required as early as four weeks of age,” Feldman says. Although cataract surgery performed by an experienced surgeon is generally considered safe, no surgical procedure is completely without risk. Some risks associated with pediatric cataract surgery include:   infection   bleeding   inflammation   retinal detachment   glaucoma   loss of vision   lack of improvement in vision or poor visual outcome due to amblyopia   the need for additional surgery   displacement of the intraocular lens (an artificial lens for the eye)   development of cloudiness in the visual axis   anesthesia complications   Depending on the age of the child, an intraocular lens may or may not be inserted. After surgery, children may require patching, glasses and/or contact lenses. An intraocular lens may be inserted at that time or in the future when the child reaches an appropriate age. Your child’s pediatric ophthalmologist can explain the benefits and risks of pediatric cataract surgery in greater detail if the procedure is necessary. “If there is a known systemic or genetic disease, such as diabetes or Down syndrome, or if there is a family history of childhood or early-onset cataracts, then a yearly eye exam is a good idea,” Feldman says. “However, for most normal kids, the pediatrician will examine the child’s eyes at each well visit and can refer the patient to a pediatric ophthalmologist if there are abnormalities such as an abnormal red reflex, strabismus, nystagmus or a failed vision screening.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Pediatric cataracts is one of many conditions treated by the Krieger Eye Institute team.

A judge heard from attorneys for both the Commonwealth and the State Police Association of Massachusetts in Suffolk Superior Court.   The union, which represents 1,800 members, argues that the state needed to bargain with workers before implementing the mandate, which states that 44,000 executive department employees must show proof of vaccination by October 17 or risk losing their jobs.   They also argued that by putting that deadline in place, it essentially precludes members from getting the two dose Moderna shot, and will shortly rule out the two-dose Pfizer vaccine as well, leaving members with just the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as their only option.   The troopers’ union asked the judge for an injunction to pause the mandate.   The Commonwealth says it did negotiate with the union and that potential penalties for failing to meet the mandate can be ironed out after the deadline.   “There has to be situations where there is an ability of the government, in an exigency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, to have a deadline of implementation of policy,” said Jennifer Greaney, an attorney for the Commonwealth.   In general, Boston University health law professor Michael Ulrich says the state has the authority to implement a vaccine a mandate.   “As we’ve seen, states have broad authority to mandate vaccines in general, but also with state employees. And then, really with police, you have an even stronger argument because, one, they have to be out in public,” Ulrich said.   The judge did not issue her decision at Wednesday’s hearing, but said she will make it promptly.   According to the attorney representing the union, roughly 20-percent of State Police employees remain unvaccinated.   The union filed a lawsuit September 17 to get Baker to delay the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.   The union wants members who’ve previously had COVID-19 or who choose not to get the vaccine for either medical, religious, or personal reasons to be able to take a weekly test and wear a mask on the job.   They’re also requesting that if a member contracts COVID-19, becomes ill from the vaccine, is forced to retire because of coronavirus, or if they were to die, that it be considered a “line-of-duty” injury.   If they’re not given time to negotiate, the lawsuit argues, it could result in “irreparable” harm to troopers.

Survivor 41  is only a few hours in and we already have two castaways out of the game. Leading up to this season Jeff Probst described the latest version of  Survivor  as a  monster  and unfortunately for Eric Abraham, he was the monster’s first victim; followed shortly by 23-year-old  Sara Wilson . CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to Abraham about his  Survivor  preparation and the prospect of returning to the game someday. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Full Survivor 41 Episode One Recap MW-  Hi Abraham, sorry we’re having this conversation so early in the season but it’s nice to see you! EA-  [Laughs] I know, good to see you too though, Matt. MW-  Going back to the start when you first stepped foot on the island, you’re a  Survivor  fan for life, what was that moment like? EA-  It was surreal. I mean, to watch this show throughout the years and actually be there, it’s almost like you’re watching yourself. I was like No, I’m not really here, I’m still back home. But I was actually on the island about start off one of the greatest adventures that you have no control over.  Survivor  is going to go the way it’s going to go but I had a blast. MW-  And you got thrown right into it the thick of things with that immunity challenge, what was the hardest part of that for you? EA-  Know what, it’s just a matter of can I move fast enough? Am I in the right place? Am I doing the right things? Am I drawing attention to myself? Or should I just have fun? I had blast though, ask JD about his two ribs. I had a blast. MW-  [Laughs] When I talk to him I’ll be sure to mention it. What kind of preparation went into getting ready for the island? EA-  So what I did was I went into what I call my “ Survivor  Lab.” I would go look at different episodes of  Survivor  and I would physically work out. Like okay, that’s a stamina thing and I’ll need strength in my arms for this or that. I just kind of looked at it and enjoyed reliving some of the episodes I hadn’t seen in a while. I looked at some of the challenges that have happened in the past and I was ready. I really put in the work. MW-  Were there any former  Survivor  players in particular you wanted to model your game after? EA-  Well, you know what I like the swagger of Boston Rob because he was like, ‘I’m from Boston. I’m doing what I’m doing.’ Jane’s physicality, Jane was like, ‘Look, I’m tearing up everything. I’m here to be physical.’ READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn My game plan was also a little Richard Hatch because that was my very first season watching. He just didn’t care, he was like, ‘Hey, I’m Richard and I’m gonna do what I do.’ I also wanted to build relationships like Rudy and bring different types of people together. I think that’s what  Survivor  is all about. MW-  That’s a solid group to take inspiration from. You seemed like a real natural leader out there as well, did you plan on playing things that way or did that just develop based on who you were out there with? EA-  Well, I spent 22 years in the military, so it’s is there. Do I want to use it, that’s a different story. [laughs]. That can get you voted off so you kind of walk a fine line. How much of my real personality do I want to show? Am I going to really let them see me? What am I going to hold back? So I wanted to bring everyone together, let’s all work together and be a team. Let’s try to stay away from voting and make it more of an inclusive type thing. MW-  Your plan going into tribal was to vote out Tiffany, clearly things didn’t go that way. What’s going through your mind when you realize things hadn’t gone to plan? EA-  It was too late. I had painted Tiffany because Tiffany gave me enough paint to paint away. When we did the first challenge, I was like hey Tiffany didn’t pull her away. We did the next challenge. When you play  Survivor  you’ve got to get the target off your back, even if there isn’t a target on your back. You’ve got to get people to say, you know what, I see what what he’s looking at. Then when I got the votes; I just didn’t see it coming. MW-  As you reflect on your experience now, what are you going to take away from  Survivor ? EA-  You know what, it’s twofold in the in the sense that I was out there and not just representing me but my family. I dedicated my show to my mom. She raised three boys and now one of her boys is on one of the top shows on CBS. She just called me and said they cheated me out of the show [laughs] and my mom is 70, she doesn’t play. Just to have an opportunity to be with this cast this season too, I part of a diverse cast of individuals that lived out a dream that we all had together. It was a great experience. MW-  I think I know the answer this last question, but just to get it on record. If you have the chance to go back out there again are you taking it? EA-  They just showed a snippet of me this season. They didn’t want to give you a full Abraham experience just yet. They said, you know what, we’ll give you a snippet and next time I’m on the show. I’ll be there much longer. I’m coming back.  Survivor  fans, that’s not the last you’ll see of me! MW-  I’m looking forward to that. Next time we talk it’ll be much deeper in the season I hope! Thank you so much Abraham been a pleasure talking to you. You did a great job representing yourself and your family out there and hope I see you soon! EA-  Hey, thanks Matt!

If so, when should she get the shot? And of course, is the vaccine safe for the unborn baby? We now have answers. As CBS New York’s Dr. Max Gomez reports, in a study just published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology-Maternal Fetal Medicine, NYU researchers measured antibody levels in pregnant women who had been vaccinated and later measured those antibodies in their newborns. “When the baby is born, we call it a neonate, and they had not only antibody, but very high levels of antibody, which means that the infant will be protected for several months of life,” said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, with NYU Langone Health.

Importantly, doctors were also able to distinguish between antibodies from the vaccine as opposed to antibodies from a previous  COVID  infection. Bottom line? “Vaccination affords protection not only for the mother but for the infant as well that you’re saving. You could possibly be saving two lives with vaccination,” Lighter said.

Did you miss the two-hour season premiere last night? Here’s what went down on the first episode of  Survivor 41 …   Photo Courtesy of CBS   READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured As  Survivor  has now entered its third decade, this season is already off to a wild start. That’s right; this new game of  Survivor  is definitely “a monster.” Minimal supplies. No food. Powerful game-changing twists. Oh, and did I mention, the game is now 26 days?! But don’t be fooled; even though the game is shorter, based on last night’s episode, this season is moving at an even faster pace. Starting off, it’s pretty clear that this game is unlike any other season. Right away, host Jeff Probst informs each tribe that they’ll only receive one pot, one machete, and one flint. On top of that, they won’t have any rice or food source. But before receiving their pot, machete, and flint, they must, of course, compete for it. Between the three new tribes, Luvu, Ua and Yase, it was the Ua tribe who dominated the victory and got to receive their pot, machete, and flint with no repercussions. The other two tribes, on the other hand, were in for a rude awakening… Meet the Tribes: Luvu Tribe (BLUE)   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Danny McCray, a 33-year-old ex-NFL player from Frisco, TX Deshawn Radden, a 26-year-old medical student from Miami, FL Erika Casupanan, a 31-year-old communications manager from Toronto, Ontario Heather Aldret, a 52-year-old stay-at-home mom from Charleston, SC Naseer Muttalif, a 36-year-old sales manager from Morgan Hill, CA Sydney Segal, a 25-year-old law student from Brooklyn, NY The Luvu tribe didn’t have the best, nor the worst, first impression on the opening challenge of this episode. Even though they came in second, they were still up for an additional task to get their pot, machete, and flint. This granted task was called “Savvy or Sweat.” The tribe had to choose two people to complete either a “savvy” task or “sweat” task – a puzzle or a more endurance-based challenge. The Luvu tribe chose Danny and Deshawn to complete the “sweat” task that involved transferring water into a big bucket – Survivor-style. If completed in under four hours, they’d receive their supplies. Since the two castaways had to separate from the tribe right away, Luvu all agreed on the “no strategy rule” until they finished. And well… that didn’t last long. While checking on Danny and Deshawn, Naseer thought he saw the two hunting for idols. Naseer immediately scrapped the “no strategy” rule and rushed to tell the tribe what he thought he saw. In just under four hours, Danny and Deshawn finished the savvy task, and, of course, strategy was back on. Sydney was the one who told Deshawn about Naseer being weary about them. It’s only the first day in, and this tribe’s strategic game is moving fast. But, will their strategy pay off? Yase Tribe (YELLOW)   Photo Courtesy of CBS   David Voce, a 34-year-old neurosurgeon from Chicago, IL Eric Abraham, a 50-year-old cyber security analyst from San Antonio, TX Evvie Jagoda, a 28-year-old Ph.D. student from Arlington, MA Liana Wallace, a 20-year-old college student from Washington, DC Tiffany Seely, a 47-year-old teacher from Plainview, NY Xander Hastings, a 20-year-old app developer from Chicago, IL Meanwhile, the Yase tribe came in dead last on the opening challenge. Let’s just say, it was so bad; Probst even said it may have been the “biggest embarrassment for day one in  Survivor  history.” But, the Yase tribe used this underdog energy to empower them, while keeping a positive attitude by saying their “only way to go is up.” That is, until they were, too, granted with the “Savvy or Sweat” task to gain their supplies. On the Yase tribe, both David and Xander got the “sweat” task done, finishing it under the given four hours. We see a lot of gameplay on the Yase tribe as well. An interesting thing about this season, especially showcased through the Yase tribe, is that we’re learning even more about who these castaways are back at home – just like in the old school  Survivor  seasons. Getting to know their backgrounds allows us, viewers at home, to connect with these castaways deeper and get even more invested in their game. I love that about  Survivor !

Since they earned their supplies right away, the tribe didn’t have to be tasked with any “Savvy or Sweat” challenge. Instead, we got to see a wide range of what kind of games these castaways were all about playing this season. One stand out on the tribe, JD, who is younger than this show itself, gave a big impression to the tribe right off the bat. Being a super fan himself, it was clear JD had a plan to build his social game from the start. However, this can be risky at the beginning of the game, as it may be a bit obvious. Ricard noticed JD’s strong and sociable demeanor and began considering him a major game threat. Meanwhile, this episode also highlighted Shantel (Shan), a pastor from DC. From the looks of it, Shan is working with everyone on the social level. She’s using the ‘pastor image’ to her advantage to gain trust, but she certainly knows she’s here to make some big, potentially backstabbing moves! Not going to lie; she was a massive stand-out on this episode – I’m impressed with her so far! Survivor  Summit   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Ah yes, as  Survivor 41  is clearly showing, there are more and more twists by the minute. And, by the second day, we were thrown another loop to watch unfold. The ‘ Survivor  Summit’ involved each tribe selecting one person to get on this mysterious boat and just straight up “find out what happens.” Since the tribes were unsure of the outcomes, it wasn’t straightforward with who should go. After some debating, and even just good ol’ drawing rocks, it was down to Danny from the Luvu, Xander from Yase, and JD from Ua to all be taken to the “unknown.” The three departed individually from their camps and arrived at another island nearby. This nearby island greeted the three selected castaways with a sign that said something along the lines about getting to know one another as they must walk this steep path up a hill. After their hike, the three got to know each other pretty well… hopefully well enough to make an individual, gut-based decision. That’s right; these three were up to make yet another,  Survivor  game-changing decision. The decision was simple – each of them, individually, must either choose “risk their vote” or “protect their vote.” Pretty simple, right? Not so much. The “risk their vote” option meant they had a chance to receive an extra vote. The “protect their vote” option means nothing happens. The thing is, these three castaways had to make their decision based on their gut feeling of the other two. If all three castaways chose “risk their vote,” they’d all lose their vote at the next tribal council. However, if it’s a split decision, and just one person chooses “protect their vote,” and the other two choose “risk their vote,” then those two people will receive that extra vote advantage. If the two people chose “protect,” then, in that case, just that one odd person would lose their vote. Given that they do not know what the other castaways will select, this was a difficult decision (and difficult got me to explain, ha). In the end, Danny went back to his tribe honestly and told them he selected “protect.” While Xander, on the other hand, went back to his tribe honestly and said he chose “risk.” That left it to JD to indicate which way this advantage or disadvantage would go. JD went to his tribe and shared that he chose “protect.” Being skeptical, Ricard said behind the scenes that he did not believe JD was telling the truth… but was Ricard right? Immunity Challenge   Photo Courtesy of CBS   The season premiere Immunity Challenge was a huge opening, literally. Not only was this challenge huge and physically exhausting, but Probst dropped another twist onto these three tribes. This new twist is called the “shot in the dark.” Probst shared how this twist would only be in effect at tribal council. Each castaway would be given a “shot in the dark” dye where they would have the option to drop their dye into a bag, privately in the voting booth, if they felt like their name was on the chopping block. This meant, if you dropped your dye, you would not vote, yet, you would get a one-in-six chance of saving yourself from getting voted out. It’s literally a “shot in the dark” because who knows what name you may draw out of that bag – and chances of pulling your own name are pretty slim. Now, the Immunity Challenge itself was, of course, intricate. So intricate that  Survivor  even dropped a new game for junior players to join in! This is called “The Game within the Game.” A puzzle appeared on the episode for a few seconds, encouraging young  Survivor  viewers to visit “SurvivorGwg.com” to play more. I visited the site, and it’s a pretty cute add-on for kids this season! Check it out here! After an exhausting series of obstacles, it was down to the final, infamous  Survivor  puzzle between the Ua and Luvu tribes to win it (Yase, again, fell pretty behind). As always, in  Survivor , there’s no room for mistakes. And, unfortunately for the Ua tribe, it was just that. While they were in the lead, Sara and Shan made a crucial mistake by accidentally keeping one puzzle piece in a bag. This cost them… big time. Luvu won the first Immunity Challenge, which meant both Ua and Yase must head to a back-to-back Tribal Council. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention – these two tribes also had to give up their flint on top of their loss… yikes. Tribal Council – Yase Tribe In this first episode, the Yase tribe had a pretty slow start to the game. At the beginning of the episode, Tiffany, a die-hard  Survivor  fan, didn’t make the most significant impression on Abraham, who seems to be a natural leader. Abraham was determined to get Tiffany out, as he viewed her as weak right off the bat. However, Tiffany’s social game was working pretty well during these first few days. It seemed like she aligned herself with the right people. The vote was clearly between the two, but it was Tiffany’s social game that saved her. This meant Abraham was the first one out of this season of  Survivor 41 , as he felt surprised and “blindsided” while his torch got snuffed. Eric Abraham Castoff Interview   Photo Courtest of CBS   Tribal Council – Ua Tribe The Ua tribe was more than ready to cast their votes. But let’s just say, the actual strategy at tribal council got pretty messy. At first, as viewers, you see that Shan is in the middle. It becomes clear she is the swaying vote – and that’s exactly what she wanted. As Ricard felt threatened by JD’s social game, he, of course, wanted the young lad voted out first. This left things pretty complicated though because Sara was the other target since she lost the challenge on the puzzle. Things became more and more complicated, as it suddenly became a “LIVE” tribal council instead. Castaways began whispering to one another from left to right. Tribal was getting heated. As paranoia settled in, the ballots all seemed like they were between either JD, Sara, and at one point, even Brad. This tribal was so chaotic; the castaways even teased the idea of using their “shot in the dark” advantage. In the end, there was no shot in the dark, just one clear vote. Sara was the next person that got voted out on  Survivor season 41 . And, on top of that, in private, both Xander and JD received their “extra vote” advantages from the summit …which means, was JD lying to his tribe this whole time? Sara Wilson Castoff Interview   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Wow. That’s really all I can say so far about this season. Just… wow. There are quite a few intense twists in  Survivor 41  so far – did you keep up with them all? In my new  Survivor  Pool , I was given the two castaways, Genie and Abraham. And welp, it looks like my odds of winning are pretty slim now! Who do you predict to win this season? Let me know what you thought of the  Survivor 41  premiere, and tweet me  @mick_cloudy  !

SW-  [Laughs] No it’s all good, nice to see you too! MW-  You know you did accomplish something that not many people have or ever will just getting on the show. As you look back on your experience how do you feel even making it to the island? SW-  It’s been a lifelong dream of mine and even though it didn’t end the way it hoped I think back to the moments of getting the call I made it on, sitting on those boats going to the shore and those are now some of my core top 10 memories; no one can take that away from me regardless of that outcome. Honestly going during COVID too we didn’t know if it was even going to happen. It could have easily not happened so I’m just so blessed and thankful to have been a part of it and that we were able to go out there. MW-  When you arrived on the island and took that first step on land what’s that moment like? SW-  Honestly surreal. I mean I’m looking at the boat, I’m looking at Jeff Probst! I’m like, this is Jeff Probst, that’s him! I’m not kidding I couldn’t believe this was actually happening it’s so surreal. It was a moment I thought about and was waiting for my whole life and I’m so happy it happened. MW-  Obviously you’re a huge fan so you were familiar with the same, how did you prepare? SW-  I’m a big athlete, I was a water polo player and a swimmer so I really banked on that. I was like if there’s just one swimming challenge I’m the girl for it; obviously you didn’t really get to see me use it so that was sad. The mental preparation was there too though, I felt really solid about my strategies to be honest. I knew how I wanted to play the game and it’s also really hard to strategize beforehand because so much of it is dependent on the whole cast and who’s on your tribe. It was also really about mentally preparing myself because I hadn’t left LA in the entire year of the pandemic. Now all of a sudden I’m being flown out to Fiji, it was very jarring. I just prepared myself for that and prepared myself for any of the outcomes that could have happened. Going out at the first tribal was like worst case scenario, but I feel like I set myself up nicely to know I can handle this. MW-  I hate to bring this up but clearly the puzzle during the immunity challenge was an issue. There are a lot of people at home who couch quarterback and say ‘if I was there I could have done it’ or ‘how hard can it really be’. Now that you’ve been in those shoes, what’s it like being in that high stress situation and trying to fit all those pieces together? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn SW-  You know, it felt like it was going well. Chen was emptying and I was putting them in and we had a  really good rhythm with it, then all of a sudden it just melted. It’s hard because I’m so competitive and there’s so much pressure with Jeff Probst screaming at you, your teammates are trying to scream at you from behind you and it’s so hard to stay level headed. For us that one piece was so integral to connect the puzzle, it was a very difficult puzzle. I knew something was wrong and it was just hard to get past that. I feel like. But like you said as someone who is good at puzzles, I’ve definitely watched the show and thought it’d be easier. When you get out there you realize, oh my gosh, it’s way harder than it looks I promise you. MW-  And then the chaos didn’t stop there. You go a live tribal council and everyone is trying to figure out what to do next, what’s going through your mind as everything is unfolding all around you? SW-  Honestly the live tribal was the best thing that could happen for me because the vote was pretty much locked on me before we went to tribal. I went into that tribal thinking, I’m 100% going to play my shot in the dark because I don’t have any other chance. Then I kind of got this idea before tribal I mentioned to Chen and Ricard maybe let’s do Brad. Brad had put our names out and someone literally tells someone they’re going home isn’t someone you can work with in the long term. I was really trying to pitch for it because I felt like that was the only person I had leverage against. Nothing against Brad, I just needed it to be anyone but me. When the whispers were happening, out of the back corner of my eye I saw Chen whisper to Ricard saying Brad. I knew they weren’t lying to me but I also knew I wasn’t safe. MW-  When that torch goes out and your time in the game is over did you at least take some solace being that close to Jeff as a big fan? SW-  I didn’t even like acknowledge him [laughs]. I felt like I was so dazed, honestly I feel like I blacked out. I was just like is this really happening? You don’t come to  Survivor  to get voted off one the first council, it’s very disappointing. I was very heartbroken, I was upset, but I knew someone had to go home. I feel like I carried myself with a lot of elegance, a lot of poise and it just is what it is. I’m still very proud of myself! MW-  I think I know the answer to this already but given the chance, would you go back out there? SW-  Is that even a question?! Of course! [laughs] Going out there and getting voted out early, it sucks but it’s not the end of my story, it’s the beginning. It’s literally given me so much fire on the inside, I am just chomping at the bit to get back out there. MW-  Happy to hear it, you represented yourself very well out there and I’m sorry the game came to an end so soon but hopefully we’ll see you back out there. Thanks for the time Sara and all the best moving forward! SW-  Thank you so much, you too!

The Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers have all split their first two games The Ravens are coming off a huge win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night. It was the first time that Lamar Jackson has beat the Chiefs in his young career. The Browns also picked up their first win at home against the Houston Texans. The Bengals and Steelers both lost tough ones. In Week 3, the Bengals head to the Steel City to open the intra-division schedule. It will be a battle of offenses struggling to keep their quarterbacks upright and put their teams back on track. The Browns host the Chicago Bears, with rookie Justin Fields starting under center for the first time. And then the Ravens finally get a break from primetime, when they go out on the road against the Detroit Lions.

Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Cincinnati Bengals @ Pittsburgh Steelers, Sunday, September 26 @ 1:00 p.m. Ben Roethlisberger comes into the Bengals game with a left pec injury sustained in last week’s loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. He’s not the only one  banged up . Outside linebackers T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith, wide receiver Diontae Johnson and cornerback Joe Haden and inside linebacker Devin Bush also made the growing list. Big Ben’s injury situation wasn’t helped by the offensive line play in front of him. The Raiders sacked him twice and knocked him down 10 times. Running back Najee Harris struggled to just 38 yards on 10 carries. The Steelers had just 29 yards as a team. They’ll face a Cincinnati run defense that held David Montgomery to 61 yards on 20 carries last week and Dalvin Cook to the same numbers in the week prior. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow doesn’t have much help in front of him either. “Poor Joe Burrow,” said Viviano. “He has no offensive line. I mean they’ve invested in a lot of things around him. But plus that, you would think after he got hurt, that would have been a priority for them. Clearly they missed out on that one.” The Bears sacked Burrow five times in Week 2 and knocked him down plenty more times. The young quarterback didn’t help his cause either, tossing three picks on three consecutive passes. If Burrow can stay on his feet, he may find Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins (if he’s healthy) for some nice gains. The Steelers gave up 382 yards passing and two touchdowns Derek Carr last week. “I think this can be a closer game than you might otherwise think,” Viviano speculated. “I see the Steelers pulling it out. They’re at home, they should win this. I see them winning by like six points. But without an offensive line on either side, there’s a lot of unpredictability going in.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University Chicago Bears @ Cleveland Browns, Sunday, September 26 @ 1:00 p.m. The Bears’ Week 3 matchup with the Browns may mark the beginning of the Justin Fields era in Chicago. The rookie will start at quarterback after replacing the injured Andy Dalton in Week 2. A few years ago, the Bears similarly pinned their hopes on the now-gone Mitchell Trubisky. “Mitch Trubisky got his first NFL start on the road in the AFC North and beat the Baltimore Ravens in Baltimore,” Viviano recalled. “And in that game, he only threw 16 passes, completed eight of them, only threw for like 100 yards. But their defense won the game. So if you want to use a little history as a possible harbinger of good things for the Bears, you got that.” The Bears may look to once again follow their defense instead of an inexperienced leader. That unit, led by Khalil Mack, Robert Quinn, and Roquan Smith, made life difficult for Burrow and contained Joe Mixon on the ground last week. The Browns will be without Jarvis Landry, who will miss three games or more with a knee injury. Odell Beckham Jr. could return to the field in Week 3, however. This Cleveland offense is built to run behind Nick Chubb. He has 178 yards and three touchdowns on 6.8 yards per carry in his first two games. And given how many receivers Baker Mayfield threw to last week, the offense has plenty of passing options. Baltimore Ravens vs. Detroit Lions, Sunday, September 26 @ 1:00 p.m. The Ravens finally overcame what quarterback Lamar Jackson has called their “kryptonite.” They beat the Mahomes-led Chiefs. “To be trailing by 11 points going into the fourth quarter and shut out in Kansas City in that fourth quarter, while scoring two touchdowns, that was something,” as Viviano tells it. “You could call it a signature win, but the team will tell you as they’ve been telling us, it only matters if they build on it.” The Ravens will have their chance to build on it this week in Detroit against the Lions. Baltimore has struggled with injuries early on, losing three running backs for the season. But the running game has still thrived, largely because of Jackson’s playmaking ability with his feet. He had 86 yards on 12 carries against the Raiders and 107 yards on 16 carries against the Chiefs. Ty’Son Williams has also been productive out of the backfield in the first two weeks. The Ravens have seemingly overcome issues along the offensive line. The unit that struggled to slow a Raiders pass rush in Week 1 improved against the Chiefs, leading to about 500 yards of offense. Alejandro Villanueva’s move to the left tackle in place of Ronnie Stanley was one of the reasons, as Viviano sees it. The Lions have opened the season with two losses to two probable contenders. They allowed 41 points to the 49ers in Week 1 and 35 to the Packers in Week 2. The Ravens will look to continue that trend. But can a Lions offense now led by Jared Goff keep up? The former Ram has 584 passing yards and five touchdowns in his first two outings. The normally stout Ravens defense is giving up the most passing yards per game (376) through the first two games.

Any given Sunday, but this should be one that the Ravens handle well.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.07556909382752079, "subjectivity": 0.4271780809702157, "wordcount": 1160}

Larry Hogan on Thursday announced the state is taking action to shore up the medical workforce. As part of the effort, Maryland is removing roadblocks that kept nurses who are licensed in other states from providing nursing care here. Besides that, the state is asking nursing programs to let select nursing students graduate as soon as possible. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “This week, Maryland reported the nation’s lowest COVID-19 rate, and we continue to withstand the Delta variant surge better than just about any other state,” Gov. Hogan said. “While our hospitalizations remain well below all of our pandemic surge capacity triggers, we are taking proactive steps to maximize the ability of our hospitals to increase their nursing workforce.” Moving forward, the Maryland Department of Health will  allow registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who hold active licenses in other jurisdictions to practice in Maryland , a measure backed by the state’s Board of Nursing. In addition, the Maryland Higher Education Commission is encouraging nursing programs statewide to let qualified nursing students “exit early” and enter the workforce. This can be done either by letting students take exams sooner, streamlining the final weeks of the semester or advancing high-performing students. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We want to be clear about what exactly early exit is and is not,”  MHEC Secretary James Fielder wrote in a letter Thursday to nursing schools’ deans and faculty . “Early exit is not a change in the curriculum. All learning outcomes, course objectives, and program outcomes must be preserved.” Dennis Shrader, secretary for the state Department of Health, is also encouraging hospital leadership and schools to collaborate on ways to maximize the use of nursing students and waiving the license requirement for students enrolled in physician assistant students to practice. The goal of these steps, Hogan said, is to give hospitals more flexibility to deal with staffing needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “We have worked closely with our hospitals, healthcare associations, and many others in the state on this solution that will further our ability to continue to provide quality care to Marylanders,” Shrader said. “Nurses and student nurses have been invaluable in our fight against COVID-19 and so much more and these steps will ensure that hospitals can use all available nursing solutions.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.13273809523809524, "subjectivity": 0.44761904761904764, "wordcount": 425}

After going winless with a 9.61 ERA in his first six appearances, Lowther (1-2) got into a rhythm against the light-hitting Rangers in this matchup of last-place teams. Lowther allowed three hits and notched a career-high seven strikeouts in his finest outing as a big leaguer. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Tyler Wells worked the ninth to complete the five-hitter and earn his fourth save. Mountcastle hit a solo shot in the fifth inning off Glenn Otto (0-3) for a 2-0 lead. Mountcastle earlier this month set the Orioles record for home runs by a rookie — eclipsing the 28 by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1982 — and leads the team with 31 homers and 84 RBIs. Hays went deep in the eighth, his 22nd homer of the season and eighth in September. The Orioles still own the worst record in the AL (49-104), but this was a nice start to the final homestand of a difficult season that featured a 19-game losing streak and an alarming inability to win at Camden Yards, where they’re 24-51. It’s been a struggle for the Rangers, too. Texas (55-98) has lost five straight and eight of nine, and appears a good bet to finish with its first 100-loss season since 1973. This would be only the third time the Rangers reached triple-digit defeats since the franchise moved from Washington in 1972. Otto gave up two runs and five hits with seven strikeouts in five innings. It was his fifth start since coming to Texas in the July 29 trade that sent Joey Gallo to the Yankees. K TIME Lowther and Otto entered with no wins between them, and each had an ERA in excess of 9. Yet, both struck out the side in the first inning, and Lowther set a new career high with two more strikeouts in the second. Not to be outdone, Otto also fanned two batters in the bottom half. ROOKIE RACE Two of the leading candidates for AL Rookie of the Year honors are participating in this four-game series. Texas OF Adolis Garcia came in batting .243 with 30 HRs, 83 RBIs. In addition, his 14 assists were second-most among big league outfielders. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Mountcastle was at .258, and his homer put him ahead of Garcia in homers and RBIs. Tampa Bay OF Randy Arozarena (.271, 19, 65) has the advantage of playing for a first-place club, but Texas manager Chris Woodward believes Garcia’s defense is the difference-maker. “He’s made big-time plays time and time again in big moments,” Woodward said. “That should be worth a little bit more.” Garcia is more interested in finishing strong than garnering votes from baseball writers. “Those are things I can’t control,” he said through an interpreter. “I’m just trying to get things done on the field.” TRAINER’S ROOM Orioles: INF Ramón Urias is done for the season after being placed on the 10-day IL on Wednesday with a right adductor strain. … OF Anthony Santander (hamstring) is a “day or two away” from returning and is “going to be sore probably for the rest of the year,” manager Brandon Hyde said. UP NEXT Rangers: Right-hander Spencer Howard (0-4, 6.86 ERA) tries again to get into the win column on Friday night. It will be his 14th start and 18th appearance in 2021. Orioles: Rookie left-hander Alexander Wells (1-3, 7.96) strives for his first victory since winning in relief on June 29 at Houston. ___ MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

Here at WJZ, we wanted to address this issue head-on. That’s why Vic Carter and Rick Ritter hosted “A Talk About Race,” a half-hour town hall that brought together people from all walks of life to discuss where we’ve been, where we stand and where we go from here. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured For Baltimore, it’s an issue that hits close to home after the in-custody death of Freddie Gray in 2015. And while his death has resulted in changes within the Baltimore Police Department, many people feel strongly there is more work to be done. So, during the town hall, we tackled the uncomfortable questions.  How can we confront institutionalized racism? What can we do to improve police-community relations? What do meaningful progress and change look like? The goal was to reckon with our past and come up with solutions for the future. But we couldn’t do it alone — we invited five panelists with different perspectives to share their thoughts. The Voices   Bishop Antonio Palmer with the United Black Clergy of Anne Arundel County;   John Wesley, spokesman for Baltimore’s Office of Equity and Civil Rights;   Adam Jackson, CEO of Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle;   Ericka Alston, CEO of ACCESS Granted;   Retired Sgt. James Spearman with the Annapolis Police Department.   In Their Own Words Below are a handful of thoughts our panelists shared during the town hall. To watch the complete discussion, click play on the video player above. Spearman:  “One of the things that I always say is that no law enforcement agency, no matter how good they are, if they don’t have the support and trust of the people, they’re just an occupying force and nothing ever gets done. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done in the community, but there’s also a lot of work that needs to be done within law enforcement.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Alston:  “My most heartbreaking experience comes from asking a young person, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ ‘Grow up, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow.’ That’s our reality. Our young people are hopeless. There is no evidence around them that outside of those that live in their home, that someone cares about them. If they’re in a school system designed to fail, they’re intentionally and strategically placed in a pipeline to prison. … Our young people need to be seen, heard, respected and invested in.” Jackson:  “When you have a structural problem, it requires and necessitates a structural response. And that takes time because all we’ve gotten is the opposite for many years. And Baltimore is a city that has suffered from system disinvestment over decades and generations. And I think what people want to see, like for me, it would be to go down to Penn North and to see all the buildings renovated and to see people happy and safe.” Wesley:  “We have to find a way to help the officers. The community has to find a way to help these officers spend more time in these communities when they are not there for enforcement. You know, we expect them for enforcement. But we don’t expect them to do things things like, you know, I used to speak at schools and I’d ask kids, ‘What do you want to be?’ When the Officer Friendly programs are out there, inadvertently all the boys said, ‘I want to be a fireman. I want to be a policeman. That is no longer the answer. Nobody wants to be a policeman. I think that speaks volumes.” Palmer:  “If you don’t believe that Jesus had melanin in his skin and you believe that everybody else that looks like me are cursed people, then you’re going to continue to endure privilege, you’re going to continue to allow injustices to take place and be silent about it, you’re going to continue to allow a police officer to commit brutality and fatality and so forth without saying a word. And your congregations of thousands of white folks are going to follow suit. But if you lift up your voice — if a Franklin Graham, who has a national platform, will stand besides a TD Jakes and say, ‘together we fight’ and ‘together we’ve had enough of this’ — it’ll start turning around.” More From ‘A Talk About Race’ Here’s some of the conversation that didn’t make it into the half-hour special:   In Case You Missed It MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government If you weren’t able to tune in Thursday evening, we’ll be re-airing ‘A Talk About Race’ on CBSN Baltimore.

A CDC panel officially approved those Pfizer booster shots Thursday afternoon. “Like you, I’m approaching this decision with an interest in doing what’s right for the public health,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC Director. Rumer is fresh off her first shot and she hopes the unvaccinated family sees the data and follows suit. “I’m hoping that soon they will change their minds. That’s part of the reason I got mine was to protect them because I know they’re not going to do it themselves,” Rumer said.

(AP)  — The Baltimore Ravens needed another yard to secure their victory over Kansas City. By that point, they had every reason to feel confident. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “We have to have an array of things throughout the season to have ready for those situations,” offensive coordinator Greg Roman said. “It’s interesting. Whatever plays we run in the game, there’s also a lot, lot, lot, lot more that we didn’t run. Things for that type of situation, the players are working on that stuff every week.” Lamar Jackson picked up the first down on that final fourth-and-1, and the Ravens finished with 251 yards rushing in  their 36-35 victory  over the Chiefs last weekend. A couple of weeks ago, Baltimore’s running back group was decimated by injuries, and the team was quickly collecting available veterans in an effort to fill its many holes. Now, the Ravens are right where they’ve been at the end of each of the past two seasons — ranked No. 1 in the NFL in rushing. “We made a lot of progress last week with all the new guys that are here. We were able to clean up some things,” Roman said Thursday. “Credit to our offensive staff (and) all the position coaches.” The Ravens lost J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards for the season before it even started. Although running backs sometimes seem interchangeable these days, Baltimore needed a significant overhaul at the position without much time to pull it off. Ty’Son Williams had no NFL carries to his credit, and newcomers Latavius Murray, Devonta Freeman and Le’Veon Bell were just arriving. “I think if you look back maybe even a few years ago, and to think if we were all in the same room, it would be a cap problem or something like that, right?” Murray said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Through two games, the Ravens have averaged 220 yards on the ground. They’ve extended their streak of 100-yard rushing games to 41, two shy of the league record. Baltimore’s top rusher is its quarterback, and it helps that Jackson has been healthy — although he did miss practice Thursday because of an illness. Jackson rushed for more than 1,000 yards each of the past two seasons, and he’s at 193 so far in 2021. “He’s a dynamic player who has rare ability, rare talent, and he touches the ball 67 times a game, 70 times a game,” said Detroit coach Dan Campbell, whose team hosts Baltimore this weekend. “Look, you play the odds, you do everything you can to limit their explosives, but inevitably, even as good as you can play, you look, they rush for 100 yards, what is it, 41 consecutive times? That’s what they do.” Williams is Baltimore’s leading rusher aside from Jackson. He’s run for 142 yards on 22 attempts — 6.5 yards per carry. Murray has 64 yards on 19 carries with a couple of touchdowns. “There’s a lot of ways that we can hurt you, and again, it starts with Lamar just being beside you,” Murray said. “Not knowing if he’s going to keep it or give it, that right there is just difficult in itself. Then with all the different things that we’re doing, coming at you north and south and then getting the ball outside, it’s just tough on the defense.” Freeman has only two carries this season, but one of them went for 31 yards. Bell has been on the practice squad. So the Ravens still have other options they can turn to — and more wrinkles they can add. “There’s a lot that goes into this, and you try to choose wisely on game day,” Roman said. “I think we ran 36 different runs in that game, completely different runs, and I promise you, we had a lot more on the shelf.” NOTES: WR Marquise Brown (ankle), S DeShon Elliott (concussion), T Ronnie Stanley (ankle) and DE Derek Wolfe (hip/back) did not practice Thursday either.

CBS Denver has followed the  extraordinary journey of Ahmad Siddiqi  since it began last month. He escaped Afghanistan with the help of Army veteran Scott Henkel and his wife Heidi.   The two men forged a friendship 14 years ago when they served together in Afghanistan. Henkel says Siddiqi saved his life.   (credit: Henkel family)   When the Taliban took control last month, the Henkils, of Broomfield, Colorado put their lives on hold and, using every connection they had, helped Siddiqi, his wife and four kids evacuate. The family is now headed to Colorado where their story has inspired a massive show of support.   Heidi says it’s been a whirlwind two weeks as coordinating donations has become a full-time job.   “We had bikes donated. We have had clothes. We had a car donated as well. It’s just been this outpouring of love.”   A local police officer and his wife even opened up their home to the Afghan family.   “I’ve been completely blown away by people’s generosity,” said Scott.   There’s a bunk bed and a playset for the kids, who Scott says no longer have to fear the Taliban.   “Can’t wait for them to go play and be free and safe.”   Local moms also donated Afghan spices and dresses for Siddiqi’s wife.   “It was really neat to have local mothers come together and say ‘How is the mother doing? Because we know there’s a large burden that she’s bearing as well,'” said Heidi. “One of the things I wanted to make sure is we had photos of his home where he grew up to make sure they had at least some sort of piece of home.”   (credit: Henkel family)   A home that Scott says his friend will likely never return to.   “Our dream of going back one day and going fishing in some of these streams you see there, it’s never going to happen. Not in our lifetime, but I know and hear in his voice how excited he is to start his life here in America.”   Scott says he always knew he would see Siddiqi again.   “But never in my wildest dreams think he’d be a neighbor. How cool is that? We’re going to be better. I know we’re going to be better with Afghans in the community. Absolutely, we will be a  better society and country.   (credit: Henkel family)   The Henkels received so much interest in the Siddiqui family, they set up a Facebook page for them. Ahmad, they say, is already getting job offers since he speaks four languages. The children — who speak English — are already enrolled in a nearby elementary school.   The family should be here in the next couple weeks, and the Henkles are planning to reunite Scott’s entire Army team from Afghanistan to spend Thanksgiving with the Siddiqi’s.   The family is among 856 Afghan refugees who are expected to resettle in Colorado.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,363 new COVID-19 cases and 14 new deaths, according to state health department data released Friday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .1% to 4.28%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 20 to 772. Of those hospitalized, 587 remain in acute care and 185 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 525,123 total confirmed cases and 10,134 deaths. There are 3,865,944 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,842,216 doses. Of those, 3,924,568 are first doses with 4,693 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,566,331 second doses, 5,326 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 299,613 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 550 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 51,704 additional vaccine doses, 1,758 in the last day. The state reported 83.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

(WJZ) —  For the second year in a row, Anne Arundel County Public Schools have been forced to alter their homecoming plans because of the pandemic. The school district announced this week that homecoming dances will be postponed because due to the pandemic. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Our goal all along has been not only to open schools but to keep them open and allow our students to experience everything we have to offer,” said Bob Mosier, the chief communications officer for the school district. “Our high school principals met with student leaders and provided feedback to Dr. Arlotto that reflected the feeling that in light of the risks posed by the ongoing pandemic, postponing the dance while still allowing many of the other festivities to continue was prudent and best comported with our goal to keep schools open all year. We are hopeful we can hold these dances in the not-to-distant future.” “It’s really unfortunate because I feel like overall it’s going to end up getting canceled,” said Paige Davis, a student in the county. During a school board meeting Wednesday night, a member said a petition at an area high school in support of holding the dances, received thousands of signatures. A motion to move dances outdoors also failed in that same meeting. “Safety has to be number one,” said board member Robert Silkworth. “A homecoming in a basketball season or a lacrosse season, it’s not the same it’s just not the same, but that’s where we are. We are in times when some of our traditions are not going to be the same.” Melissa Ellis, another board member who supported the measure to move dances outdoors said “I agree with Mr. Silkworth that a dance later in the year is not homecoming. It’s not how it’s going to feel, it’s not how it’s going to be perceived by the students.” Baltimore County decided to cancel homecoming dances and indoor pep rallies this year. Baltimore City Public School officials said the district hasn’t made a decision yet.                   In Carroll County, school officials say homecoming dances will resume this fall and the dances will be outdoors. According to Carey Gaddis, the communications officer for Carroll County public schools, “because it is outside, students will not have to wear masks.”                   READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Harford and Howard Counties will have homecoming dances with efforts to prevent the virus from spreading. A statement from a Harford County official said “Homecoming dances are planned at each of our Harford County high schools with mitigation strategies in place.” Officials in Howard County released the following statement: “Homecoming dances will be held completely outdoors at several schools, utilizing stadiums or other spaces at the schools such as parking lot areas. For the schools that are planning to use indoor space for the dance due to size/site limitations, there will be designated outside areas also available. All schools will hold outdoor pep rallies. All school system procedures requiring masking will be in place for any activities held indoors. With dances being postponed in Anne Arundel County there are now concerns about equity if there are private parties. “There will be private events and some kids will get to be a part of that and others won’t,” said board member Joanna Tobin. Tobin did not support the motion that attempted to move dances outdoors. Tobin told WJZ that she believes the decision to move dances outdoors should have been made by the superintendent of schools. “Homecoming this fall will happen for some of our fortunate students whose parents decide to put together a private event and they will dress up and they will have pictures and it’s going to be during homecoming week,” said Ellis. Other homecoming activities will take place in Anne Arundel County and that’s why some students are wondering why the dances had to be postponed.

The landmark sanctuary said in a statement that the four windows will tell “a new and more complete” story of the nation’s racial history. Poet Elizabeth Alexander will write a poem to be inscribed in stone tablets alongside the windows, overlaying older ones that venerated the lives of Confederate soldiers. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The project is expected to be completed by 2023. The windows will replace a set  that honored two Confederate generals, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, with saint-like reverence and had included a Confederate flag. The cathedral removed them in 2017, prompted by a larger national reckoning over Confederate imagery and white supremacy in the wake of deadly right-wing attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia, that year and in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. The window openings have been covered with plywood since 2017. The setting is particularly significant in the massive neo-Gothic cathedral, which is filled with iconography depicting the American story in glass, stone and other media, with images ranging from presidents to famous cultural figures and state symbols. The cathedral, also the seat of the Episcopal Church’s presiding bishop and Diocese of Washington, regularly serves as the setting for ceremonies tied to major national events. In replacing the windows, the cathedral acknowledged a need to correct what it called a “false narrative of what America once was.” The old windows “were a barrier to our mission and impediment to worship in this place, and they had no place being in sacred space,” the Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, dean of the cathedral, said in a Thursday news conference. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the cathedral to not only create beautiful art but to stake a claim about what and who we value,” he added. Marshall, who made his first visit to the cathedral this week, said it’s too soon to say what the new windows will look like. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It was really important for me to come here and really get a sense of what the place is, what’s already here, what the mission they’ve tried to accomplish is, and then how I might be able to fit whatever it is the cathedral needs in order to fulfill its ambition for these windows … into that space,” he said at the news conference. He noted that the cathedral set a “monumental” goal of having the windows depict the pain as well as the dignity of “the African-American struggle for justice and equality.” “This is something that’s actually going to take a lot of time, because history itself, as most people know, is a very complicated narrative,” he said. Hollerith called Marshall “one of the greatest artists of our time” and praised Alexander as “one of our nation’s most eloquent and compelling voices.” This will be Marshall’s first work in the stained-glass medium after a long and acclaimed career using a variety of media to create portraits and other works depicting Black life. Marshall was a MacArthur Fellow in 1997. Alexander, president of the Mellon Foundation, recited one of her poems at the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama and has published multiple books including Pulitzer Prize finalists. She said in a statement that she was honored to be part of the cathedral’s “effort to ensure that those who worship within its sanctuary know that it is truly a space for all people, and that the stories relayed through its sacred walls, windows and other iconography represent the truth of our nation.” The cathedral has loaned the Robert E. Lee window to the National Museum of African American History and Culture for a new exhibit, “Make Good the Promises: Reconstruction and Its Legacies.” The museum said the window represents the “myth-building and the nationwide intimidation of African Americans through the embrace of Confederate symbols.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

The answer might just mean the difference between life and death. And it did for two total strangers in Chicago who are now connected by a special gift of a donated kidney. They only met two months ago, but the bond between Lisa Segura and Julian Ortiz is more than just skin deep – to say the least. “She’s impacted the life of our children,” Ortiz’s wife, Claribel, told WBBM-TV. “They see her as a hero. She saved their daddy.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Julian Ortiz has battled an autoimmune disease for most of his life. Glomerulonephritis began attacking his body until the father of four could barely move. “It got bad enough that I couldn’t even get off the bed, my legs were so swollen,” he said. Two years ago, doctors told Ortiz he needed a kidney if he wanted to survive. “There were days that we lost hope,” said Claribel Ortiz. “I put a sign on our vehicle that says ‘our daddy needs a kidney. We did videos. We did flyers.” Segura saw one of those flyers at the Midway Baseball Association – the same place they both coach – but they’d never met. “I took a picture of it and I just applied,” she said. “I thought, what the heck? Why not.” And as fate would have it, she was a match. “It was the best call of our lives,” said Claribel Ortiz. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I just started crying,” Segura said. For Segura, giving up an organ was a no-brainer. “It was a pretty easy decision. I knew if I had a spare, I only needed one to live,” Segura said. “I can’t imagine my kids living without me, and I don’t want that for his kids or his family.” The kidney transplant was two weeks ago. But for Ortiz and Segura, the memory of seeing each other for the first time since surgery will last them a lifetime. “I was like, ‘Wow, there’s a piece of me literally in his body now,’” Segura said. “It was a surreal moment,” said Ortiz. “She practically gave me another chance at life – not only for myself, but for my kids and my wife. There’s nothing I can do to pay her back for that.” Nearly 100,000 people around the country are waiting, just like Julian Ortiz was, for their own match.

(CBS)  – As the delta variant of COVID-19 surges throughout the country, hospitals in northern Colorado are among those that are  at or near capacity in their ICUs . And now, for the first time since being released from the ICU, one of Larimer County’s sickest patients is sharing his story in hope of bringing greater awareness of the virus to those who doubted its severity.   (credit: CBS)   Tom Schneider, a Loveland, Colorado resident, admitted he was among the biggest skeptics of the severity of COVID-19 and the safety of getting a vaccination. Schneider, 51, said he originally elected to forgo the vaccine until further research and development was completed.   “I didn’t know anybody that has been in hospital, I didn’t know anybody that had had side effects from COVID,” Schneider told KCNC-TV’s Dillon Thomas. “I wasn’t pro-vax, I wasn’t anti-vax. I was going to wait and see which one does better.”   But in early August, Schneider started feeling sick, as did his fiancé. He tried to battle his illness with over-the-counter medications. However, the symptoms continued to worsen. He eventually, and reluctantly, decided to go to the hospital. But, when he arrived, doctors told him he needed to be admitted.   Schneider said he chose, against medical advice, to go back home. He said he was fearful of the decisions the medical staff told him he would have to make if his symptoms evolved to a state in which left incapacitated.   He went home. And the next thing he remembered was waking up in the hospital. “I felt good one day and 24 hours later was in the hospital, intubated for four weeks,” Schneider said.   Schneider had passed out in his home. His fiancé found him, called 911 and had him transported for treatment by ambulance at McKee Medical Center in Loveland. “I just crashed, no energy, couldn’t breathe. Lethargic,” Schneider explained. “I was way not prepared to face that at all.”   (credit: CBS)   Placed on a ventilator for a month, Schneider said he couldn’t help but to spend some of his waking moments reconsidering his decision to not be vaccinated. He said he believed the virus was real but thought battling it would be easier if he ever contracted it. “It’s like a Monopoly game. And I think a lot of people are playing from GO to GET OUT OF JAIL,” Schneider said. “I didn’t realize that there were three other sides to this game. Being ventilated, long-term life effects and death.”   Locked away in an ICU without ability to see or thoroughly communicate with his loved ones, Schneider couldn’t help but to compare his experience battling COVID-19 with that of his fiancé’s. Schneider said his fiancé felt ill for less than a week and was able to quickly return to work. Meanwhile, he lost his job and was stuck battling for his life in the hospital.   Schneider thought back on his time helping the Army Corps build the overflow hospital facility at the Larimer County Fair grounds just a year prior. He said he couldn’t help but to think about how he once downplayed the severity of the virus.   “I look back and go, ‘You’re an idiot. You’re an idiot,'” Schneider said.   Thanks to medical professionals with Banner Health and Columbine Health Systems, Schneider was able to get out of the hospital. He is now being cared for in a rehab facility near his home. He expects to go home in the coming week.   As a Christian, Schneider said he mistakenly believed he could place God’s protection ahead of the virus. However, in the end, he said he realized God’s protection came after contracting COVID-19.   “It was stupidity and arrogance on my part. I’m a Christian, and one of the lessons that I learned was I was expecting God to show up and keep COVID from me. But God had me at the hospital getting treatment,” Schneider said. “He had me there with the people who needed to take care of me.”   (credit: CBS)   He said he was thankful to both God and the medical professionals who helped him for giving him a second chance at life. Though once a skeptic of the COVID-19 vaccines, Schneider said he now plans to get his vaccination once he is healthy enough to do so.   Looking back on his comparison of Monopoly and the battle with COVID-19, he hoped sharing his story would encourage others to realize the “game” is harder to play than they may realize. “Now that I’ve lived it, 75% of the game is detrimental. I don’t like those odds,” Schneider said. “You could get this and you could be dead tomorrow.”                                 ", "sentiment": -0.00895238095238096, "subjectivity": 0.3446428571428571, "wordcount": 776}

Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell said there’s one player whose skill set can compare to Jackson’s. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Michael Vick is probably the closest thing,” Campbell said. Jackson is also close to the former Atlanta Falcons and Philadelphia Eagles quarterback in the NFL record books. In the win over the Chiefs, he ran for 100 yards for the ninth time in the regular season to pull within one of Vick’s league record. If Jackson accounts for three touchdowns for Baltimore (1-1) against Detroit (0-2) on Sunday to increase his total to 92, just Patrick Mahomes and Hall of Famer Dan Marino will be ahead of him for the most throwing and running scores by a quarterback through his first 40 games in the NFL. There’s a good chance Jackson will get himself or a teammate in the end zone with the ball at Ford Field, and not just because he’s facing the lowly Lions, who are giving up 38 points per game. The former Louisville star has thrown or run for a touchdown in 38 straight games, the longest active streak by 11 games and the fifth best in NFL history. “He’s unbelievable, man, he really is,” Detroit quarterback Jared Goff said. “I think seeing him grow as a passer has been the scariest part of it all.” Even though Jackson had not beaten Kansas City before Sunday night, he limited his celebration to 24 hours, as he would for any victory. “I didn’t get on a high horse or anything and be like, `We just won a championship,’ or something,” he said. “None of that has happened yet. We still have a long season ahead of us.” CORNER QUANDARY Detroit has lost two of its top cornerbacks to injury each of the first two weeks. Jeff Okudah, the No. 3 pick overall last year, had a season-ending Achilles tendon injury in the opening loss to San Francisco. Ifeatu Melifonwu, drafted in the third round this year, was put on injured reserve after leaving Monday night’s game at Green Bay with a thigh injury. That leaves the Lions with Amani Oruwariye, a fifth-round pick in 2019, and converted safety Bobby Price, who joined the team as an undrafted free agent last year. THAT’S TIGHT Baltimore will have faced three of the NFL’s best tight ends before October. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Detroit’s T.J. Hockenson, who is tied for the league lead with 16 catches, has a chance to be the first tight end in league history to catch eight-plus passes and have a touchdown reception in each of the first three games in a season. “They’ve got plenty of good players over there, but he’s the straw that stirs the drink,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. In Week 1, Darren Waller had 10 catches for 105 yards and a touchdown for Las Vegas in an overtime win over the Ravens. Travis Kelce had seven receptions for 109 yards and a sensational score for Kansas City against Baltimore on Sunday night. SOLID SO FAR Goff isn’t going to make anyone in Detroit forget about Matthew Stafford, but he is off to a solid start with the Lions. Goff has connected on 69% of his passes for 584 yards and five touchdowns. He did, however, throw a pivotal pick-six in the season-opening loss to San Francisco and fumbled a snap in a setback to the Packers. “I don’t know if we’re very proud about the results so far, but we’ve done some good things offensively,” Goff said. HOMECOMING Harbaugh was born about 55 miles from Detroit in Toledo, Ohio, and attended Ann Arbor Pioneer High School across the street from Michigan Stadium. His brother Jim, leads the Wolverines.

Current vaccinations and immunity from infection help prop this possibility. Still, he says, vaccination rates need to get “higher if we want to create a backstop against the kind of spread that we’ve seen this past summer.”   He pointed to  CDC data  showing 76.7% of adults having received at least one vaccine dose. “We really need to get to around 80% to 85% to have enough vaccination in the population that you start to see case rates decline and the velocity of spread start to slow,” Gottlieb said.   Though national daily cases are inching downward for over a week, the overall Delta-influenced wave isn’t done and cases still may spike — especially as colder weather approaches, and especially in regions like the Northeast that haven’t been as hard hit as other places, he said.   “I think we’re going to see infections start to pick up here (in the Northeast), as well, as kids go back to school, schools become sources of community transmission, and people start to go back to work and the weather gets cold,” Gottlieb said.   “I think we’re still going to have a lit of cases this winter. … It likes to spread in the cold weather,” he said.   He painted a picture of what living with Covid-19 could look like once the wave diminishes, if no other variant pierces immunity.   “This becomes a more persistent, endemic risk. So, you continue to have coronavirus spread, but not the same rates we’re seeing right now, and it settles into … more of a seasonal pattern, and basically becomes a second flu, (but) probably more pathogenic than the flu,” Gottlieb said.   “The challenge is that we already have a flu, and if we have Covid circulating alongside flu, the cumulative death and disease caused by those two pathogens is going to be too much for society to bear,” he said.   So society still will have to do things differently, especially in winter, he said. That includes improving indoor air quality and filtration, making offices less densely populated, and wearing masks at least voluntarily in public spaces.   “I think you’re going to see masks become much more culturally acceptable and used in parts of the country,” he said.   Coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations jumped after the early summer, as the highly contagious Delta variant became dominant, though cases and hospitalizations have recently dipped.   The country averaged more than 130,790 new Covid-19 cases each day over the past week as of Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s down from the summer 2021 peak average of 172,001 daily reached September 14, but still is more than 11 times what the figure was two and a half months ago.   More than 86,920 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals on Thursday — a number that has dropped in recent weeks, but is still significantly higher than early summer, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.   Across the country, nearly 80% of ICU beds are in use — more than a quarter of those taken up by Covid-19 patients, according to the  Department of Health and Human Services.   Pace of first vaccine doses is the slowest in two months   Despite the call from health care professionals for the public to get vaccinated, the current pace of people receiving a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine is the slowest in two months, according to CDC data.   Meanwhile, federal health officials are considering expanding the groups of people eligible for boosters. Last month, the CDC recommended an extra dose of Covid-19 vaccine for some immunocompromised people.   On Wednesday, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine booster for people 65 and older, people at high risk of severe disease and people whose jobs put them at risk of infection.   Vaccine advisers to the CDC will meet Thursday to act on the FDA’s decision. The CDC must give its stamp of approval for any booster doses to be officially given.   Some schools up preventative measures, others dial back   Another consideration in managing the virus is the return of children to in-person learning, which schools are handling differently.   Some schools have amped up Covid-19 preventative measures as more students have been infected across the country.   In South Carolina, the Charleston County School District began fully enforcing its mask mandate Wednesday — and as a result, a number of students were sent home for not complying, district spokesperson Andy Pruitt said.   Students who don’t come back to school adhering to the new policy will learn virtually until at least October 15, though they are welcome to return to the classroom wearing a mask, he said.   Elsewhere, precautions are being eased.   In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a revised rule for the school year under which parents can send asymptomatic children exposed to Covid-19 back to class.   The policy, which some educators opposed, recognizes that quarantining healthy students is “incredibly damaging” for students’ educational advancement and disruptive for families, he said.

The Chargers fell to the  Dallas Cowboys  on a 56-yard Greg Zuerlein field goal on the game’s last play. The Chiefs dropped one to the  Baltimore Ravens , after running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire fumbled on a late fourth-quarter drive to put the team in field goal position. Both teams fell to 1-1, with a tough AFC West rival next on the schedule. Games in Week 3 of the season are rarely of the must-win variety. But with both the Denver Broncos and Las Vegas Raiders still undefeated, the Chargers will arrive at Arrowhead to play a Chiefs team which, like themselves, will be looking to keep pace and correct early-season problems. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts The  Chargers’ pass rush , which includes Joey Bosa, struggled to pressure Dak Prescott, despite the makeshift offensive line protecting him. But the team’s 12 penalties for 99 yards and many other mistakes also kept them from a better outcome. “For the Chargers, what has been their issue the last couple of seasons especially last season?” asks NFL On CBS analyst Charles Davis. “Closing out ballgames, playing with leads and not finishing the deal. And I know it’s a brand new regime with Brandon Staley, the head coach, but a lot of the same players are still around. So they’ve got to find a way to get over the hump… They didn’t get that done with Dallas last week. To me, that’s the biggest thing they’re going to continue to work on and improve, and I fully expect them to be in playoff contention, as the season goes on.” The Chiefs’ defense struggled to stop — or even slow down — a Ravens ground attack that piled up 251 yards. “They remind me a lot of what we used to talk about with Indianapolis with Peyton Manning,” said Davis. “They have a defense built to play with a two-score lead, and Peyton often supplied that for their defense. Well, Kansas City had a two-score lead multiple times in the game against Baltimore and did not close it out. Despite some nice plays by Tyrann Mathieu early with the pick-six and another pick in the next series. But again, opportunities to close things out to shut people down. Didn’t get it done. I would be a little bit concerned if I were a Kansas City fan. What are they going to do defensively to get that part fixed and get it corrected? Now, it could be a one-game ‘aberration,’ because Lamar Jackson was sensational down the stretch. But it is something that bares watching, because they shouldn’t be in shootouts each and every week. That offense is tremendous, you shouldn’t be turning around every time and saying ‘okay, Mahomes, rescue us and get us out of here.’ They had two-score leads. They should be able to put that away.” The Chargers offense also has the weapons to put points on the board. Quarterback Justin Herbert has turned in two more solid performances this season that show continued progress from his 2020 Offensive Rookie of the Year campaign. Week 1 saw him pick apart the Washington Football Team for 337 yards and a touchdown. More than half of that yardage came from Keenan Allen and Mike Williams. In Week 2, he threw for 338 yards and another touchdown, with Allen and Williams once again leading the way. Herbert now has 10 300-yard games in his first two seasons, tying Dan Marino’s record. READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University “This kid has it all, running, throwing,” said Charles Davis. “I absolutely believe he’s on a trajectory to be one of the better quarterbacks of our generation. That would not shock me one bit.” He’ll have help from a talented core of playmakers that should have little problem moving the ball against a Chiefs defense that allowed about 500 yards of offense to the Ravens. Running back Austin Ekeler, a dual threat out of the backfield, produced a combined 115 yards against the Cowboys. The Chiefs, meanwhile, let the Ravens pile up 251 yards on the ground. Allen and Williams will once again be his primary targets through the air. There isn’t much more to be said about the Chiefs offense. Mahomes and his talented receivers continue to put up video game numbers on a weekly basis. Mahomes went 24-31 for 343 yards and three touchdowns against Baltimore. He similarly went 27-36 for 337 yards and three touchdowns against the Cleveland Browns in their opener. Wide receive Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce are both among the NFL’s top 10 in terms of receiving yards. The Chiefs seem to win a lot of their games close, just as the Chargers tend to lose a lot of their games close. That could be the recipe for an upset. “I just think they need a breakthrough game where it’s 20-17, and they find a way to win in late,” said Davis. “It was just two seasons ago they won 11 games and went to the playoffs. Last year was a disaster in close game. Tyrod Taylor getting hurt, Justin Herbert coming in, you name it. Again, Derwin James hurt in training camp. I can go on and on with that. I think a little bit of luck, and finding a way to win a close one against a good opponent will go a long way towards kind of shaking off some of the demons that they deal with.” MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts The Chargers play the Chiefs Sunday, September 26 @ 1:00 p.m. ET on CBS.

In 1964, CBS News followed Corbett Rachal and his wife, Sallye, a Black couple, as they were repeatedly denied a home in Bergen County, New Jersey, one of New York City’s most desirable suburbs. That happens to be where Dokoupil’s grandparents purchased a home a decade earlier. CBS News documented in rare hidden-camera footage the Rachals repeatedly being turned away by real estate agents because they were Black. Dokoupil spoke with the couple’s daughter Alicia on how that discrimination has affected her family and what he life looks like today. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured CBS Local’s Katie Johnston chatted with Dokoupil about the piece he did on this important topic for CBS Mornings, what he learned from his research and conversation and what conversations in the future could look like about reparations. “It turns out that there are years and years of research showing the typical white family has between 8-10 times the family wealth as the typical Black family,” said Dokoupil. “Then we started doing a couple of stories on why that is. The answer, other than the big answer of racism, is real estate. It occurred to me one day that my family probably benefited from some of these policies. That’s what led me to New Jersey and actually going to my grandfather’s home county. He raised my father and aunts and uncles and talking to people there about whether they knew what happened there or whether they knew there was awareness and if there was what should happen now.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Dokoupil’s personal connection to this story allowed him to tap into a much bigger story in the conversation happening in this country about reparations. “Really what both of these stories are about are the conversation about reparations,” said Dokoupil. “Sometimes it comes up politically and there is a study going on in Congress about whether we need to do something like reparations. This is money for the harm of slavery and the continued discrimination. Polls are against it nationally and you hear people politically say it is ancient history, so what these stories really demonstrate is that when it comes to who has and who has not and it’s not ancient history and it continues to this day. Alicia also doesn’t feel comfortable with the idea of a transfer of wealth, but on the other hand she does recognize that her family’s financial trajectory went on a different course because of what happened in Bergen County. It speaks to the overall discomfort I think Americans have with the idea of making good when it comes to who has what.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Watch Dokoupil, Gayle King and Nate Burleson each weekday morning on “CBS Mornings” from 7 a.m. – 9 a.m. EST on CBS.

The Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, and Washington Football team have all split their first two games, while the New York Giants remain winless. But there is also some reason for optimism among the four teams. The Cowboys have a fully healed Dak Prescott under center. The Eagles have exceeded expectations to open the season. Washington is getting by despite the underperformance of their normally dominant defense. And the Giants’ Daniel Jones is learning to minimize the miscues. Is that optimism is warranted? We may find more answers in the division’s three Week 3 matchups. The Giants draw a favorable matchup against the winless Atlanta Falcons. Washington faces a Buffalo Bills offense that seems to have shifted into high gear. And the Eagles and Cowboys look to pick up a win against a hated division foe. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts SportsLine ‘s  Larry Hartstein  breaks down NFC East matchups in Week 3. All times listed are Eastern. Atlanta Falcons @ New York Giants, Sunday, September 26, 1:00 p.m. After 0-2 starts, both the Falcons and Giants could already be in danger of missing the playoffs. History has shown that reaching the postseason is almost impossible after an 0-3 start. And that could mean a bit of desperation. The Giants are coming off a heartbreaking loss against Washington, a game they would have won if not for a key special teams mistake that gave the WFT another chance at a game-winning field goal. But Daniel Jones has played well against two tough defenses in his first two weeks. He threw for 249 yards and a touchdown and ran for 95 yards and another touchdown against Washington. “Daniel Jones played mistake-free,” Hartstein pointed out. “There were no turnovers in Washington. They should have won the game.” “We see how dynamic he can be running the ball and throwing the ball,” Hartstein continued, “if he can just avoid the turnovers, which he did last week. And I just think, with everything that went on this week, with Kenny Golladay getting upset, and there being talk about are there issues with the offensive coordinator, I think they get it together for this week.” The Golladay dustup notwithstanding, the Giants offense efficiently moved the ball in Washington. Jones connected with Sterling Shephard nine times for 94 yards. The pair hooked up for 7 receptions and a 113 yards the week before. All that’s missing is a reliable option out of the backfield, which Saquon Barkley many soon provide once again. The Falcons have the NFL’s worst defense in terms of points allowed. They’ve given up 80 total in two weeks. The offense hasn’t done enough either, though they were able to hang with the Buccaneers for three quarters last week. Ryan tossed two touchdown passes to go along with three interceptions. “Matt Ryan, even though he did lead the team back, he’s a statue at this point in his career,” according to Hartstein. “He is so immobile, he can’t move.” Washington Football Team @ Buffalo Bills, Sunday, September 26, 1:00 p.m. READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University While the WFT won on a last-second, second-chance field goal, the Bills beat the Miami Dolphins in impressive fashion. Buffalo knocked QB Tua Tagovailoa out of the game early and proceeded to roll over the Jacoby Brissett-led Dolphins, 35-0. But maybe the win wasn’t quite as it appeared. Josh Allen only threw for 179 yards, completing about half his passes. “If you look a little deeper, it wasn’t that dominant of a performance,” Hartstein pointed out. “And Josh Allen is not the same quarterback, at least so far this year, only completing 56 percent of his passes. You look at all the advanced metrics, and he’s really been a top-of-the-bottom-10 quarterback so far this season.” Washington comes into this matchup with Buffalo as a heavy underdog. The much-touted defense has been made to look mortal in the first two weeks. Justin Herbert threw for 337 yards in Week 1, and Daniel Jones threw for 249 yards in Week 2. While both young QBs felt pressure, it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game. The WFT offense has found another leader. Ryan Fitzpatrick’s injury in Week 1 opened the door for the return of Taylor Heinicke, who many remember from his inspired performance in the team’s Wild Card loss to the Buccaneers last season. “Taylor Heinicke, I mean that kid is really legit,” according to Hartstein. “I think he is a legitimate starter in this league, 34-46 for almost 350 guards. And there’s something about him, the players believe in him. So, yes, I think Buffalo wins. Yes, Buffalo might get up 10 or 14 points. But I think the backdoor will be open.” Philadelphia Eagles @ Dallas Cowboys, Monday, September 27, 8:15 p.m. The Cowboys are expected to take the NFC East this season, with the return of Dak Prescott under center. Prescott hasn’t shown any ill effects from the ankle injury that ended last season or the setbacks that limited his preseason. He opened the season passing for 403 yards and three TDs against the Bucs before coming back down to earth in a Week 2 win against over Los Angeles Chargers. To be fair, the reduced yardage was likely a function of a more balanced offensive attack, as the running game came to life. The Cowboys may have to rely on their running game again against the Eagles as the injuries begin to pile up. “Amari Cooper showing up on the injury report with the rib injury,” Hartstein noted. “They’re already without Michael Gallup. That’s going to leave CeeDee Lamb and Cedrick Wilson. I do think Cooper will play. But how many hits is he going to take, and is he then going to be forced to leave the game?” The Eagles have their own injury concerns, which could affect the Cowboys’ ability to run the ball. Defensive end  Brandon Graham  suffered an Achilles injury against the 49ers and is done for the year. On the other side of the ball, running back Miles Sanders has been limited in practice due to a chest injury. Sanders is averaging 4.6 yards on his 28 carries so far this season. And limited production from him would put more pressure on quarterback Jalen Hurts. The young quarterback has been the team’s top rusher so far, with 82 yards last week and 62 the week before. “The Eagles were dominant in game one against the Falcons,” said Hartstein. “And in game two they actually outplayed the 49ers, even though they lost 17-11. They averaged six yards per play, the Niners only 4.5 yards a play. They blew it on fourth down. But otherwise should have definitely covered that game. Instead, they didn’t cover or win. But I think they’ll keep it close in a division matchup.” MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts Which picks can you make with confidence, and which Super Bowl contender goes down hard?

(AP)  — Alejandro Villanueva’s military background gives him a unique perspective on life as an offensive tackle. It’s pretty intense. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “I think that offensive linemen are very dark people in a lot of ways,” Villanueva said Thursday. “I think it’s a position where when you close your eyes before the play, all sorts of bad things are happening, and you’re hoping that they don’t, because a lot of things are outside of your control. “It’s very similar to when I was jumping out of airplanes. … A system of shoelaces and plastic bags catches me up in the air and avoids sure death. Then you get these type of feelings that there’s not a lot of upside to jumping, not a lot of upside to playing tackle.” Villanueva, who was an active member of the U.S. Army before his NFL career, offered up that comparison after experiencing the highs and lows of the offensive line in his first two games this season. When his Baltimore Ravens lost at Las Vegas in their opener, he allowed two sacks and 10 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. The following weekend, he allowed none of either as the Ravens beat Kansas City. Villanueva has been under scrutiny in part because Baltimore’s offensive line hasn’t completely come together as planned. The Ravens signed him away from rival Pittsburgh this past offseason. Then Baltimore traded left tackle Orlando Brown to the Chiefs for draft picks. The thinking was that Ronnie Stanley, whose 2020 season ended early because of an ankle injury, would be back—and he did start the opener at left tackle, with Villanueva on the right. But that was a rough game for the line as a whole, and Stanley didn’t play the following weekend. Villanueva moved from the right side to the left. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I just think he’s getting more comfortable with what we’re doing, how we’re doing it and whatnot,” offensive coordinator Greg Roman said. “The crowd noise had a little factor for him in that first game, but I really think as I watch, he’s really getting more comfortable with things. I think he looked at that first game and just said, ‘That’s not going to happen again.’ So, that’s a credit to him.” Lamar Jackson was sacked three times against the Raiders but only once against the Chiefs, and the Baltimore offensive line has blocked well enough for the team to reach its usual spot atop the NFL in rushing. For a player who is still new to the Ravens, this has been an eventful start for Villanueva. “It’s not just myself learning about him, I hope a lot of people did. He took the first game seriously. A lot of people doubted him (and) were saying all type of stuff about him,” Jackson said. “He moved from right tackle in the first game to left tackle to protect my blind side, and he aced it. He did a great job.” That kind of support means a lot to Villanueva, who, although he compared playing tackle to jumping out of a plane, is plenty capable of looking on the bright side of things. “It’s relying on the people in the building that are going to support you — coaches, players — and try to do the best with the next snap,” he said. “That’s the only thing that matters. There’s always the next snap.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It’s important that travelers must understand that marijuana possession remains a federal offense, and that travelers must clear a Customs and Border Protection inspection station upon arriving and departing the United States, so it’s probably a very wise decision for them to leave their marijuana at home or back on vacation,” said Adam Rottman, Customs and Border Protection’s Area Port Director for the Area Port of Baltimore. “Unfortunately, that message isn’t getting through.” Officers seized $80,388 in unreported currency from five travelers during between Aug. 16 and Sept. 8, the agency said.

(AP)  — Maryland coach Michael Locksley watched his team play mostly clean football through its first two games. Then the Terrapins made things difficult for themselves in last week’s victory at Illinois. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “If there’s anything I’ve been the most proud of—up until this past game—was we hadn’t turned it over, and we hadn’t had many penalties,” Locksley said. “To me, to be a good offense, it starts with not beating yourself first.” Maryland will try to recapture that mistake-free groove Saturday when the unbeaten Terps host Kent State in their final nonconference game of the regular season. After this weekend, Maryland’s next two games are against Iowa and Ohio State—two teams that can punish the types of errors the Terrapins made last week. Maryland (3-0) won its opener against West Virginia in large part because it forced four turnovers. The following game against Howard was a blowout. Then the Terps fumbled twice in the second half against Illinois. Maryland also had a touchdown negated because of a penalty. The Terrapins prevailed 20-17 because quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa and his receivers were able to execute under pressure, but there’s plenty of room for improvement this weekend. Kent State (1-2) has already faced some difficult tests. The Golden Flashes lost to Texas A&M and Iowa by a combined score of 71-17, although their deficit was in single digits at halftime of each of those games. Kent State coach Sean Lewis sounded similar to Locksley when he talked about the importance of avoiding miscues. “Fundamentals and ball security, as boring as that is. It’s like a chocolate milkshake — it works,” Lewis said. “When done right, it’s done right. So take care of the football, and let’s have great technique and fundamentals. No one needs to put their Superman cape on.” NEAR THE TOP Tagovailoa is averaging 319 yards passing per game, the second-best mark in the Big Ten. He’s completed 75.5% of his passes, with seven touchdowns and no interceptions. Tagovailoa has 956 yards passing, the most by a Maryland player through the first three games of the season since Scott Milanovich had 1,109 in 1993. AT THE TOP READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Maryland’s Dontay Demus leads the league with 113 yards receiving per game. Teammate Rakim Jarrett is averaging 86 and ranks fifth. PLENTY OF OPTIONS While Maryland has a deep receiving corps, Kent State leans on its running game, which averaged 283 yards last year. The Golden Flashes ran for 226 yards against Texas A&M. Running backs Marquez Cooper and Xavier Williams and quarterback Dustin Crum have all run for over 100 yards on the season. Kent State is averaging 266 yards rushing a game in 2021 and 5.4 yards per carry. IN THE BACKFIELD Maryland’s Sam Okuayinonu has four sacks through the first three games. As a team, the Terrapins have 11, including six against Illinois. The Terps have been mostly strong defensively over the past two games, although Illinois did go 8 of 17 on third down. “We didn’t get off the field on third down, which I think resulted in them getting 27 extra plays,” Locksley said. STRONG START A victory this weekend would give Maryland its first 4-0 start since 2016. “It’s handling adversity. I feel like this team has been able to so far,” receiver Jeshaun Jones said. “We have to keep building, to work on that, because we are going to be in more adverse situations.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

Between September and February, the Department of Public Works plans to deliver 190,000 rolling, lidded, 65-gallon recycling carts to eligible homes in the city, free of charge. Any home that has garbage services provided by Baltimore is eligible to receive a cart. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The $9.5 million project consists of a $3 million total investment from The Recycling Partnership, which includes $1.65 million from the beverage industry, a plastic resin donation for recycling carts from Dow Packing & Specialty Plastics, and lidded rollout carts manufactured by Rehrig Pacific, as well as a $3 million investment from Closed Loop Partners’ Infrastructure Fund. The city will begin a recycling education campaign to inform the community about the new carts and what can and cannot be recycled. Approximately 40 million new pounds of recyclables per year, or an 80 percent increase in recyclables per household, could be generated by providing Baltimore households with recycling carts, according to an estimate from The Recycling Partnership and Closed Loop Partners. Baltimore is the eighth-largest city in the United States without universal cart recycling access, according to a DPW statement. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn In identifying options for improving solid waste diversion, the city’s Less Waste, Better Baltimore Plan said providing residents with a free recycling cart would be key. Before this, city residents had to provide their own carts during the weekly recycling collections. Using larger-capacity, lidded recycling carts will allow for safer and more efficient collection, reducing the amount of manual labor needed, helping to prevent injury to collection staff while providing residents with increased storage capacity for their recyclables at the same time, according to the DPW statement. Old recycling bins can be kept for storage or disposed of at a  Residential Drop Off Center. Those who receive a recycling cart, but don’t want it can opt-out by calling 311.

According to that bulletin, Marylanders are not required to provide proof of eligibility. It states, “Any Marylander who presents to a provider that they are eligible for an additional dose or a booster dose shall be allowed to self-attest to that eligibility. Providers shall follow CDC guidelines when developing their own procedures to allow for self-attestation of patient eligibility. However, providers shall not turn away any individual who self-attests to eligibility for an additional dose or booster dose. Failure of an individual to ‘show proof’ of eligibility shall not be a reason that a provider does not administer an additional or booster dose.” The decision to include higher-risk workers comes after some disagreement among government health officials. On Thursday, a panel of CDC advisers voted against boosters for frontline workers and others with higher risks of infection in their workplaces, but CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky disagreed. Her decision effectively cleared booster shots for people in “high-risk occupational and institutional settings” as well as other groups. Governor Hogan said the approval for the Pfizer boosters is long overdue. “We are encouraging providers to conduct outreach to previously vaccinated individuals. If you received your second Pfizer dose at least six months ago, you should strongly consider getting a booster shot,” he wrote in a statement.

Since August, people who are severely to moderately immunocompromised have been able to get the third shots. That group includes transplant recipients and others with severely weakened immune systems. Maryland has already administered 51,704 additional doses to those who are fully vaccinated. 1,754 people got their additional shots in the past 24 hours, according to the Maryland Department of Health. Still, state officials said the priority remains convincing the unvaccinated to get the shot. 86-year-old Jay Towson Smith is one of them. “I’m a little skeptical on the effect the vaccines will have on my medications and heart conditions,” he told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren. He said he would be more likely to get the vaccine if it was mandated for him. Here are the frontline workers and other types of employees who qualify for a booster shot, according to the FDA and CDC: READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Health care workers  Teachers  Day-care staff  Grocery workers  Emergency responders This means that grocery store workers, teachers, nurses and other workers who fall under these categories can now make an appointment at a pharmacy or another vaccine provider and get a third dose. Booster shots are free of charge, with no ID or insurance card required, said Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response coordinator in a Friday briefing. National pharmacies such as CVS Health and Walgreens say they are ready to start administering booster shots based on the CDC’s latest guidance. There are roughly 80,000 locations across the U.S., including more than 40,000 pharmacies, where people can get boosters, Zients said. CVS also said it will be ready to provide boosters at its pharmacies and select MinuteClinic locations starting Friday. “We have the experience and the infrastructure to play a leading role in administering booster shots to eligible populations,” Troyen A. Brennan, chief medical officer of CVS Health, said in a statement Friday. Patients are encouraged to schedule appointments to ensure access to the correct vaccine, a CVS spokesperson said. If the new rules outlining worker eligibility for boosters are broad, that’s by design, said Dr. William Moss, head of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It was left deliberately vague and ambiguous about who fits into the category of people who should get a booster dose because of their occupational setting,” Dr. Moss said. He doesn’t expect the FDA to offer more specifics on what kind of worker may now get a third shot. “I do not think this authorization will have that level of specificity.” Regulators are still reviewing a submission by Moderna, which sought permission last week for booster shots of its vaccine at 50 micrograms—half the dose of its first two shots. Johnson & Johnson has yet to announce an application for approval of a second dose for its vaccine, though federal health officials say they expect the submission soon. Meanwhile, research backed by the National Institutes of Health examining the safety and efficacy of so-called “mix-and-match” boosting has yet to release results. Regardless, federal health officials said the initial series of doses—two for Pfizer and Moderna, or one from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine—would still be sufficient everyone to be considered “fully vaccinated.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “FDA is working closely with Moderna and J&J to get and process their data as quickly as possible, with a goal of making booster recommendations for Moderna and J&J recipients in the coming weeks,” Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told reporters on Friday. “This is a high, high priority.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.09107535438417792, "subjectivity": 0.41157218190306416, "wordcount": 965}

Baltimore centerfielder Cedric Mullins became the first player in Orioles history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season and received a curtain call after he hit a three-run shot in the second—his first homer since Sept. 11.

Orioles rookie reliever Tyler Wells pitched the ninth and allowed a leadoff triple to DJ Peters before leaving with an undisclosed injury. Connor Greene (1-3) entered and allowed a sacrifice fly to Willie Calhoun that cut the lead to 5-4. Green then allowed two infield singles and a walk to load the bases before Garcia doubled. Nick Solak drove another run on a fielder’s choice off Eric Hanhold and the Rangers rounded out the scoring on a double steal that allowed Garcia to score. Josh Sborz (4-3) picked up the win and Joe Barlow earned his eighth save. Nathaniel Lowe hit a two-run shot in the first for the Rangers, who improved to 56-99 but are still likely headed for their first 100-loss season since 1973. This would be only the third time the Rangers reached triple-digit defeats since the franchise moved from Washington in 1972. Rangers center fielder Leody Taveras made a leaping catch over the wall to rob Pedro Severino of a two-run homer in the third. The left fielder Peters did the same to Pat Valaika in the fourth. Lowe gave the Rangers an early lead with a two-run shot in the first off Orioles rookie Alexander Wells. The Orioles took a 4-2 in the second on a fielder’s choice by Richie Martin, who beat a relay throw to first base, and a three-run homer by Mullins off Spencer Howard.

COVID put the kibosh on that in 2020 and organizers feel it’s still not safe enough to gather. But they’re celebrating art and Italian culture by commissioning a mural–a mural so stunning you have to see it for yourself. “Carlos is an international phenomenon,” said Cyd Wolf of the Madonnari Arts Festival. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Carlos is Carlos Alberto Garcia-Hernandez. Two weeks ago he flew in from Paris, where he just finished a mural at the French embassy. Now he’s transforming a wall on Stiles Street in Baltmore’s Little Italy, into a massive painting of Rome’s Trevi Fountain. Carlos loves painting in public. He’s a regular at Baltimore’s Madonnari Arts Festival and festivals around the world. “Oceanus, as you know, is the god of all water, the ocean, and he was a benign god in mythology–he didn’t take sides,” said Wolf. “And we think that’s where Baltimore should be.” “The symbolism of the Trevi Fountain is, when you’re leaving Italy, if you sit on it and toss a coin, it means you’re going to come back. And we always want to come back to our culture and our heritage,” said Lou Mazzulli. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Mazzulli, who owns the building, has been dreaming of this mural for 20 years. But Carlos is adding four birds, three orioles and a raven. “Of course, we’re in Baltimore, and I tried to do something very iconic that everybody can see and say, ‘Oh yeah, Baltimore.’ The Ravens, well, you know, you have the football team, but you have Edgar Allan Poe,” said Garcia-Hernandez. Using spray paint for the first time, he constantly consults his rendering, and is learning to deal with a brick surface. Painted with house paint, unlike the traditional Madonnari chalk art, this mural is created to last. “This is going to be here long after we’re not,” Wolf said with a laugh.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured And the answer to most questions these days: COVID is the driving force. “Everything is high. Nothing has gone down,” said Chris Jones of Baltimore. “Chicken, pork,” added a woman named Mildred who lives in Baltimore. “Boneless chicken breasts have gone up,” said Edward Brown of Baltimore. Said Robin Price of Baltimore: “Don’t try to buy chicken wings.” “Beef,” Jones added. “From eggs, right up to soup,” Mildred said. Those shoppers Friday outside the Howard Park Shop Rite have taken notice. “Everything has increased. Except for the paychecks.” Price said. Added Jones with a chuckle: “The only thing that hasn’t increased is Oodles and Noodles. That’s the only thing that’s stayed the same.” Grocery prices everywhere are skyrocketing the past year. Meat, eggs and fish, particularly, are on the rise. “They’ve changed a lot. They’re getting higher and higher,” Jones said.

Bacon was $23. It’s now $27,” Price said. Karyl Leggio, a finance professor in the Sellinger School of Business at Loyola University Maryland, agreed prices are rising. “When I look at the cost of meat and poultry going up 4.4 percent last year, that’s a lot. That’s a big increase in one year,” she said. Some products are not even getting to stores, Leggio said. “Pretty much anything produced overseas. We’ve had a terrible time with supply chains,” she said. The economy is pretty good in spite of COVID, and we’re not likely to go back to pre-pandemic grocery prices. “The supply chain is broken by the fact factories are closed, certainly. It’s broken by the transportation issue. But, it’s also broken by the excess demand,” Leggio said. Demand, Leggio said, is the biggest impact on increased prices. COVID has changed people’s behavior, and more people are cooking. When asked when there might be relief, Leggio said with a laugh: “When will we see no more COVID?” Shoppers at the Shop Rite said much the same thing. “COVID is worldwide, so it’s affected everything,” Brown said. Said Jones: “I would usually cook. Nope. Everybody’s gonna have to bring a dish now. I can’t afford it.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Leggio said it’s probably a good idea to get a jump on holiday shopping because the same challenges we’re seeing in grocery stores, we’re seeing across retail.

The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .11% to 4.39%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 23 to 749. Of those hospitalized, 563 remain in acute care and 186 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 526,690 total confirmed cases and 10,140 deaths. There are 3,872,477 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,857,205 doses. Of those, 3,930,125 are first doses with 5,557 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,572,465 second doses, 6,134 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 300,012 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 399 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state has administered 54,603 additional vaccine doses, 2,899 in the last day. The state reported 83.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Chances are you’ve noticed that pumpkin spice has become so popular over the years that you’re likely to find it just about everywhere this fall, from scented candles to your cup of coffee. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured But did you know there’s a science behind the popularity of this scent and flavor? Researchers say it has to do with your sense of smell and, of course, a healthy dose of nostalgia. “It is associated with lots of positive memories that we probably have from growing up and family Thanksgivings and other kinds of fall seasonal stuff,” Johns Hopkins University doctoral candidate Sarah Cormiea said. Researchers tell WJZ the scents of those spices — cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger — trigger warm feelings for the fall season that people tend to find comforting and irresistible. “Smell has that special access to our memories like that and the fact that we get bombarded with pumpkin spice this time of year, it really starts to lock in those associations and keep those vivid connections going for us,” said Jason Fischer, assistant professor of psychological and brain services at Johns Hopkins University. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The allure of pumpkin spice isn’t lost on coffee shops, whether they’re mom-and-pop shops or chains with locations across the country. There’s such a high demand for the flavor, Dunkin’ rolled out its pumpkin spice-flavored items last month, which is earlier than the company has launched them in years past. “Everyone just loves and looks forward to pumpkin everything,” Colleen Krygiel, a field marketing manager for Dunkin’, told WJZ. But you don’t have to take the experts’ word for it. Just ask some of the people who clamor for pumpkin spice in their lives. “It tastes like happiness, happiness and memories and good vibes,” resident Dominic Williams said.

In Baltimore City, public school leaders have a plan to help those students who have fallen behind get back on track. Baltimore City Public Schools said its plan to help students includes personalized learning plans which look at the academic performance for each of their 77,800 students. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “We will look at literacy, we will look at math, we may look at some of our other core content areas in the secondary area to really build a picture of students so that we know where their strengths are and where the gaps are that we need to hone in on,” said Joan Dabrowski, the chief academic officer for Baltimore City Public schools. The district said the extensive plan also seeks to gather details from students and their family about students’ personal needs. School officials also said there will also be more tutoring options and every school will now have a tutoring partner. According to a  report  from state education officials earlier this year, failure rates in most of Maryland’s public schools doubled or tripled in their second semester. “I think it’s tough and it’s been a very difficult process for parents all over the place,” said Sydnee Distance, who has two children in Baltimore City public schools. Distance said it was a challenge to juggle her work while her children learned online, but both her son and daughter did well during online learning. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I haven’t been really concerned about learning loss because whatever I feel like they’re not getting, I supplement at home,” says Distance. Members of Baltimore City Council received a presentation on the school system’s plan to help students who have fallen behind academically. WJZ Reporter Ava-joye Burnett asked Councilman John Bullock, “Are you satisfied with the plan of action that they laid out?” “One of the things that I was pleased with is when they mention not necessarily remediation but acceleration, trying to get our young people the skills and the ability to be able to be at grade level,” said Councilman Bullock. “We will see. I’m confident at this point in terms of the answers, but we have to keep our eyes on the ball.” There was a public hearing segment during the virtual meeting where two public speakers voiced their dissatisfaction with the CEO of Schools, Dr. Sonja Santelises. One person was concerned that enough virtual learning options are not being provided. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government While acknowledging that the district has more work to do, Distance commended leaders for their plans to help struggling students. “I’m glad that they number one recognize that this is a problem and are trying to make changes where they can address the problem and help these children,” said Distance.

Saturday’s GoVax Clinic in west Baltimore provided both COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots for those eligible. The Rev. Dr. Greta Willis, the clinic’s organizer, stressed the importance of continuing to reach those who have not been vaccinated yet, especially in underserved neighborhoods. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured This is the third time Sarah Matthews has rolled up her sleeve. She got a booster shot Saturday. “I believe in science, I know it works,” she said. “I’m just encouraging the African American seniors to come out and get the booster. It’s no problem.” Maryland authorized Pfizer booster shots Friday, following approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for everyone 65 and older, adults with certain underlying conditions, adults in congregate living facilities and people who are at increased risk due to their job. Pfizer officials announced that its COVID-19 vaccine is both safe and effective in children ages 5 to 11. They said they plan to submit their data to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the month for review, and shots for children could be available as early as the end of October. “We need to protect ourselves, and this is the only way that we can assure that we’re going to be safe,” Matthews said. That is why Willis hosted the clinic — to promote a healthy environment and reach those who are still unvaccinated. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “One arm, one shot, equals champions over COVID,” she said. Saturday, more than 1,500 new COVID-19 cases and six deaths were reported. The statewide positivity rate is now up slightly at 4.39  percent. Trashawn Mackey just got her first dose of the vaccine after months of hesitation. “Well, I debated about the shot for a very long time so. But, I just finally decided to get it,” she said. “It’s like the ‘he said, she said’ talk that, that’s why people are trying not to get a shot or they’re just listening to stuff that they hear. but the shot is to better your health.” Now, she said she hopes to encourage others in the community to do the same. “It’s nothing hard, just go get the shot, so that way, we can all survive and see each other the next day,” Mackey said. As of Saturday, more than 3.8 million eligible Marylanders are fully vaccinated, and about 83 percent of all adults in the state have received at least one shot.

(WJZ) —  A school bus driver shortage is affecting states across the country including Maryland. In response, Gov.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Saturday, the MVA hosted Bus Drivers’ Day, a day where applicants could take their Commercial Drivers’ License test in a streamlined process in hopes of getting them behind the wheel of a school bus as quickly as possible. Cassidy McMenamin comes from a long line of bus drivers. “My grandmother is a bus driver. My aunt is a bus driver. My sisters are bus attendants. My grandfather was a bus driver,” McMenamin said. She took advantage of Bus Drivers’ Day to become a school bus driver herself. “You work with kids, you get to see their smiling faces every day,” McMenamin said. “You make a difference in their lives. “ The MVA opened on a Saturday so potential drivers could take their driving test and obtain the necessary credentials. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Governor Hogan wanted to do something here in Maryland to address it specifically,” said Chrissy Nizer, MVA administrator, “Obviously our school children are our most precious cargo. We want to make sure they don’t have challenges getting from school and that they are safe in doing so. So anything we can do at MVA to facilitate that process, we want to make it as easy as we possibly can.” The test itself hasn’t changed. They just made it easier to schedule appointments. “The standards are set by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, but here in Maryland what we can do is make that as efficient as possible,” Nizer said. Applicants are responsible for preparing for the test, which is exactly what McMenamin did as she takes one step closer to joining the family business. “It’s one of the best jobs in the world you can have,” McMenamin said. To become a school bus driver you can apply through the various county school websites. A commercial driver’s license is required, and some school systems are offering training. Anyone who missed today’s event but is interested in becoming a bus driver, email  schoolbus@mdot.maryland.gov  to schedule an appointment. Applicants are asked to include their phone number, driver’s license number, preferred time and location to assist with scheduling. They also should study the  CDL Manual.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The game was scoreless in the seventh when the 105-loss Orioles broke through against Texas starter Jordan Lyles (9-13). Trey Mancini walked and scored on Pat Valaika’s double, and Gutierrez followed with his second homer of the season. Lyles, who is pitching for his sixth team since debuting in 2011, allowed three runs and seven hits with four strikeouts and one walk over 6 2/3 innings. Trevino pulled the Rangers to 3-1 with a leadoff homer in the eighth off Brooks Kriske (2-1). Dylan Tate allowed a solo homer to Lowe in the ninth but still picked up his third save. Baltimore’s Austin Hays doubled in the ninth and extended his hitting streak to 11 games. The Rangers continued to play solid defense. This time, center fielder Leody Taveras threw out Gutierrez trying to score on Ryan Mountcastle’s flyball. The previous night, Taveras made a leaping catch over the wall to rob Pedro Severino of a two-run homer. Orioles right-hander Chris Ellis ​​had his start pushed back from Tuesday due to arm fatigue.

Justin Tucker kicked an NFL record 66-yard field goal as the game clock ran out in Sunday’s game in Detroit to lift the Ravens past the Lions for a 19-17 victory. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The ball sailed through the air, bouncing off the crossbar and then up and over to seal the win, bringing Baltimore to a 2-1 record on the young season. Tucker’s boot broke the previous 64-yard record set by Matt Prater in Denver in 2013. It was redemption for the Ravens’ kicker, who missed a 49-yard attempt in the first quarter.  Tucker finished four of five and added a PAT to lead the team in scoring with 13 points. The game-winning field goal was a spectacular finish to a so-so performance from Baltimore, which struggled to find pay dirt and keep the Lions off the scoreboard. What looked like a cake walk on paper was anything but for the Ravens, who were heavily favored coming into Sunday’s game. It wasn’t for lack of effort from quarterback Lamar Jackson, who completed 16 of 31 passes for 287 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He added 58 yards on seven carries. Despite carrying a 13-0 lead early in the third quarter, the Ravens couldn’t keep the Lions from roaring back with a pair of touchdowns from running backs D’Andre Swift and Jamaal Williams in the third and fourth quarters. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn It looked like Jackson might have cost the Ravens the game when he threw a pick with a little more than five minutes remaining and Baltimore clinging to a 16-14 lead. The Lions marched down the field, taking a 17-16 lead on a 35-yard Ryan Santoso field goal. Jackson was sacked for a three-yard loss when Baltimore got the ball back at its 25-yard line with 1:04 left on the clock. He couldn’t connect with Devin Duvernay on the next play and then took another sack, this one for a six-yard loss. But with the clock winding down and the game on the line, Jackson hooked up with Sammy Watkins for a 36-yard gain. He spiked the ball to stop the clock with seven seconds to go. After Jackson threw the ball away on the next down, the Ravens brought out Tucker and the field goal unit for an unlikely try at a game-winning field goal from 66 yards out. And the rest, as they say, is history. Jackson didn’t get much help when it mattered from wideout Marquise Brown, who had three catches on seven targets for 53 yards despite dropping multiple passes throughout the game.  The Ravens’ most reliable receiving threat was tight end Mark Andrews, who had five catches for 109 yards.  Watkins reeled in four catches for 68 yards, and  Duvernay caught two passes for 22 receiving yards and the Ravens’ lone touchdown.

I mean we already do flu shots yearly so at this point, if booster shots or covid shots, vaccines is going to be an annual thing, then that’s just what it’s going to be,” said Syeda Saibat Popoola-Sampson, parent. “One of the key elements of patrolling variants is to have high levels of vaccination,” said Thierman.

(AP)  — With more than 40 million doses of coronavirus vaccines available, U.S. health authorities said they’re confident there will be enough for both qualified older Americans seeking booster shots and the young children for whom initial vaccines are expected to be approved in the not-too-distant future. The spike in demand — expected following last week’s federal recommendation on booster shots — would be the first significant jump in months. More than 70 million Americans remain unvaccinated despite the enticement of lottery prizes, free food or gifts and pleas from exhausted health care workers as the average number of deaths per day climbed to more than 1,900 in recent weeks. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Federal and state health authorities said current supply and steady production of more doses can easily accommodate those seeking boosters or initial vaccination, avoiding a repeat of the frustratingly slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines across the country early this year. “I hope that we have the level of interest in the booster … that we need more vaccines,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday. “That’s simply not where we are today. We have plenty of vaccines.” Robust supply in the U.S enabled President Joe Biden this week to promise an additional 500 million of Pfizer’s COVID-19 shots to share with the world, doubling the United States’ global contribution. Aid groups and health organizations have pushed the U.S. and other countries to improve vaccine access in countries where even the most vulnerable people haven’t had a shot. Among the challenges states face is not ordering too many doses and letting them go to waste. Several states with low vaccination rates, including Idaho and Kansas, have reported throwing away thousands of expired doses or are struggling to use vaccines nearing expiration this fall. While most vaccines can stay on the shelf unopened for months, once a vial is opened the clock starts ticking. Vaccines are only usable for six to 12 hours, depending on the manufacturer, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Moderna vaccines come in vials containing 11 to 15 doses. Pfizer vials contain up to six doses and Johnson & Johnson vials five doses. “We are going to see more doses that go unused over time,” said Wisconsin’s health secretary, Karen Timberlake. “They come in multidose files. They don’t come in nice, tidy individual single-serving packages.” State health officials said they have tried to request only what health care providers and pharmacies expect to need from the federal supply. Those numbers have dwindled since the vaccines became widely available in early spring. But U.S. officials — holding out hope that some of the unvaccinated will change their minds — are trying to keep enough vaccines in stock so all Americans can get them. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn That balancing act is tricky and can lead to consternation around the globe as the U.S. sits on unused vaccines while many countries in places such as Africa can’t get enough vaccines. “Somebody sitting in a country with few resources to access vaccines, seeing people in the U.S. able to walk into a pharmacy and get that vaccine and choosing not to, I’m sure that’s causing heartache,” said Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, which represents the public health agencies of all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, said officials anticipate that on-hand doses of COVID-19 vaccines and manufacturers’ ability to supply more will meet needs across the country. “I think states have tried to plan as if everybody’s going to be offered a booster,” he said, suggesting they will be overprepared for the more narrow recommendations issued by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California, for example, estimated earlier this month that it would need to administer an extra 63 million doses by the end of 2022 — if initial shots for children under 12 were approved and boosters were open to everyone. U.S. health officials late Thursday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine for all Americans 65 and older — along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs. California, with nearly 40 million residents, has the lowest transmission rate of any state and nearly 70% of eligible residents are fully vaccinated. That leaves nearly 12 million people not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated. Dr. Mark Ghaly, California’s health secretary, said the state will rely largely on pharmacies and primary care providers to give boosters to seniors while some large counties and health care groups will use mass vaccination sites. In Pennsylvania, more than 67% of residents older than 18 are fully vaccinated. Alison Beam, acting secretary of health, said health authorities now have “two missions”: Continuing to persuade people to get vaccinated and serving those eager to receive a booster or initial shots. “Pennsylvania is going to be prepared,” Beam said. “And we’re going to have the right level of vaccine and vaccinators to be able to meet that demand.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

But the virus still poses a great threat to more than 70 million eligible people who remain unvaccinated. “The most vulnerable are those unvaccinated,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The CDC on Friday approved a third shot of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine to an expanded group of Americans. “Starting today, if you are six months out from your last dose of the Pfizer vaccine, you are eligible for a booster if you fall into one of three high-risk groups,” US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said during a briefing. “Number one: You are 65 or older. Number two: You have a medical condition that puts you at high risk of severe illness with Covid and these conditions include obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and others. And Number three: You work or live in a setting where you are at high risk of exposure to Covid. This includes health care workers, teachers, those living in shelters or prisons and grocery store workers,” Murthy said. Boosters have not yet been endorsed for the two other vaccines offered in the US — those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Health officials are working to determine next steps for recipients of those vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration “is working with Moderna and J&J to get and process their data as quickly as possible with the goal of making booster recommendations for Moderna and J&J recipients in the coming weeks,” Murthy said. Walensky acknowledged that even with more Americans becoming eligible for Pfizer boosters, the country must ramp up initial vaccination numbers for the pandemic to subside. “I want to be clear: We will not boost our way out of this pandemic,” she said Friday. The US has fully vaccinated more than 55% of all residents as of Friday,  CDC data  shows, while 75% of the vaccine-eligible received at least one dose of inoculation. A recent CNN analysis showed the average rate of Covid-19 deaths in the 10 least vaccinated states was more than four times higher over the past week than the rate in the 10 most vaccinated states. CDC vaccine advisers had recommended that Pfizer booster shots should be made available for people over 65 and those with health risks — stopping short of expanding that threshold to include those who may be disproportionally exposed to the virus at their jobs. But Walensky moved to account for the occupational exposure group in her guidance. “Some people really voted … with enthusiasm to say our health care workers, our frontline workers, people who were vaccinated early, people who work in congregate settings, in correctional facilities, grocery workers, really do merit the vaccine,” Walensky told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday. “The question wasn’t ‘yes or no,’ the question was ‘wait or do now,'” she added. Ultimately, the decision for boosters was about “providing rather than withholding access” and the need to protect society as a whole, Walensky said. Pfizer boosters are ready now The boosters are already available, with CVS Health announcing Friday that nearly 6,000 of its locations started offering appointments for a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Those who choose to go for the booster shot will be asked to “self-attest to their eligibility” outlined by public health officials, CVS said. They also must be recipients of Pfizer’s initial two doses. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn In California, Los Angeles County on Friday also began offering the booster shots to its residents who show proof of vaccination and affirm their eligibility, the county’s public health department said in a news release. Many schools closed due to Covid-19 outbreaks, study finds The headaches facing school officials and parents were underlined in a study released Friday on the impact so far of the pandemic on in-person learning. About 1,800 schools closed between August 1 and September 17 because Covid-19 cases were detected, which affected the education and well-being of 933,000 students, according to the  CDC study . Nearly 60,000 teachers in 44 states were also affected by closures, and the number of closures was highest in the South, the study found. Examining data from 8,700 districts nationwide, the CDC study found that “the largest number of districts with full remote learning (14) were in the West Census Region, followed by the South (11). Seven Midwest and two Northeast districts offered full remote learning.” The study noted that the timing of return to school may be a factor in school closures because the schools in the South returned earlier in August than other parts of the country– which typically start in late August or early September. Covid-19 outbreaks forced 300 Tennessee schools to close, the study shows, noting that was the most in the nation– followed by Georgia, Kentucky, Texas and South Carolina. The CDC recommends that people in schools wear masks even if they’re vaccinated as well as screen testing and physical distancing to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. New York prepares for hospital staffing shortages ahead of Monday vaccine deadline New York state is bracing for potential staffing shortages at hospitals and long-term care facilities ahead of a Monday deadline for workers there to get  at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine . The state health department issued the deadline in mid-August. As of Wednesday, 84% of all hospital employees in the state had been fully vaccinated, along with 81% of staff at all adult care facilities and 77% of all staff at nursing home facilities. Percentages for those who had at least one dose were not immediately available. On Saturday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a plan to address any staffing shortages that result from the deadline. She said she was prepared to sign an executive order, if necessary, that would allow health care professionals licensed in other states or countries, recent graduates, and retired professionals to practice in the state. Other options, Hochul said, include deployment of medically trained National Guard members and partnering with the federal government to deploy disaster medical assistance teams to assist.

(WJZ) —  Maryland reported 1,114 new COVID-19 cases and 15 new deaths, according to state health department data released Sunday morning. The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .18% to 4.22%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 5 to 754. Of those hospitalized, 569 remain in acute care and 185 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 527,804 total confirmed cases and 10,155 deaths. There are 3,877,040 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,868,834 doses. Of those, 3,933,935 are first doses with 3,810 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,576,656 second doses, 4,191 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 300,384 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 372 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state has administered 57,859 additional vaccine doses, 3256 in the last day. The state reported 83.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only approved for children 12 and older, which has stirred concern among health experts as cases in children increase, school years begin and the more transmissible Delta variant spreads. Nearly 26% of all Covid-19 cases nationwide are reported in children, according to recent data published by the  American Academy of Pediatrics.  And an average of 266 children were hospitalized with Covid-19 every day last week, according to Sunday’s data from the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC). Once the data from Pfizer/BioNTech is in, it will have to go through two committees, one for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and one for the CDC, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Johnathan Reiner said Sunday. If the data comes in this week, it would likely be in committee by the end of October, he added. And there is a lot of data for them to look at, he said. “This is a vaccine for children, so getting the dose right — in terms of efficacy and side effects — is crucial,” Reiner said. But even when a vaccine becomes available, a difficult task lies ahead in getting children vaccinated. Less than half of US adolescents are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data. In response, officials need to do a better job educating the public about the importance of vaccination for the health of their children and their families as a whole, Reiner said. “If you want kids in school, the best way to keep them in school is to keep them from getting Covid,” he said. Until vaccines are approved for younger children, the CDC has recommended mask wearing for students, teachers and visitors in schools from kindergarten through grade 12, along with improved ventilation, physical distancing and testing on a screening basis. “We know how to keep them safe,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CBS Sunday. “When we don’t use the proper mitigation, they’re more likely to have outbreaks.” Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said he encourages parents to vaccinate their children when they can. “This is a dangerous pathogen,” Gottlieb told CNN. “I wouldn’t be so cavalier about this virus, we know that this virus has long-term consequences in a lot of people who contract it, including children.” Current surge likely to die down by Thanksgiving, Gottlieb says Gottlieb predicted Sunday the current surge of coronavirus spread is likely to worsen across parts of the country and then die down by Thanksgiving. “I think you’ll see a wave of infection sweep across the Northeast as kids go back to school, the weather turns cold and people move indoors,” Gottlieb told CNN’s Pamela Brown. The virus won’t be gone, Gottlieb said, but hopefully it will reach more manageable levels — which he estimates to be about 20,000 cases per day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn According to the CDC, the current seven-day average for new cases in the US is more than 114,000 new cases a day. The decline in cases will likely come from most people attaining immunity to the virus, Gottlieb said. “Some people will get a vaccination; some will challenge their immunity by no choice but getting the infection,” Gottlieb explained. “People who choose to go unvaccinated, they’re going to be vulnerable to getting infected through this Delta wave.” As the US moves into flu season, Gottlieb said the demand for tests will pick up as people and their doctors try to determine if their flu-like symptoms are due to Covid-19 or influenza. “That’s why it’s so important to get diagnostic tests into the hands of consumers and doctors’ offices as well, things like where people can test in the home will make a difference between telling between Covid and other respiratory infections, especially as the flu picks up,” Gottlieb said. But even if Covid-19 cases do come down by Thanksgiving, health experts are bracing for a difficult winter ahead. It isn’t clear yet what this year’s flu season has in store, but it could add additional stress to an already pressed health care system. “Flu is still a killer, not as much as Covid-19, but between 12,000 and 50,000 Americans lose their lives every year from flu,”  said Dr. Peter Hotez , vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Last year’s flu numbers were low, which health expert say could mean that upcoming seasons may be worse, as there has been little accumulation of immunity. “We’re in for a whopper of a flu season at some point,” Gottlieb said Sunday. Recommending booster for frontline workers a ‘scientific close call,’ CDC director says On Friday, Walensky recommended a booster dose for adults at occupational risk of infection — in addition to those with underlying conditions and those over 65 — a decision she said was a “scientific close call.” “And because of that close call, and because of all of the evidence we reviewed at the FDA and the CDC, I thought it was appropriate for those people to be eligible for boosters,” Walensky told CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday. “So who are those people? People who live and work in high-risk settings. That includes people in homeless shelters, people in group homes, people in prisons. But, also, importantly, are people who work with vulnerable communities, so our health care workers, our teachers, our grocery workers, our public transportation employees,” Walensky said. Although the CDC’s vaccine advisers voted against recommending booster doses for people at high risk of infection because of their work or living conditions, Walensky went with the FDA’s authorization including those people. The recommendation is not currently intended for the wider population, but there’s little fear of causing dangerous side effects from adding that third dose, Walensky said. “We have an extraordinary amount of safety data,” she said.

Is there a difference between a baseball homer hit at Camden Yards or the Tropicana Dome in Tampa? Could be. So now back to Tucker’s 66 yarder. Ya see there is room for a weather discussion here.   I think the bottom line will be the game is the game and that is that. I’d like to hear from Justin himself on this one. Hopefully, we will.

Before we get into this particular episode though, we’re into season three now so how much does it mean to both of you to still have the support from the fans and still be going strong three seasons in? BG-  It’s incredible, man, we’re very very blessed that we found our audience very early and it has just grown since then. Now it’s culminating in this beautiful authentic Nigerian wedding that’s going to be colorful and beautiful and filled with joy and like nothing you’ve seen on a sitcom. It’s going to be a new launching point for us to go our next few years so it’s really, really exciting to be a part of this. FO-  I just feel like I lucked out in so many different ways. First of all, to be in America and have the opportunity that I do. This is the land of opportunity coming from Nigeria. I kind of had to escape for creative liberation. Here I am surrounded, still, by my culture and I’m just so happy that it’s resonated with so many people. I think that’s the brilliance of Chuck Lorre and our team. I feel like I have very little to do with this and I’m just grateful to be part of the ride. MW-  I’m sure you deserve more credit than you think! BG-  Absolutely, we love her humility. MW-  Now you mentioned we’re on the edge of this huge moment for both of your characters. How proud are you of the growth that those characters have had? FO-  Very proud, I’m so glad to let loose. BG-  It took Bob a minute to de-ice her heart but he finally got there. Abishola also offers a strength for Bob. I think that’s one of their great connectivity things. FO-  Yeah, I’m really proud that this season you’re going to see Abishola in a new light, a way you’ve never seen. It’s just beautiful even for me as an actor to just loosen it up a little bit. I made the choice to make her as she’s come across in the past couple of seasons but I’m always happy to show a different side of her. MW-  We have this traditional Nigerian wedding tonight, how much work went into making this as authentic as possible?

I don’t think this is going to be topped all year. I mean they were so authentic from from the dress to the way that the wedding is supposed to be performed; the week of festivities. They really nailed it. FO-  Yes, the art department and the crew, if they aren’t recognized for the amount of work that went into these episodes it’s going to really be a disservice. We see an assimilation blending American sitcom into the Nigerian space in a way we’ve never seen before. We actually literally drive past the house that I grew up in. That’s how authentic it is. We have a replica of of a real Nigerian market on set. We also showed that in season two, a little bit in season one and then we really dive into it in season three. The wedding decorations are exactly a replica of how you would see them in Nigeria. There is a particular way to decorate and they have that down to a tee. The wardrobe is also replicated down to the stitch in a way that we’ve never seen on American television before. This is a historic moment and I think folks don’t want to miss it. MW-  What an experience to have the actual house you grew up in be a part of this episode. You’re really blending your two homes… FO-  That’s pretty much the only home I ever had until I met Chuck Lorre and was able to afford another home; I’m serious. I left Nigeria, when I was when I was 18, I moved here and it was just never the same. It just means so much to me. I remember sitting on top of that house and looking out at a performance and just hoping and praying that one day I’ll just get a chance to be in the arts. Now here I am on American television and my character is driving right in front of that house; it’s so beautiful. MW-  That’s incredible. Unfortunately that’s all the time I have with you two today but thank you so much for the time. Congrats on the wedding and all the best! BG-  Thanks a lot man, take care. FO-  Thank you, Matt!

She plays Baby Shark in the hit Nickelodeon series “Baby Shark’s Big Show,” has done voice work in big shows like “BoJack Horseman” and “DuckTales” and now has a starring role in “My Little Pony: A New Generation” as Izzy Moonbow. It’s been seven years since Glenn first became a household name in Hollywood for her role in “Orange is the New Black” as Brook Soso. CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith recently caught up with the actor to discuss her latest voice acting work, why the Baby Shark series was such a hit in season one and what the lasting impact of “Orange is the New Black” is. The actor’s latest film “My Little Pony: A New Generation” is available to stream now on Netflix.

What I think is really cool is you don’t talk down to them. They’re not adults yet, so you can’t necessarily treat them like adults, but you can present really important, deeper concepts to them and have them understand and have them be communicated. If it’s a story, anyone can get into it. Anyone can have empathy for a character and understand why. I’m most mostly noticing the braveness and boldness of adults taking on certain concepts and presenting them to kids.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Glenn says her friends with kids are always texting her videos of their children watching “Baby Shark’s Big Show” on Nickelodeon. The series has already been renewed for a second season and Glenn enjoys how the show is targeted for young kids, but explores big concepts. The actor has always enjoyed work with a deeper meaning and that was certainly the case when she joined “Orange Is The New Black” in season two.

People were finally interested in prison reform and really understand that these are people. We pretend that they are out of sight and out of mind, but these are real people that are getting affected by the way they are being treated. It really did a lot.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .02% to 4.2%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 42 to 796. Of those hospitalized, 604 remain in acute care and 192 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 528,764 total confirmed cases and 10,166 deaths. There are 3,877,649 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,869,687 doses. Of those, 3,934,179 are first doses with 244 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,576,898 second doses, 242 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 300,751 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 367 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 57,859 additional or booster vaccine doses, none in the last day. The state reported 83.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

In total, the United States has recovered more than $1.6 million in proceeds of the fraudulent PPP loans as well as a 2018 Tesla Model 3 purchased with proceeds of the Cars Direct PPP loan.  If convicted, the United States will seek forfeiture of the seized property as well as the Upper Marlboro, Maryland property purchased with fraud proceeds.

Get Down, Lamar READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Would someone please let Lamar Jackson know it’s okay to slide every once in a while? Sure, Jackson’s elusiveness and speed are a major part of what makes him so exciting to watch. And his athleticism and toughness are unquestioned. But it’s hard not to cringe when you see him take an unnecessary hit at the end of a play because he stays on his feet or takes on would-be tacklers head-on. There’s no shame in ducking avoidable contact after you’ve picked up a first down. If nothing else, it’ll keep Jackson healthy and extend his career. The last thing Baltimore needs right now is another injury. Missed Opportunities READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Let’s face it, despite a thrilling finish Sunday, there’s no reason the game should have been that close in the first place. Granted, it was a road game for Baltimore, but the Ravens were big favorites to steamroll the winless and listless Detroit Lions. Perhaps the biggest reasons the game came down to the wire were Baltimore’s inability to finish drives (they were 1 for 10 on third-down conversions) and its receivers’ inability to haul in catchable passes. The biggest offender was Marquise Brown, who dropped three passes that would’ve likely ben touchdowns. He’ll look to redeem himself in Denver. Feed Mark Andrews Tight end Mark Andrews might be the Ravens’ top receiving threat. So, it’s a bit puzzling the team isn’t getting more milage out of him three games into the season. Andrews had five catches for 109 yards on a team-leading seven targets for his first 100-yard game of the year. Now the Ravens tight end doesn’t create the same matchup nightmares as Travis Kelce and Darren Waller, but Baltimore fans know how lethal the Jackson-Andrews connection can be when the two truly gel. If the Ravens are looking for an offensive spark moving forward, they should consider feeding their tight end. It Was Over When… MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government It was over when  Justin Tucker sunk an NFL-record 66-yard field goal as the game clock expired  to put Baltimore ahead of Detroit 19-17. The game-winning, record-setting kick added to what’s an already impressive resume for Tucker, who also led the Ravens in scoring Sunday with 13 points. The four-time Pro Bowl and All-Pro selection continues to reward the team and its fans for putting their faith in him in high-pressure situations. The only question is, what will the four-time All Pro and Pro Bowl selection do next? It’s safe to say his kicking will be key to the Ravens’ success this season.

The findings–including lobbying efforts, financial disclosures, conflicts of interest–were presented to Mayor Brandon Scott, the City Council and members of the public, the Ethics Board said. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The report was produced to demonstrate how the city is following its ethics law, which was modeled after the state’s ethics law and was put in place to “guard against improper influence or even the appearance of improper influence, and to ensure public trust in the government.” Among other things, the ethics panel is charged with investigating ethics complaints and handing down sanctions, training public officials and employees on ethics, offering guidance on ethical matters, and overseeing the financial disclosure and lobbyist reporting systems. To keep up with the times, the panel established a hotline and email address this year to manage ethical inquiries, complaints and other matters relating to ethics. Through that help desk feature, the board’s staff handled more than 1,500 requests, the majority (1,101) of which were questions about financial disclosures. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The board also issued five advisory opinions on a range of matters, including gifts to city officials, post-employment requirements for public officials and questions about secondary employment. Making up the largest piece of the ethics puzzle were financial disclosures, which public servants are required to make in certain situations. For example, if a public servant has a financial interest in business dealings with the city, or they’ve received a gift from someone who does business with the city, they would need to disclose that information. The ethics panel found the city’s public servants achieved 99-percent compliance in the 2021 filing season. Over 2,800 people filed disclosures, an 11-percent increase compared to 2020. The board fielded a total of 17 complaints in 2021, with seven falling outside the board’s authority. The rest of the complaints are  summarized in the panel’s annual report.

The latest iteration of the  NCIS  universe,  Hawaii  stars Vanessa Lachey as Jane Tennant, the first female agent in charge of the NCIS Pearl. CBS’ Matt Weiss caught up with Lachey to discuss her path to the show, what  Hawaii  hopes to accomplish and tonight’s BOOM-ing new episode. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW-  Hello Vanessa! Congrats on last week’s premiere. Now that we’re off and running how does it feel not only be a part of this show but being the head of the whole team? VL-  It’s an honor and I don’t take lightly. I’m excited, this is an evolving franchise and to be a part of it so incredible. They said they had trouble finding Jane Tennant during casting and I was actually on another CBS show, a comedy believe it or not. So talk about reversing the roles we got word on March 31st that comedy wasn’t moving forward and I ended up getting super sad and confused. Then I heard about  NCIS: Hawaii  and booked the job by mid April. I was surprised and my career took a complete left turn but I’m so glad things went the way they did. Now here we are and I’m living in Hawaii. MW-  Not the worst place to have your life turned upside down. VL-  Yeah, exactly. Maybe it’s just finally turned right side up! MW-  [Laughs] There you go! So we’re one episode in with very positive reviews which I’m sure it’s great to hear. For myself this definitely feels like  NCIS , but it’s fresh at the same time. VL-  Thank you! Yeah, it’s evolving the franchise to show more of a personal life and the vulnerabilities of the family and the characters. We try to stay true to what  NCIS  is but we also want to add some layers that set it apart. MW-  As Jane Tennant you are the first female agent to be in charge of NCIS Pearl. What does that mean to you to play a character like Jane and what are some of your favorite qualities about her? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn VL-  Oh gosh, well it’s an honor to play her. There are female in NCIS out there so I love this, you know starting to make it the norm. For qualities that I love, I love that she doesn’t take no for an answer. She will continue to strive for what she wants in a male dominated profession and at the same time, do it with grace. She’s a great mom too. She always, always has her kids in the front of her mind even when she’s at work. She’s leading 44 special agents but she’s always thinking about her kids and always puts them first. She has a love of country and she honors her country. At the same time at the end of the day, she’s a vulnerable woman who just wants to love. There’s a lot about her I love and that’s why I fell in love with this character. When I got the job I completely broke down because I said to myself, I can do this, I am her, I believe in her, I know what she stands for. I felt like this is me. MW-  Now we have episode two coming out tonight and I love the title. Episode two is simply called “Boom.” VL-  There are a lot of explosives, a lot. It’s going to keep you on your toes and the edge of your seat. We also introduced a new character, his name is Boom Boom. He’s my explosive guy and I think you’ll really dig him as well. We really knocked it out of the park with these episodes, we’re coming out of the gate strong. I hope everyone feels that way as well! MW-  Well we’re all excited to see what happens tonight and the rest of series moving forward. Congratulations again on the role and thank you so much for the time Vanessa! VL-  Thank you, Matt!

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland by the federal agency states that the unnamed female employee was fired a week after she complained about unfair wages and asked for a raise. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured According to the EEOC, the warehouse dispatcher learned in September 2020 that she was being paid less than her male counterpart, despite being with the company six months longer than him. Once she learned of the pay gap, she brought her concerns to human resources. “The EEOC charges that the director of human resources said he ‘would look into it,’ but instead abruptly fired her one week later, purportedly for making an inappropriate joke,” the agency said. When the employee mentioned that a coworker had only been written up for viewing pornography at his desk, she was told the two situations were different, according to the EEOC. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “The EEOC says that the real reason for the dispatcher’s termination was retaliation for her complaint about the compensation discrimination,” the agency said. Under federal law, it’s illegal for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and disability, among other factors. “Female workers in all industries deserve equal pay for equal work,” said Debra Lawrence, the Philadelphia regional attorney for the EEOC. “Workers have the right to ask about perceived pay discrimination without being fired as a result and that is why we filed this lawsuit.

On Monday, Cherry Hill’s principal sent students home with a letter that reads in part, “Last week we administered our second round of COVID test. Results of the testing confirmed six positive pools.” Families with children in the six pools were called over the weekend and if they don’t sign up for their kids to get tested at school this week, families are required to get their children tested on their own. “It should be a mandatory ten-day quarantine for everyone at this school,” said Takia Dixon, a parent.  Among those positive, a 12-year-old student is currently hospitalized from COVID-19. The Dixon family carpools regularly with the student. “And her mom contacted us and said she has it, and she was in your car around your children. You might wanna get your kids tested.

Baltimore City Public Schools told WJZ they are working to identify all close contacts and determine the impact on the affected classes but parents like James, whose daughter Sema’j is in fourth grade believes the entire school should go virtual. “This is not over with. So you should at least do virtual, let them stay home and do virtual on the computer,” Fortune added. Baltimore City Public Schools said they’re aware of the student who is currently hospitalized and they are hopeful for a swift and full recovery. But until then, Janae Stanley said she isn’t sending her daughter back to school. Ever since cases were announced at Cherry Hill Elementary Middle School, Stanley said she stopped sending her daughter, Aziyah, to school “I don’t think she’s safe,” Stanley added. She wanted the school to shut down and for the kids to learn virtually.

Alfred Chestnut spent 36 years behind bars for murder. Chestnut was exonerated in November 2019, but he remembers the exact moment he was arrested as a teen. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “I was basically in bed, like 1 o’clock in the morning, and I thought I was dreaming. Lights bright as this was in my face and all I saw was guns,” Chestnut recalls. Another man, Eric Simmons, had a similar experience in a totally separate case. Simmons and his brother, Kenneth McPherson, were convicted of murder back in May 1995. Simmons says he too remembers the moment when he and his brother were arrested. “When I woke up, there was a bunch of guns in my face, the same way, snatched out of the bed,” says Simmons, adding that his mother saw both of her sons taken away the same day. “She lost her only two sons for crimes they didn’t commit.” Simmons said his mother died before he and his brother were eventually released. Chestnut and Simmons are among 10 men from Baltimore who’ve been released from prison after the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office helped to prove that they were innocent and that the evidence used to lock them up was tainted. Anyone can contact the office if they believe they were wrongfully convicted. “You know that somebody finally heard your cries, somebody finally listening that didn’t listen for the last 25 years,” Simmons says. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Chestnut says the world felt different when he was released from prison in his 50s, compared to when he was incarcerated as a teenager. “When we walked out the door, I instantly looked up at the sky and I looked at the tall buildings and it seemed like the streets were much more smaller compared to when I was a kid,” Chestnut says. Chestnut, Andrew Stewart, and Ransom Watkins are known as the Harlem Park Three. The young men were wrongfully convicted of murder in 1983, when they were 16 years old. They were convicted of murdering their childhood friend Dewitt Duckett in the hallway of Harlem Park Middle School. While behind bars, Chestnut and Simmons studied the law, fought for and won their freedom. It’s a battle that lasted decades. “For those who may be in prison, that’s wrongly convicted, you can’t let go too soon. You can’t give up, you got to keep up a constant fight,” Simmons says. On Saturday, Oct. 2, there will be a town hall from 1-3 p.m. at the School of Social Work auditorium at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The event is expected to feature some of the exonerees.

The Delta is variant pushing up case numbers among the unvaccinated. President Biden is instituting  stronger efforts to encourage vaccines, as the rise in cases slows the economy’s improvement. Some segments of the population have yet to experience any real improvement. Unemployment still exceeds pre-pandemic levels, even with jobs widely available in certain sectors. The federal unemployment bonus ended on Labor Day. Millions of people remain short of food and behind on bills. A fourth stimulus check could help those still struggling to make ends meet. A few places, including California, have recognized that need for additional help and stepped up with additional payments. But will the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) come through with another stimulus check in 2021? That question has no a definitive answer yet. But plenty of clues point where things are heading. Economic Recovery For Some READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Relief payments were intended to ease COVID’s economic impact and support the economy in the process. The third round of relief payments started back in March, courtesy of the American Rescue Plan (ARP). Over the following months, about  169 million people  received up to $1,400 each. That accounts for nearly all of the $422 billion set aside. The ARP checks closely followed the $600 payments from January, which came nine months after the $1,200 payments from the pandemic’s early days. They seem to have worked, but have also helped many who didn’t actually need the money. In the second quarter of 2021, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of  6.5 percent , according to the advance estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. ( Supply shortages  may have prevented even faster growth.) That continues the torrid pace from the first quarter, which saw 6.4 percent growth. The  Conference Board  forecasts continued though slower growth through the rest of the year. The country’s  gross domestic product  (GDP), an estimate of economic activity across the U.S., has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. By that general measure, the economy has already recovered. Broad segments of the workforce have endured little economic hardship during the pandemic. Many jobs performed at a desk in an office are just as easily performed at a desk in someone’s home. And with fewer places to spend money during much of the pandemic, plus three stimulus checks, many Americans saved more than they might have otherwise. The personal saving rate ballooned to 33.7 percent in April of 2020 and has remained well above pre-pandemic levels ever since. In July of 2021, it sat at  9.6 percent , still above the 8.3 percent from February of 2020, the month before the pandemic started. On  Face the Nation  back in June, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan  estimated  that its customers had not spent 65-70 percent of their last two stimulus checks. That extra savings combined with pent-up demand has likely helped drive the broader economy during the rebound. The  housing market  has also surged, thanks to low interest rates and people stuck at home realizing the limitations of their living space. The National Association of Realtors recently reported that the national median sales price for an existing home hit $356,700 in August, up 14.9 percent from August of 2020. Much of that rise was helped along by houses priced above the median. Housing inventory decreased over July, and was down 13.4 percent year over year. And of the homes that sold in August, 87 percent were for sale for less than a month. The stock market continues to perform well too. The Dow Jones remains far above where it was at this time last year. It regularly sets new record highs, or at least approaches them. The market opened Tuesday morning at 34,747 as compared to 27,584 around this time a year ago. Concerns about the Delta variant and lagging vaccination rates in parts of the world still linger. COVID case numbers continue to rise, and mask mandates have come back into effect in many parts of the country, thanks to the Delta variant. But the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) full approval of the Pfizer vaccine, along with the approval of booster shots for those at risk or over 65 yeas old, has been good news for the market. Individual investors who saved their stimulus cash remain invested. Bigger investors continue to bet on a strong economic recovery in the months ahead. While certain experts foresee some of the strongest economic growth in decades, many are also worried about higher inflation. August projections indicate that prices will rise about  5.3 percent  in 2021. That’s compared to the 2.3 percent rate in 2019 and 1.7 percent rate in 2020. The latest data shows prices rising  5.3 percent  over the last 12 months. Should that rate persist for the rest of the year, it would be the highest in three decades. That possibility has become less likely of late. Prices moved up 0.3 percent in August, a slowdown from previous months. Core consumer prices — excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile — rose only 0.1 percent. Nevertheless, rising prices continue for many products that require semiconductors, including new cars, computers, and TVs. Price hikes and product shortages stem, in part, from the economy opening up all at once. Prices depressed by the pandemic have had to normalize. But companies couldn’t keep pace with a year’s worth of pent-up consumer demand. They also have had to revive and retool their supply chains in the midst of drastic changes in consumer demand patterns. And this has all happened as shipping issues and other constraints continue to slow production and delivery. COVID has altered how and what people consume. The way these changes continue to play out isn’t necessarily predictable. Companies, however, have had to guess where demand for their product will be when all the dust settles. Predicting the future is hard enough in a normal economy. It became much harder in an economy trying to move past a pandemic then forced to deal with a resurgence. Price changes and shortages across a whole range of products will likely continue to plague consumers in the short-term. But economists think they should improve with time. Consumer spending  is starting to slow, with the rate down to 0.3 percent in July, as compared to 1.1 percent in June. Demand for travel and leisure is starting to ease. The same goes for spending on various goods, resulting from all the shortages. New car purchases continue to be a drag, with semiconductor shortages still creating production and supply issues. Overall, goods spending remains above pre-pandemic levels, but could also be showing the effects  Delta variant  concerns. No Economic Recovery For Others The pandemic has further highlighted the growing imbalance across the broader economy. While many households have financially flourished during COVID, many others have fallen behind where they were in early 2020. Much of the gap depends on whether wage earners could work remotely during the shutdown or had public-facing jobs that required them to be on-site. Financial insecurity is still widespread, and the loss of a job and the loss of hours have been some of the main reasons over the course of the pandemic. Nine percent of American adults (approximately 18 million people) reported a  shortage of food  in their household over the previous week, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of U.S. Census survey data from late August. Approximately 15 percent of renters (10.7 million people) have fallen behind on their rent, including 22 percent of renters with children in their household. The federal  eviction moratorium , which has been extended until October 3, doesn’t forgive rent that is owed, it pushes the debt into the future. And  evictions continue  in some parts of the country regardless. Meanwhile, only a fraction of the $46 billion Congress allocated for rental assistance has actually made it to tenants and landlords. As of late August, over a quarter of American adults (60 million people) reported some difficulty keeping up with expenses in the prior week. Employment also remains below pre-pandemic levels. About  5.3 million  fewer workers are on payrolls than before the pandemic. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent in August, but job growth slowed dramatically. Forecasters expected roughly 750,000 new jobs last month, but employers only added about 235,000. (July saw about 1 million new jobs.) Many fear the rise of the Delta variant is hindering growth. Low-wage jobs made up the bulk of those lost during the pandemic, and while plenty of openings have returned, many remain unfilled. Approximately  351,000 people  initially applied for unemployment insurance in the week ending September 18. (A typical pre-pandemic week saw about 250,000 new unemployment applications.) The approximately 4.9 million people previously collecting PUA  lost benefits  on September 6, when the program ended. As of the week ending September 4, over 11 million workers were receiving some form of unemployment aid. Many jobless Americans have not received unemployment insurance and other government benefits, because of long waits, perceived ineligibility and other issues. Job growth still faces some headwinds, aside from the Delta variant. Some have argued that overly generous benefits made unemployment more attractive than working. But other considerations factor into one’s ability to work too. Remote schooling created childcare issues for many parents, and summer break didn’t necessarily change anything. The resumption of in-person learning, if it lasts, could free up some parents to return to work. The full vaccination rate is  55.3 percent  for the country. But state percentages range from 69.3 percent in Vermont to 40.4 percent in West Virginia. Many counties across the country have vaccination rates lower than that. The threat of COVID, particularly the now-dominant Delta variant, is still real in places. Many people are uncomfortable working in public around strangers. The number of people remaining unemployed because of  COVID concerns  in the first two weeks of August grew 30 percent to 3.1 million, according the Census. A gap between labor force skills and job requirements can make hiring more difficult, not to mention the rising standards of what workers will accept in a job. And then there’s the general friction that inevitably arises when an entire economy slams its foot on the gas. As before the pandemic, many who are willing to work cannot find jobs with the wages and benefits they need to survive. According to  Marie Newman , a U.S. Representative from Illinois, “there is not a shortage of Americans looking for work, there is a shortage of Americans willing to work for starvation wages with no benefits, no health care, and no protections during a pandemic.” About half of all states tried to force the issue and push people back into the job market. These states, most led by Republicans, discontinued the $300  federal unemployment benefit bonus  for their citizens ahead of the official Labor Day end date, or at least attempted to. Analysis from a payroll services company called  Gusto  showed that cutting off federal benefits didn’t lead to  more hiring . The federal unemployment bonus and the previous round of stimulus checks have helped Americans still awaiting their recovery to pay bills and put food on the table. The advance Child Tax Credit provides some additional support to families. But this money only goes so far. And some politicians feel that the payments haven’t been enough. Support For A Fourth Stimulus Check A group of Democratic Senators, including Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, sent a  letter to President Joe Biden  at the end of March requesting “recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions.” As the Senators reasoned in their letter, “this crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. Families should not be at the mercy of constantly-shifting legislative timelines and ad hoc solutions.” An earlier letter to  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris  from 53 Representatives, led by  Ilhan Omar  of Minnesota, carved out a similar position. “Recurring direct payments until the economy recovers will help ensure that people can meet their basic needs, provide racially equitable solutions, and shorten the length of the recession.” Additional co-signers included New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib, two other notable names among House Progressives. The letter didn’t place a number on the requested stimulus payments. But a tweet soon after put it at $2,000 per month for the length of the pandemic.   $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic is over.  https://t.co/6tuia6prFJ   — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN)  January 28, 2021 A  May 17 letter  from members of the House Ways and Means Committee renewed the push for additional stimulus. “The ARP’s $1,400 checks alone will keep 11 million people out of poverty this year, with UI (unemployment insurance) expansion and other provisions in the bill accounting for the another five million. A fourth and fifth check could keep an additional 12 million out of poverty. Combined with the effects of the ARP, direct payments could reduce the number in poverty in 2021 from 44 million to 16 million.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn There’s also been talk about  automatic payments  that could be sent when specific economic metrics reach certain thresholds (for example, if unemployment rises to 6 percent). These triggers would make stimulus checks a reactive force in countering economic dips, sparing struggling Americans from Congressional delays. A majority of Americans also favor recurring relief payments. According to a January poll from  Data For Progress , nearly two-thirds of all voters support $2,000 monthly payments to all Americans for the length of the pandemic. Supporters include a majority of Independents and Republicans. A struggling restaurant owner’s  online petition  calling for $2,000 monthly payments for every American adult has surpassed 2.9 million signatures. The  Urban Institute  estimated that another stimulus payment could reduce poverty by at least 6.4 percent in 2021. Many economists are also onboard. A 2020  open letter  from experts in the field argued “direct cash payments are an essential tool that will boost economic security, drive consumer spending, hasten the recovery, and promote certainty at all levels of government and the economy – for as long as necessary.” California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a  new budget  into law in July, which includes a stimulus check for about two-thirds of the state’s residents. The $100 billion California Comeback Plan, as part of their  $262.2 billion budget , is paying $600 to residents earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year. Residents in that income range who have kids are receiving $1,100. Those checks  started going out  the last Friday in August The state’s previous stimulus went to those with an annual income under $30,000. Other states have also authorized payments.  Maryland handed out  $300 or $500 checks to those who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on their tax returns.  Florida gave  $1,000 bonuses to teachers, which started showing up in August. Denton and Irving school districts in  north Texas  were scheduled to give retention bonuses of $500 and $2,000 respectively at the start of the school year. The Biden administration is also planning to give a one-time  $600 payment  to farm workers and meatpacking workers. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the plan in early September. The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated up to $700 million for the limited-scope stimulus check. The aid will be handed out through state agencies and include a pilot program giving extra money to grocery store workers. The Biden administration, which authored the third round of stimulus checks, isn’t against a fourth round. But the president recognizes their high price tag. He also has other priorities, specifically infrastructure and help for families. Neither the American Jobs Plan nor the American Families Plan, the administration’s original infrastructure and human infrastructure proposals, included another relief payment. Other plans currently bouncing around Congress don’t either. A Fourth Stimulus Check Is Unlikely All of the tacit and explicit support for stimulus checks keeps the possibility alive. The support doesn’t make a fourth payment likely, however. And there are many reasons why. Vaccinations are progressing steadily, albeit not as quickly as in the spring. Adults and those at least 12 years old are eligible to be inoculated in all 50 states. (Trials for children under 12 continue with approval expected mid-winter.) Three different options are available to the public, with the Pfizer vaccine fully approved by the FDA. Booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine have also been approved for those at risk or over 65. Actually putting needles in arms is taking time, even with supply readily available. Americans have received over 390 million doses, with 64.4 percent of the population having received at least one dose and 55.4 percent completely vaccinated. Vaccination numbers continue to increase at a rate of close to 600,000 doses per day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its guidance and recommends that vaccinated people in areas with higher COVID transmission revert to wearing  masks indoors  again. With vaccinations rising, the nation’s economy continues to recover. Looser restrictions have helped businesses, and jobs are available in many sectors. Many industries are even complaining of worker shortages, which are leading to wage increases. The number of new unemployment claims remains lower than it has been for much of the pandemic. In August,  consumer confidence  dropped due to ongoing concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices. Similarly,  consumer sentiment  also fell off earlier in the month. Confidence, however, remains higher than it’s been for much of the pandemic. Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the country’s economy. And excess pandemic savings, along with three stimulus checks, has boosted people’s spending power. That spending power has increased even more since monthly Child Tax Credit payments started on July 15. The most recent payment went out September 15. An improved financial position generally also raises optimism for the future. The ongoing vaccinations, which have allowed the economy to reopen to some degree, certainly help. All that additional spending, along with the release of pent-up demand, has led to the availability of more jobs as companies try to hire to address consumer needs. With the economy growing, a fourth round of stimulus checks seems less urgent. Aside from the generally improving economy, the political machinations of Washington make a fourth stimulus check a longshot. The American Rescue Plan, which included the third stimulus check, passed along party lines. Republicans were not interested in spending anywhere close to $1.9 trillion, though some did support the third relief payment. They termed the package a “blue state bailout,” claiming it went well beyond the scope of COVID and would increase the deficit, leading to inflation. The Democrats used a process called  reconciliation  to pass the bill in the Senate without Republican support. That allows budget-related matters to proceed with a simple majority rather than the filibuster-proof 60 votes. Generally only one reconciliation bill can pass per fiscal year. But a subsequent ruling by the  Senate parliamentarian , who interprets the legislative body’s rules, opened up a path for additional spending legislation. Without reconciliation, any bill would need at least 10 Republican votes, along with every Democratic vote. But the Biden administration has other priorities. One of its biggest, aside from keeping the federal government open, is addressing infrastructure. The proposed  American Jobs Plan , which aimed to rebuild roads, repair bridges, do away with lead pipes, extend broadband, modernize the country’s electric grid and much more, carried a price tag of $2.3 trillion. Biden and a group of Senators from both parties agreed upon a scaled-back infrastructure plan costing about $1 trillion. The resulting bipartisan bill, now called the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , passed the Senate in early August. Neither the original version nor the bipartisan bill that moved forward includes a fourth stimulus check. One could, in theory, be added when the House takes up the bill. That seems unlikely given the price tag. The American Families Plan, focused on childcare, education and more, would have cost another $1.8 trillion in its initial form. The Democrats are now pushing forward a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that focuses on their various “human infrastructure” initiatives, such as Medicare expansion, child care, and climate change. A fourth stimulus check is not included, though one could theoretically still be added as well. The Democrats’ extended plan is a more likely home for a fourth stimulus check than a traditional infrastructure plan. Funding these plans will almost certainly involve tax increases on corporations and wealthy individuals, which Republicans would oppose. Plenty more negotiating seems inevitable before any bill gets passed into law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised not to take up the infrastructure bill until the Senate also passes the human infrastructure bill. Democrats are already laying the groundwork to use reconciliation again to push through this legislation. Joe Manchin  of West Virginia, among the most centrist Democratic Senators, has warned against overusing reconciliation. He is also apparently unwilling to do away with the filibuster, which would lower the number of votes needed to pass legislation to 51. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema doesn’t want to abandon the filibuster either. Manchin also wants to see the human infrastructure bill shrink. With bipartisanship still hard to come by, the Biden administration is in a tough spot. They’re unlikely to add a fourth stimulus check to any plan, driving up the price tag by hundreds of billions of dollars. They’re also unlikely to use reconciliation to pass another stimulus check on its own. What Other Aid Is Out There? While a fourth stimulus check is improbable, more direct payments to Americans have already been signed into law. Up until Labor Day, the jobless received extended unemployment benefits. The American Rescue Plan also includes an advance Child Tax Credit. Under the revised Child Tax Credit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is paying out $3,600 per year for each child up to five years old and $3,000 per year for each child ages six through 17. Monthly payments of up to $300 per child started July 15 and will continue through December of 2021. The remainder is to be issued when the recipient files their 2021 taxes. The benefit does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. In other words, qualifying families will receive the full amount, regardless of how much — or little — they owe in taxes. Payments start to phase out beyond a $75,000 annual income for individuals and beyond $150,000 for married couples. The more generous credit will apply only for 2021, though Biden has stated his interest in extending it through 2025. The American Rescue Plan also extended the weekly federal unemployment insurance bonus of $300 through Labor Day. (As mentioned before, half of all states have ended the additional unemployment or or attempted to.) Those eligible for Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), which covered people who had used up their state benefits, and PUA had also seen their benefits extended through early September. The ARP also added $21.6 billion to the  Emergency Rental Assistance Program , which is being distributed to state and local governments, who then assist households. Most of the $46 billion total has yet to reach tenants and landlords. The infrastructure and human infrastructure plans also have the potential to create many jobs across a wide swath of the economy. How the proposed initiatives are ultimately distributed across the bipartisan bill or the broader Democratic plan remains to be seen. The American Families Plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave that could have reached as high as $4,000 per month, depending on a worker’s income. It also boosted the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and placed a ceiling on the cost of childcare for many families. The plan set aside $200 billion for universal preschool. In addition to helping working parents pay for childcare, the plan sought to allow more parents to return to the workforce. Look for similar programs and more when the specifics of the human infrastructure plan are worked out. Additional money in people’s pockets from any bill or proposed plan is still hypothetical, of course. Nothing has found its way through Congress yet. And it could be months until it does.

The seven-day average rate of people getting their first shot is 231,695, 31% less than last week, almost half — 47% — less than a month earlier — and a far cry from the  millions a day  the country saw in April. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured It’s not that there’s now a lack of people who are not immunized: Sixteen states have yet to vaccinate more than half of their residents, according to the CDC data, and almost 25% of the eligible population — about 70 million people — are not vaccinated. Just over 55% of the total US population is fully vaccinated. The number of people eligible to get a vaccine may soon be widening, though, and could boost the overall number. Pfizer/BioNTech plans to ask soon for authorization of a  Covid-19  vaccine for some children under 12, bringing the US one step closer to offering protection to a population that has grown particularly vulnerable as the fall season gets underway. “It is a question of days, not weeks,” Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla told ABC News on Sunday about when the company will submit data on children ages 5 to 11 to the US Food and Drug Administration for consideration. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Monday that the CDC will review data on vaccines for 5- to 11-year-olds with urgency. “We are all enthusiastically awaiting these data,” Walensky said, when asked how soon authorization and shots for kids could be seen after Pfizer submits its data. “As soon as they get submitted to the FDA, I know the FDA is urgently planning to review these data, it will go from the FDA to the CDC, and we will review it with similar urgency,” she continued. “And I’m hoping in the order of weeks.” Walensky said boosters for people who have gotten the Moderna and J&J vaccines will be addressed with similar urgency as Pfizer’s vaccine. She reiterated that the current booster recommendations are only for people who received their second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine more than six months ago. “We haven’t forgotten you if you’ve gotten Moderna and J&J,” Walensky said, when asked how soon boosters for these groups might be seen, and if mixing and matching of vaccines could happen in the near future. “We will with similar urgency address boosters for those populations, as well as looking at the science and data for mix and matching.” Currently, Covid-19 vaccines are only approved for children 12 and older, which has stirred concern among health experts as cases in children increase, school years begin and the more transmissible Delta variant spreads. Nearly 26% of all Covid-19 cases nationwide  are reported in children, according to recent data published by the  American Academy of Pediatrics.  And an average of 266 children were hospitalized with Covid-19 every day last week, according to Sunday’s  data from the CDC . Once the data from Pfizer/BioNTech is in, it will have to go through two committees, one for the FDA and one for the CDC, CNN medical analyst Dr. Johnathan Reiner said Sunday. If the data comes in this week, it would likely be in committee by the end of October, he added. And there is a lot of data for them to look at, he said. “This is a vaccine for children, so getting the dose right — in terms of efficacy and side effects — is crucial,” Reiner said. But even when a vaccine becomes available, a difficult task lies ahead in getting children vaccinated. Less than half of US adolescents are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data. In response, officials need to do a better job educating the public about the importance of vaccination for the health of their children and their families as a whole, Reiner said. “If you want kids in school, the best way to keep them in school is to keep them from getting Covid,” he said. Until vaccines are approved for younger children, the CDC has recommended  mask wearing for students, teachers and visitors in schools from kindergarten through grade 12,  along with improved ventilation, physical distancing and testing on a screening basis. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We know how to keep them safe,” Walensky told CBS on Sunday. “When we don’t use the proper mitigation, they’re more likely to have outbreaks.” Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said he encourages parents to vaccinate their children when they can. “This is a dangerous pathogen,” Gottlieb told CNN. “I wouldn’t be so cavalier about this virus, we know that this virus has long-term consequences in a lot of people who contract it, including children.” Current surge likely to die down by Thanksgiving, Gottlieb says Gottlieb predicted the current surge of coronavirus spread is likely to worsen across parts of the country and then die down by Thanksgiving. “I think you’ll see a wave of infection sweep across the Northeast as kids go back to school, the weather turns cold and people move indoors,” Gottlieb told CNN’s Pamela Brown. The virus won’t be gone, Gottlieb said, but hopefully it will reach more manageable levels — which he estimates to be about 20,000 cases per day. According to the CDC, the current seven-day average for new cases in the US is more than 114,000 new cases a day. The decline in cases will likely come from most people attaining immunity to the virus, Gottlieb said. “Some people will get a vaccination; some will challenge their immunity by no choice but getting the infection,” Gottlieb explained. “People who choose to go unvaccinated, they’re going to be vulnerable to getting infected through this Delta wave.” As the US moves into flu season, Gottlieb said, the demand for tests will pick up as people and their doctors try to determine if their flu-like symptoms are due to Covid-19 or influenza. “That’s why it’s so important to get diagnostic tests into the hands of consumers and doctors’ offices as well, things like where people can test in the home will make a difference between telling between Covid and other respiratory infections, especially as the flu picks up,” Gottlieb said. But even if Covid-19 cases do come down by Thanksgiving, health experts are bracing for a difficult winter ahead. It isn’t clear yet what this year’s flu season has in store, but it could add additional stress to an already pressed health care system. “Flu is still a killer, not as much as Covid-19, but between 12,000 and 50,000 Americans lose their lives every year from flu,”  said Dr. Peter Hotez , vaccinologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Last year’s flu numbers were low, which health expert say could mean that upcoming seasons may be worse, as there has been little accumulation of immunity. “We’re in for a whopper of a flu season at some point,” Gottlieb said Sunday. Recommending booster for frontline workers a ‘scientific close call,’ CDC director says On Friday, Walensky  recommended  a booster dose for adults at occupational risk of infection — in addition to those with underlying conditions and those over 65 — a decision she said was a “scientific close call.” “And because of that close call, and because of all of the evidence we reviewed at the FDA and the CDC, I thought it was appropriate for those people to be eligible for boosters,” Walensky told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “So who are those people? People who live and work in high-risk settings. That includes people in homeless shelters, people in group homes, people in prisons. But, also, importantly, are people who work with vulnerable communities, so our health care workers, our teachers, our grocery workers, our public transportation employees,” Walensky said. Although the CDC’s vaccine advisers voted against recommending booster doses for people at high risk of infection because of their work or living conditions, Walensky went with the FDA’s authorization including those people. The recommendation is not currently intended for the wider population, but there’s little fear of causing dangerous side effects from adding that third dose, Walensky said. “We have an extraordinary amount of safety data,” she said.

During Ngata’s nine seasons in purple and black, from 2006 to 2014, Baltimore allowed the fewest points per game (18.2) in the league and fewest rushing touchdowns (71), and the second-fewest net yards per game (306.5) and second-fewest rushing yards per game (92.5), the team said.

The lineman went on to play three seasons with the Detroit Lions and one with the Philadelphia Eagles. In 2019, he  announced his retirement  standing on top of Mount Kilimanjaro, later returning to Baltimore to officially retire as a Raven. A first-round draft pick in 2006, Ngata was named first-team All-Pro twice and was selected for the Pro Bowl five times.

The grants ranged from $3,000 for the school with the most logged cleanups to $500 for honorable mentions.

On Wednesday, the Baltimore Orioles announcer will receive a bigger national stage when she teams up with Jessica Mendoza on ESPN. Newman and Mendoza will call a key NL West matchup between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers have already wrapped up a postseason spot, but went into Tuesday two games behind San Francisco for the top spot in the division with six games remaining. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Newman said she was focused on her second season doing play-by-play on radio and television for the Baltimore Orioles when the additional opportunities to call games nationally came. “I knew I had a full season with the Orioles, we were going to bounce back and forth with TV and radio and it was going to be a great time. So when these other opportunities started coming along, it was really cool,” she said. “It just makes it all the more fun when you don’t expect it and you don’t set yourself up for those type of situations.” Newman — who called games in the minors for six seasons before going to Baltimore — became just the second woman to do play-by-play for a nationally broadcast game on June 22 when the Oakland Athletics faced the Texas Rangers on YouTube’s MLB Game of the Week. Longtime New York Yankees announcer Suzyn Waldman was the first during games on The Baseball Network in 1994-95. On July 20, Newman joined Sarah Langs, Alanna Rizzo, Heidi Watney and Lauren Gardner for the first national all-female broadcast. ESPN tried to look for opportunities to have Newman call some games earlier in the season, but wasn’t able to make it work until now. Newman also did the Sept. 22 matchup between San Diego and San Francisco on ESPN with Doug Glanville. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Newman and Mendoza both said that they found out about being paired on Wednesday like they would other assignments — very matter of fact without a lot of meetings. “It wasn’t like it was made internally to be this huge deal, more just two women that we feel like are doing a good job and we want to put them both on the same broadcast,” said Mendoza, who is in her seventh season as an MLB analyst on ESPN. Newman first got the opportunity to meet Mendoza two years ago during the Washington Nationals’ postseason run. Even though the game does have pennant race implications, Newman plans on handling the broadcast the same way she does every game. “I just think that speaks again to the fact that they’re not really placing any type of kid gloves on the situation as well, you know, it’s women. They’re going to give us the game just like they assign men the games,” she said. “The fact that it happens to be potentially playoff impacting. it’s kind of second nature to it. “I’m definitely excited, especially after being in the American League East all season. Getting to jump from one of the most exciting postseason races right into the other one (in the NL West). Those divisions have been the two storylines all year. Getting to play a very small piece in both of those this season, I feel really fortunate.” With the season concluding on Sunday, Newman will head to her offseason home in Georgia before preparing for the start of next season.

The Red Sox led 2-0 in the sixth before Mountcastle hit a two-run shot and Pedro Severino added an RBI single. A run-scoring single by Ryan McKenna made it 4-2 in the eighth, and Baltimore’s shaky bullpen made the advantage stand up. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Boston started the day with a one-game advantage over Toronto for the second and final AL wild-card slot. The Red Sox had dropped a game behind the Yankees for the No. 1 spot after being swept by New York in a three-game weekend series at Fenway Park. After a day off to regroup, Boston launched its final trip of the season with a matchup against the last-place Orioles. The Red Sox had won 12 of their last 13 games against Baltimore, and Sale’s domination of the Orioles — 10-0 in his previous last 13 starts — made the matchup appear even more lopsided. Kyle Schwarber put Boston up with his 32nd home run in the second inning, and Hunter Renfroe added a solo shot in the sixth. Sale (5-1) coasted through five innings, but in the sixth Kelvin Gutiérrez beat out an infield hit and Mountcastle went deep to tie it. Austin Hays followed with a single to end Sale’s night before Severino delivered his go-ahead hit off Hansel Robles. Sale gave up three runs and four hits, struck out six and walked two in his eighth start following elbow ligament replacement surgery. The lefty returned in August with a win over Baltimore and backed that up by beating the Orioles again on Sept. 17. Activated from the injured list before the game, Baltimore starter Bruce Zimmermann allowed one run, two hits and two walks over four innings in his first appearance since June 13. The rookie originally was sidelined with left biceps tendinitis before spraining his right ankle during the rehabilitation process. Marcos Diplán (2-0) pitched two innings, Joey Krehbel retired all six batters he faced and Cole Sulser worked the ninth for his eighth save. Baltimore has lost six games this season when holding a ninth-inning lead. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn EVERYONE’S AN MVP Asked to pick the most valuable player on the 2021 Red Sox, manager Alex Cora looked beyond the impressive numbers put up by Rafael Devers, J.D. Martinez, Renfroe and several other offensive stars by diplomatically declining to pick one name from the bunch. “There are guys who are having monster seasons, but when you break it down everyone has contributed, and that’s why we’re in this position,” Cora said. “I don’t think it’s fair to say this guy or that guy. As a group, they’ve been amazing.” TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: RHP Garrett Whitlock (pectoral strain) threw around 60 pitches on the side Tuesday. “He felt good. Now we’ll see how he reacts today and tomorrow,” Cora said. Whitlock (8-4, 1.99 ERA) can come off the IL on Thursday, but Cora said that’s likely not going to happen. … Cora had no update on LHP Josh Taylor (lower back strain). Orioles: OF Anthony Santander’s injury-plagued season ended Tuesday when he was placed on the 10-day IL with a right knee sprain. “He’s been banged up for a while now,” manager Brandon Hyde said. “It was a strange year for him in that he was never fully healthy. I give him a lot of credit for hanging in there.” Santander had 18 homers and 50 RBIs in 110 games. … RHP Chris Ellis (right shoulder inflammation) was put on the 10-day IL. UP NEXT Red Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (10-9, 3.88 ERA) starts Wednesday night, looking to rebound from a rocky start against the Yankees in which he allowed seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. Boston was 6-0 in his previous six starts. Orioles: Rookie LHP Zac Lowther (1-2, 7.66) earned his first big league victory last week against Texas, but in two appearances against Boston he’s surrendered a combined 10 runs in 5 2/3 innings.

In the American League, the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, and Seattle Mariners all sit within 2.5 games of each other for the two wild card spots. In the National League, the Atlanta Braves lead the Philadelphia Phillies by 2.5 games in the race for the NL East title. Out west, the San Francisco Giants are outpacing the Los Angeles Dodgers for the division title. This week’s Baseball Report looks at the Yankees’ jump to the top of the AL wild card race and the NL West division race between MLB’s two winningest teams. Yankees Sweep Red Sox READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts The Tampa Bay Rays have led the American League East for the last two months. That lead has grown in September, leaving the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Toronto Blue Jays to jockey for Wild Card positioning. Only two teams from the American League (and two from the National League) will play in the Wild Card Game. And the Seattle Mariners and Oakland A’s also remain within striking distance. With a week of games left, the race for those two spots is too close to call. Going into  Friday’s action , the Red Sox held the homefield advantage in the Wild Card race. They sat two games ahead of the Yankees, who would be the visiting team, if the game were to be played that day. The Blue Jays, at three games back, were on the outside looking in. By Sunday night, the race looked a little different. The Yankees’ three-game series at Fenway could not have gone any better for the Bronx Bombers, or any worse for the Red Sox. Boston started the series in their lucky yellow jerseys, riding a seven-game winning streak. But Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole took a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning. Giancarlo Stanton managed three hits, including a three-run homer to right-center. Gleyber Torres added a solo shot for one of his two RBI. The 8-3 result cut the Red Sox lead for home-field advantage to one game. The Red Sox jumped out to a two-run lead on Saturday. But Stanton would stay hot. Red Sox reliever Tanner Houck issued two two-out walks in the eighth inning. Reliever Darwinzon Hernandez then walked the bases loaded for Stanton, who belted a  grand slam  over the Green Monster to put the Yankees ahead. READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University The Red Sox and Yankees were tied going into Sunday night’s game. Boston held a 3-2 lead going into the seventh, after Yankees outfielders dropped a pair of easy popups. Aaron Judge came to the plate with runners on second and third and one out. The Red Sox had multiple chances to send the slugger back to the dugout, but couldn’t convert. Judge then lined a two-run double to left-center to make the score 4-3. Stanton would follow that up with a two-run homer again over the Green Monster. The Yankees would eventually  win 6-3  and leave Boston with a one-game lead in the race for the top Wild Card spot. Stanton finished the series with  seven hits  in his 12 at-bats. That includes three home runs and 10 RBI, which is more runs batted in than the Red Sox had in the series as a team. And much of his production came in pressure situations. Stanton was the first Yankee to pile up 10 RBI against the Red Sox since Mickey Mantle did it in 1954. National League West Race Neither the Giants not the Dodgers are fighting for their playoff lives. The Giants are 102-54 as of Monday night, with the most wins the team has had in almost three decades. The Dodgers sit two games back at 100-56. Both teams have long since clinched a playoff spot. But the NL West title remains very much in play. The  Giants have won  15 of their last 19 games as of Sunday. That includes a three-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies over the weekend. San Francisco returns home from Colorado with a chance to win the division. They’ll open a three-game series against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Tuesday, and then end the regular season with another three-game series with the San Diego Padres. The Giants will be without their home run leader,  Brandon Belt . The first baseman broke his left thumb in Sunday’s game while attempting to bunt. MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts The  Dodgers kept pace  Sunday, topping the Diamondbacks to take two of the three games in their weekend series. Julio Urías pitched five innings of shutout ball to capture his MLB-leading 19th win. Corey Seager hit two out of the park, helping the Dodgers to a 3-0 win. The Dodgers open a three-game set with the Padres Tuesday night and follow that with three against the Milwaukee Brewers to close the regular season.

The path is also a sort of scenic shortcut from the front gate to the most popular zoo habitats. The “Main Valley” is where the zoo began in the mid-1800s as an informal menagerie of random animals entrusted to the Park Superintendent by locals, the zoo said. But in 1876, the Maryland General Assembly agreed to formally create “a  zoo logical collection within the limits of Druid Hill Park for the purpose of public exhibition for the instruction and recreation of the people.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The zoo closed the Main Valley in 2004, and the antiquated area became a service drive for employees. Over the years, plants reclaimed the iron cages, stone dens and other buildings in the section, but the zoo removed the growth and paved a path for visitors. There will be signage so visitors know what they’re looking at. “With the addition of signs highlighting interesting moments in  Zoo  history, we are happy to welcome  Zoo  guests to experience a walk through the past, which we hope will showcase how far  zoo s have come from menageries to conservation centers for endangered species.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The zoo said some of the historic buildings and exhibits that guests will pass include:   Iron-barred cages and stone dens were constructed from 1902 through the 1930s, many of them as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration (WPA). They are relics of an older era when the goal was to showcase exotic animals to a curious public.   Built in 1930, the Crane Barn was originally known as the Camel House. It has housed several different species over the years, including camels, zebra, moose, and cranes. Currently, there are Abyssinian ground hornbills living at the Crane Barn.   The Round Cage is the oldest exhibit at the  Zoo . It was considered state-of-the-art when it was built in the late 1800s.   The Round Stand structure was built in the 19 th  century when the Mansion House was still a private home. Originally, it served as a covered hitching post for horses. Years later, it was converted into a reptile house, a monkey house and then into a refreshment stand for  Zoo  visitors. The Round Stand has undergone a small restoration which included patching up the roof and repainting the building to what are believed to be the original paint colors.   An aquatic exhibit built in 1910 across from the Elephant House became home to the  Zoo ’s sea lions. Many years later, the water was drained and the pool filled with dirt to create a home for prairie dogs. The prairie dogs moved from the Main Valley to a renovated habitat near the  Zoo  entry in 2009.   The polar bear exhibit opened in 1942 and housed polar bears until the last residents, Magnet and Alaska, moved to Polar Bear Watch in 2004.   Mary Ann, the  Zoo ’s first elephant, moved into the brand-new Elephant House in 1926. That same year, a 600-pound baby Nile hippopotamus named George was transported to Baltimore from the National  Zoo  in Washington, D.C.  George was the  Zoo ’s first hippopotamus and he lived at the opposite end of the building from Mary Ann.  For several decades, Nile hippos and elephants lived on opposite sides of the building, each with a small outdoor area. The hippos moved into the Hippo House in 1967, and the elephants moved to the expanded elephant habitat in The African Journey in 1985.   Down the hill past the Old Elephant House are the Upper and Lower Wading Bird yards, originally built in part to house penguins, which later took up residence at Rock Island and now Penguin Coast.  These yards were also once home to the  Zoo ’s flock of flamingos and a wide variety of ducks and other small waterfowl.   Some bird species reside in the Crane Barn, but there won’t be animals in the antiquated cage and exhibits. “Animals will not be returning to the obsolete cages, but we have launched a planning process to consider ways to accommodate the return of animals to Main Valley at some point in the future,” said Fowler.

A jury took less than two hours to reject Ramos’ defense. Anne Arundel County’s State’s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess asked Judge Michael Wachs to sentence the defendant to five life sentences for each of the five victims. Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters were killed during the attack.

The center is adjacent to the renovated Beatty Hall. University press release states that the renovation is the most important large-scale academic renovation on Loyola’s campus in 10 years. “The building really represents a physical manifestation of a movement that’s been going on here at Loyola for a while,” said Terrence Sawyer, Senior Vice President of Loyola University Maryland. “And that is really a movement around innovation and collaborative learning and just new ways that our faculty are teaching, new ways new ways that our students are looking to learn.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The building features active learning classrooms that are open and can be easily reconfigured for different teaching styles. It also includes the Forbes Idea Lab, a space encircled by 360-degrees of whiteboards to encourage brainstorming, the Rizzo Career Center, an academic loft for students and faculty to engage in interdisciplinary learning, a café, outdoor space and new technology. “I think the technology that built into the building is nothing that I’ve seen in any other buildings,” said Kaleigh Gallagher, a senior. “This has like cameras built into the tv so you can have webinars and seminars.” Collaborative spaces for students to work together are another key feature of the building. “It was really built with the idea of collaborative in mind and working in teams which I think is something that I think every school needs,” said Baldwin.

READ MORE:  'It's A Mess, I Feel Angry' Ongoing USPS Mail Delays Leaves Residents Frustrated In Baltimore County This new leadership comes amid continued frustrations in the region over a lack of mail service and major delays with mail delivery. Among them is Parkville resident Kathy Ader who lives off Harford Road. She said you’re lucky if you get your mail once or twice a week, if at all. And when it does come, it’s always late. Her message for Baltimore’s new Postmaster, is, “help!” “You know, companies don’t wanna hear why I didn’t get the bill, that’s why I’m late, you know you gotta pay interest and late fees and all that and when you’re on a fixed income it’s really hard,” Ader said. And Ader is just one of many. The problems with the post offices and mail service have plagued multiple areas across the Baltimore region including Parkville, Essex, Rosedale, Middle River, Loch Raven and Dundalk for over a year. “It’s been a battle day in and day out,” said Congressman Ruppersberger in July. But now, the USPS has swapped out the old management for a new one, in the roles of Maryland’s District Manager and Baltimore’s Postmaster, replacing Le Gretta Ross-Rawlins with Eric Gilbert. READ MORE:  USPS Mail Delays Continue Across Baltimore Area; Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger Says He Working Closely With Local Postmaster To Find Solution It’s a change that’s also being met with some pushback. “I appreciate the idea of a new postmaster but I want a postmaster with a plan,” said Congressman Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.). Congressman Mfume believes Baltimore’s Postmaster can only succeed if the nation’s current Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is removed. “I believe we need to get back on track with a different Postmaster General. One that will come in and give the local Postmaster everything that he or she needs,” he added. But Postmaster General DeJoy said USPS is doing its best in the wake of major staffing shortages and a financial crisis. “There is difficult work that is ahead of us to fix the systemic problems that have plagued the postal service but I am confident that these problems can be solved,” DeJoy said in March. But in the meantime, residents are still hoping and waiting for their mail.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .06% to 4.13%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 11 to 785. Of those hospitalized, 585 remain in acute care and 200 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 529,736 total confirmed cases and 10,183 deaths. There are 3,884,282 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,890,885 doses. Of those, 3,940,494 are first doses with 3,863 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,583,045 second doses, 3,470 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 301,237 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 445 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 66,109 additional or booster vaccine doses, 5,485 in the last day. The state reported 83.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

He slowed down a bit when diagnosed with COVID-19 last November but described his symptoms as mild. Later, his family became worried when lingering symptoms progressed. “The weights that I was regularly using were entirely too heavy for me,” Stipetich said. His wife and daughters pleaded with him to go back to the doctor. “Make sure everything is OK with your lungs, go get everything checked,” Stipetich said. That was January. Doctors told him he was healthy. But in April, Stipetich came down with a cold and couldn’t sleep. “I would wake up and feel like I was suffocating,” Stipetich said. His family urged him to go to the hospital, believing he may have COVID-19 again. It turned out Stipetich was very sick and in cardiogenic shock. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Throughout all these tests, they came back and said, there is nothing more that they can do for me,” Stipetich said. The news became more terrifying when Stipetich found out his kidneys and liver were failing, and so was his heart. “His heart had given way to a point that he needed to have his life sustained by a mechanical heart pump,” said Dr. Azam Hadi, an advanced heart failure cardiologist at Allegheny Health Network. Dr. Hadi was on Stipetich’s team at AGH. “We were able to turn his shock process around to a point where he recovered his organs except his heart,” the doctor said. Next, Stipetich and his family would learn he needed a transplant. After eight days of his heart being pumped artificially, a donor heart arrived. Dr. Hadi said he has seen a lot of COVID-19 heart issues, including death, but this was a first. Doctors believe the virus remained dormant in Stipetich’s body. “The dormant virus continued to cause inflammation of the heart. And inflammation, in turn, makes the heart weak and get scarred and not able to pump,” Dr. Hadi said. Recovery hasn’t been easy. Stipetich’s strong body took another hit, as his mobility has been impacted. But now several months in, Stipetich is gaining energy. And while extreme sports and lifting may not be in his future, Stipetich and his family have a new purpose.

How could that affect you?", "originalurl": "https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2021/09/29/government-shutdown-what-happens-debt-ceiling/", "previousfetches": 0, "bodytext": "( CBS Detroit ) —  The federal government looks to be heading toward another shutdown. The government’s fiscal year ends Thursday, September 30, but lawmakers have yet to fund the government or suspend the debt ceiling. If nothing happens before Friday, most federal employees will stop going to work and many Americans could start to see a loss of certain services. How Does It Come To This? The government spends more money than it receives in tax revenue. That annual budget deficit is paid for by borrowing additional money. But there is a limit to how much the country can borrow to pay its existing obligations. It’s called the debt ceiling. That ceiling is increased or suspended whenever spending approaches its limit, allowing the government to borrow more money and stay open. But without an agreement in Congress, the Treasury Department can’t keep paying the federal government’s bills. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The  debt ceiling  was established over a century ago as a way to prevent federal agencies from ignoring Congress’s right to control spending. For decades increasing it was a relatively routine event without much fanfare. But the decision has grown increasingly politicized in recent years. On Monday,  Senate Republicans  blocked a bill that would have suspended the debt ceiling through December 22 and funded the government through December 3, avoiding a shutdown. The votes fell along party lines, leaving it 10 short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Reconciliation, which would only require 50 votes plus the Vice President’s tiebreaker, is the likely next step. Should the government fail to raise the debt ceiling, it would soon run the risk of  defaulting on its loans . Any default would be the first in the country’s history and send tremors across financial markets across the country and the world. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress on Tuesday that the federal government would cease to be able to pay its bills on October 18 or thereabouts. What Services Could See Changes? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn If Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit by midnight Thursday, a full government shutdown would begin Friday morning. Only  essential federal employees  will report to work that day and every day forward until the limit is raised. Non-essential employees would stop working. The federal government employs about 2.1 million people, not including the Postal Service. And every agency has its own shutdown procedures, so the definition of “essential” varies. In early 2018, when the government experienced a partial shutdown, about 850,000 workers stayed home. The potential scope of a shutdown this year could easily meet or exceed that number. With every agency executing its own shutdown plan, it’s unclear what services will be affected. Drawing from previous experience, it seems possible that national parks will be closed to visitors. Parks were closed during the 2013 shutdown, but some remained open during the 2018-19 shutdown. The National Science Foundation, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, and National Institute of Standards and Technology all suspended work three years ago. Other government work will almost certainly also be delayed The Internal Revenue Service could stop verifying income and Social Security numbers, leading to delays for personal loans. The  Federal Housing Administration  and Small Business Administration may not be able to process new loan applications either. Parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health could  cease operations , which seems less than ideal during an ongoing pandemic. It’s unclear how a shutdown would affect clinical trials of the COVID vaccine for children ages 5-12. What About Essential Services? MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Employees deemed essential must continue to report to work without pay. Based on past shutdowns, plenty of services that millions rely on should continue in the short-term. That includes border protection, air traffic control, law enforcement, and power grid maintenance. Mail will continue to arrive, because the postal service funds itself rather than relying on federal tax dollars. Social security checks and food stamps will also continue to arrive.                                 ", "sentiment": 0.1321951037468279, "subjectivity": 0.4476974175250039, "wordcount": 707}

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by 0.08% to 4.05%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 10 to 775. Of those hospitalized, 577 remain in acute care and 198 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 530,861 total confirmed cases and 10,196 deaths. There are 3,887,655 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,904,073 doses. Of those, 3,944,222 are first doses with 3,728 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,586,124 second doses, 3,079 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A total of 301,531 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 445 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 72,196 additional or booster vaccine doses, 6,087 in the last day. The state reported 83.6% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

During an investigation dating back to December 2020, inspectors observed dead rodents and insects in a supply room, damaged or missing ceiling tiles likely caused by water leaks, a damaged access door, and an outside dumpster that often fills up with trash from nearby residents and businesses. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured While the health department contracted a pest control company to remove old traps and install new ones, a janitorial company that cleans the building refuses to remove dead rodents, the report said. The heating and cooling system in the building at 1515 W. North Ave., does not properly regulate the temperature. One health department employee reported an indoor temperature of 90 degrees in March 2021, the report said. Multiple workers told the OIG that rapid tests for HIV and hepatitis C had to be halted on some days due to the heat. “Relevant correspondence obtained by the OIG suggested extreme temperatures could cause inaccurate test results or otherwise impact proper storage of the test kits,” the report said, noting that manufacturers for rapid HIV tests and rapid hepatitis C tests suggest keeping samples in storage between 35 degrees and 80 degrees and between 36 degrees and 86 degrees, respectively. Inspectors on a site visit noticed several rapid tests that were marked “expired.” The conditions are potentially violations of Occupational Health and Safety Administration regulations and agreements between the city and labor unions to “provide employees with a safe and healthy workplace,” the report said.

In December 2020, the boiler failed and there was no heat for several days, leading to the installation of a temporary unit, Dzirasa said. The agency has allocated $150,000 for the a partial HVAC system upgrade. Dzirasa also said pest control at the building has lapsed due to “delays in payments” to the contractor that’s been hired to service the building every two weeks.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Earlier this year, the NBA announced the creation of the  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion award , “a new annual honor that will recognize a current NBA player for pursuing social justice and upholding the league’s decades-long values of equality, respect and inclusion.” Abdul-Jabbar insists that it’s part of a player’s responsibility as a public figure to avoid spreading false narratives and to be aware of the significant social impact they have on their communities.   (Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Turner Sports)   “They are failing to live up to the responsibilities that come with celebrity. Athletes are under no obligation to be spokespersons for the government, but this is a matter of public health,” said Abdul-Jabar in an email to  Rolling Stone . “By not encouraging their people to get the vaccine, they’re contributing to these deaths. I’m also concerned about how this perpetuates the stereotype of dumb jocks who are unable to look at verified scientific evidence and reach a rational conclusion.” These comments come with NBA media day’s taking place across the country and the upcoming season quickly approaching. The league continues to incentive getting the vaccine by requiring unvaccinated players to submit to regular testing – once on practice or travel days and at least once on game days,  according to the Associated Press . Fully vaccinated players will not be required to submit to regular testing. However, that hasn’t stopped some of the NBA’s most high-profile superstars from refusing to publicly acknowledge their vaccination status. Despite multiple media outlets reporting that nearly 90 percent of NBA players are fully vaccinated, there have been  multiple players  who have publicly spoken against the vaccine sparking controversy in locker rooms across the association. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Kyrie Irving, who was not present for Brooklyn Nets media day due to health and safety protocols, has been one of the most vocal players about being unvaccinated.

Therefore, if Irving were to remain unvaccinated, he would be ineligible to play at home games at the Barclays Center. Washington Wizards superstar Bradley Beal, who missed the Olympics with USA Basketball after being placed in health and safety protocols, has joined Irving in publicly criticizing the emphasis being put on vaccination status. “What happens if one of our players gets the vaccine and can’t play after that? Or they have complications after that? Because there are cases like that,” said Beal regarding breakthrough cases among those that are fully-vaccinated. Abdul-Jabbar expressed his frustration with players who are refusing the vaccine and fail to do “the necessary research.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “What I find especially disingenuous about the vaccine deniers is their arrogance at disbelieving immunology and other medial experts,” he said. “Yet, if their child was sick or they themselves needed emergency medical treatment, how quickly would they do exactly what those same experts told them to do?”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.011330470604664153, "subjectivity": 0.3831998646514776, "wordcount": 684}

It’s a position I love to be in and I love joining wonderful things. I genuinely can’t mess it up because I’m not the thing making it great in the first place.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Franchot, who’s running for governor, wants most of that to go into the state’s rainy day fund until officials identify the most pressing needs. “That money should go to people that need it the most,” said Chrissy Holt of Our Revolution Maryland Our Revolution, a political action committee chaired by Holt, has been pushing for eviction relief and other protections for the vulnerable throughout the pandemic. “If you have excess, surplus money, why don’t you fully fund the government agencies that are specifically designed to help people?” she wondered.

Martinez homered and drove in three runs to back a dominant pitching performance by Nathan Eovaldi, and the Boston Red Sox broke a four-game skid and bolstered their playoff hopes by beating the Baltimore Orioles 6-0 Wednesday night. Hunter Renfroe also went deep for the Red Sox, who failed to score three runs in any game during their losing streak. Although Boston didn’t completely recover its offensive mojo, the 13-hit attack was more than enough to get past the last-place Orioles.

Toronto was also in the mix, one game behind Boston. Martinez hit his 28th homer in the second inning for a 1-0 lead, and the Red Sox used a broken-bat single and an error to tack on two unearned runs in the sixth. Eovaldi (11-9) took it from there, limiting Baltimore to four hits and striking out seven over six innings. The right-hander was 0-2 in his previous eight starts, including a loss Friday night in which he yielded seven runs to the Yankees. Boston had seven hits after five innings with only one run to show for it against rookie Zac Lowther, who yielded 10 runs and 12 hits over his previous two starts against the Red Sox. Lowther (1-3) was pulled after Rafael Devers cracked his bat on a leadoff single in the sixth. Xander Bogaerts subsequently reached on an error by third baseman Kelvin Gutiérrez before Martinez smacked a two-run double. Alex Verdugo added a two-run single in the eighth, and Renfroe hit his 30th homer in the ninth.

Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, chair of the House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, which conducted the investigation. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Several baby food manufacturers CNN contacted disagree with the subcommittee’s assessment, and all say they are committed to working closely with the US Food and Drug Administration to address the issue. Arsenic and other heavy metals are natural elements found in soil, water and air. Rice, which is a common ingredient in baby cereal, is grown submersed in water and is especially good at absorbing inorganic arsenic, the most toxic form. Exposure to heavy metals in baby food became a growing concern for parents after Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals, tested 168 baby foods from major manufacturers in the US. The testing found 95% of sampled baby foods contained lead, 73% contained arsenic, 75% contained cadmium and 32% contained mercury. One fourth of the baby foods contained all four heavy metals. The results mimicked a previous study by the US Food and Drug Administration that found one or more of the same metals in 33 of 39 types of baby food tested. “Even in trace amounts, these contaminants can alter the developing brain and erode a child’s IQ,” said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies Bright Futures. “The impacts add up with each meal or snack a baby eats — especially when the levels are as high as Healthy Babies Bright Futures’ research and the subcommittee’s new report show.” Earlier investigation  In an earlier investigation released in February, the subcommittee looked at internal testing documents from four major baby food manufacturers: Gerber; Beech-Nut Nutrition; Nurture, Inc., which sells Happy Baby products; and Hain Celestial Group, Inc., which sells Earth’s Best Organic baby food. The documents showed some products contained levels of lead, mercury, cadmium and inorganic arsenic were far above limits set for bottled water by the FDA and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Ground water can easily absorb heavy metals from the soil, and old lead pipes leak, so drinking water is a key exposure to heavy metals. Inorganic arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury are in the World Health Organization’s top 10 chemicals of concern for infants and children. Of the four companies, the subcommittee found only Nurture tested the final product — the actual food babies would eat — after all ingredients had been added. The rest of the companies tested some, but not all ingredients, the investigation found. That’s a significant concern, the report said, because each ingredient may have levels of toxins that fall under the cutoff for safety — but when added together, they may exceed government standards. There is no safe level of lead for children, according to the EPA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While there are no specific limits set for infant foods, the EPA and FDA set an upper limit of 2 parts per billion of inorganic mercury in drinking water, and 5 parts per billion for cadmium. In 2016 the FDA introduced a standard of 100 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal, finalizing that guidance in August 2020. But that level is too high to protect babies’ brains, critics said, especially considering the agency had already set the limit for bottled water at 10 parts per billion (ppb). “FDA set the limit at 100 ppb because it was focused on the level of inorganic arsenic that would cause cancer. It disregarded the risk of neurological damage, which happens at a much lower level,” the report stated. A maximum level of inorganic arsenic in baby food should be set at 10 parts per billion, the report said, “with a 15 ppb limit for infant cereal, as proposed in the (proposed) Baby Food Safety Act.” An FDA spokesperson told CNN that the agency continues to make “steady progress towards developing action levels for lead in foods and evaluating the science to establish reference levels for arsenic and cadmium.” “We look forward to providing additional updates on our efforts as new data, information, progress updates and additional material are made available.” Investigation continues  In May, the state of Alaska conducted a FDA-funded analysis of Beech-Nut’s and Gerber’s infant rice cereals and found “multiple samples” contained more inorganic arsenic than the “FDA’s 100 parts per billion (ppb) limit,” the report stated. In early June, Beech-Nut Nutrition issued a voluntary recall of two infant rice cereals with product codes 103470XXXX and 093470XXXX. The company also announced that it was exiting the infant rice cereal market. “Beech-Nut is concerned about the ability to consistently obtain rice flour well-below the FDA guidance level and Beech-Nut specifications for naturally occurring inorganic arsenic,” the FDA said in the recall announcement. However, the subcommittee criticized Beech-Nut in the new report, saying the manufacturer had not gone far enough to protect the public. “Beech-Nut only recalled two of its six products that tested over the limit,” the House subcommittee stated. Beech-Nut Nutrition told CNN that “the assertion that Beech-Nut’s rice cereal recall was too narrow is incorrect” because it proactively withdrew all of its rice cereal products from supermarket shelves. “Beech-Nut has taken a leadership role and is the first and only national brand to commit to being a fully rice-free brand across its full product portfolio,” the company said. The subcommittee report was also critical of Gerber. “Gerber was even worse (than Beech-Nut) —it had two products test over the 100 ppb limit and took no action to tell the public or get them off the shelves,” the subcommittee stated. A Gerber spokesperson told CNN that the FDA had retested the samples, and was unable to confirm the result by Alaska, adding that the FDA “confirmed to Gerber that no action was needed.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “While the Subcommittee report notes proposed limits on specific heavy metals, those are based on proposed standards from the Baby Food Safety Act, which are not current law or regulation. All Gerber foods have and continue to meet all applicable guidelines and limits set by the FDA, the governing body for safety regulations in the food industry,” the spokesperson said. Additional companies investigated  In their original report released in February, the House subcommittee said three companies had failed to fully cooperate with the investigation. Those baby food manufacturer’s are: Sprout Organic Foods, now owned by Canadian cannabis company Neptune Wellness Solutions  Campbell Soup Company, which in March sold Plum Organics to Sun-Maid Growers of California  Walmart, which manufactures Parent’s Choice baby food.  Since February, those companies have cooperated to “varying degrees,” the new report said. Internal company documents provided by Sprout, Campbell and Walmart show similar failures to test or monitor their baby food products, investigators found. Samples of Plum Organics baby foods tested between 2017 and 2019 contained levels of toxic heavy metals that greatly exceeded safety limits, the investigators reported. “Plum’s finished products contain up to 225 ppb inorganic arsenic. The majority of Plum’s baby foods also contain over 5 ppb lead, and nearly 40% exceed 5 ppb cadmium,” the subcommittee noted. A Campbell spokesperson told CNN that despite selling the Plum Organics brand, they will continue to cooperate with the “subcommittee throughout this process” and will continue “support the FDA’s efforts in setting clear and specific science-based federal standards.” Sun-Maid Growers of California told CNN in an email that it will “thoroughly examine the updated report from the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy and continue to work with the subcommittee — as well as the industry at large — to address these matters.” In 2018, Walmart “abandoned” a standard in place since 2013 that set an internal inorganic arsenic limit of 23 parts per billion for the baby food it sells, the report said, “quadrupling it” to allow up to 100 parts per billion. “Walmart offered no justification for its extreme course reversal on protecting babies’ neurological development,” the report stated. Walmart’s senior director of national media relations, Randy Hargrove, told CNN that the company had “always required that our suppliers’ products meet the guidelines established by the FDA. Our specifications have always been aligned with or below the FDA requirements for naturally occurring elements and the FDA noted in April that its testing shows that children ‘are not at an immediate health risk to exposure.’ ” In the April release cited by Walmart, the FDA also noted that research has shown “reducing exposure to toxic elements is important to minimizing any potential long-term effects on the developing brains of infants and children.” Finally, investigators found Sprout’s testing practices “to be the most reckless among baby food manufacturers,” the report stated, because it only requires yearly testing for toxic metals and fails to test their finished products. Sprout has not responded to a CNN request for comment on the new report. But on its website, Sprout says that it is ready to make any changes to our “sourcing or processing systems that may be advised by the FDA,USDA, or other relevant regulatory bodies. Sprout will always comply with regulatory guidance and continue to monitor developments closely.” Role of manufacturers and FDA  In both reports, the subcommittee recommended the baby food industry voluntarily test the final product to be sold and address the problem of toxic metals in baby food by phasing out ingredients that are high in toxic heavy metals. “Based on my Subcommittee’s findings, I’m urgently calling on the baby food industry to immediately end harmful practices and conduct finished-product testing,” Krishnamoorthi said in the statement. In addition, the subcommittee is urging the FDA to move faster in its efforts to establish specific regulations and mandate testing of final baby food products, not just ingredients. In March, the FDA told baby food manufacturers they must consider toxic chemicals when they test their baby food for potential hazards, but the agency was criticized for not quickly setting concrete rules to remove toxic heavy metals from all baby foods. “We have been working closely with FDA on regulations, and this report highlights the need for the agency to accelerate its proposed timeline for publishing them,” Krishnamoorthi said. However, there are potential downsides to moving too quickly on regulations, the FDA said. “While we understand that people may want rapid changes, it is crucial that measures to limit toxic elements in foods do not have unintended consequences—like limiting access to foods that have significant nutritional benefits by making them unavailable or unaffordable for many families,” a spokesperson told CNN. Actions for parents  Parents can act as well, experts say, by pushing their representatives to support the proposed Baby Food Safety Act or by refusing to purchase baby foods from manufacturers who do not comply with the safety recommendations. Parents can also try to avoid foods, such as rice, that typically absorb more heavy metals from the soil. The 2019 investigation by Healthy Babies Bright Futures found cereal and rice-based snacks like puffs had the highest arsenic levels. When rice is served, Healthy Babies’ Houlihan suggests cooking the rice in two steps:   Boil 1 cup of rice with 4 cups water for 5 minutes   Pour into a colander and discard the water   Cook drained rice with 2 cups fresh water over low to medium heat, covered until cooked.   Using this method “can remove up to 70 percent of the arsenic while still preserving some of the nutrients,” Houlihan said. The group’s investigation also found carrots and sweet potatoes to be among those most contaminated with lead and cadmium. But don’t eliminate carrots and sweet potatoes entirely, Healthy Babies’s Houlihan advised, because they are full of vitamin A and other key nutrients. Instead, “serve a variety of fruits and vegetables, instead of serving the same thing every day. This avoids accidentally concentrating any particular contaminant in a child’s diet,” Houlihan advised. The Healthy Babies analysis found parents can reduce their baby’s risk of exposure to lead and cadmium by 73% by taking these steps. When carrots, sweet potatoes and other root vegetables are served, be sure to peel them to remove heavy metals on the surface, she said, adding that “organic and homemade baby foods also contain heavy metals, so the steps above apply to those foods as well.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Annie Chambers of the Peoples’ Power of Assembly. The rally comes as immigration enforcement cleared a massive camp of Haitian migrants in texas last week. Four thousand migrants were sent back to their country with no asylum under title 42, which allows expulsions under health emergencies like the pandemic. “It angers me it really does because they don’t treat anybody else like that,” said Leon Purnell with the Peoples’ Power of Assembly.

Not just that, we are rebuilding Baltimore. If you go to any construction site, the majority of workers are Latinos,” said Solera. In fact, US census data shows the city’s Hispanic and Latino population doubled in just a decade — from about four percent in 2010 to eight percent in 2020. Primarily in Baltimore City, the largest group within the Latino community is the Mexican community — which is very large — Then you have El Salvadorians, then you have Hondurans, Dominicans, Ecuadorians and so on.

The event will include the Latino cultural festival and parade of Latino nations. “Brings together many different folk groups, marching band, floats, cars trucks representing different countries different cultures, different styles of music,” Solero added. It’s a reminder of the diverse cultures that enrich Baltimore and the contribution of immigrants of all nationalities to our region. “This is where the Latino community is, has been and will continue to do so for the years,” Solero said. “We are here to stay.

The drive, put on by the American Red Cross, was a part of the organization’s fight to get more African Americans to donate blood that could be helpful for people with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell is an inherited blood disorder that primarily impacts African Americans. Those with sickle cell could need numerous blood transfusions throughout their lives to treat their disease.

During the blood drive, the American Red Cross also recognized Morgan State University for winning the organization’s HBCU 16 Day Challenge. Students at colleges across the country were asked to spread the word about the need for sickle cell blood donors over the summer. Morgan State came in first place. “One in 13 black and African Americans carry the sickle cell trait, and many are unaware,” American Red Cross Regional Diversity Account Manager Meosha Hudson said. “So, the challenge was an opportunity to shed light on that disparity, to shed light on the need to do something about it and to activate the HBCU community to really lead the country on making sure those patients are not forgotten.” Homeopathic therapies like massage and aromatherapy can comfort patients, but there is no cure for sickle cell.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The housing department has received 38,894 applications for relief. “The basis of our program, which was built in consultation with a bipartisan workgroup, has been to ensure that rental assistance is provided in an equitable way, with low barriers and a local focus,” said Secretary Kenneth C. Holt. “Our approach means that there is a long-term sustainability to the program, all while evictions are at record lows compared to before the pandemic.” The $135 million represents roughly one-third of the $401.6 million earmarked for the first round of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. The stage agency is administering $258 million through the program, and an additional $143 million is set aside for jurisdictions with populations over 200,000.

During that same period, the number of households served per month increased to 5,100 from 4,400. Six counties—Carroll, Cecil, Frederick, Howard, Prince George’s and Wicomico—have already distributed 50% of their allocations. The housing department said it set aside $20 million for the fastest-spending jurisdictions and will begin allocating those reserve funds in October. A survey from the Maryland Multi-Housing Association found that 17% of renters are behind on multiple months of rent, compared with a high of 42% at the height of the pandemic, the agency said.

Since the pandemic began, there were 532,340 total confirmed cases and 10,212 deaths. There are 3,892,489 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,918,602 doses. Of those, 3,947,972 are first doses with 3,750 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,589,994 second doses, 3,870 in the last day.

A total of 301,237 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 964 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 78,141 additional or booster vaccine doses, 5,945 in the last day. The state reported 83.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state.

In addition to a new game tonight will also feature montages from the last five decades and special guests. CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to Drew Carey about this special celebration, having fans back and how exactly those cars get on stage. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW-  Hello Drew! Nice to see you today and congrats on the big special tonight celebrating 50 years of  The Price Is Right.  Right off the bat what does that number mean to you being a part of a show that’s been on for half a century? DC-  You know, there’s not many TV shows that make it that far and I really have to credit just the structure of the show. I can’t take any credit for this at all, really, except for like carrying the torch and being a good steward, I guess. The better stewards are all the people in the production office that have been there longer than me and have a really invested stake in the show. People really do care a lot about this show that work on it and it really shows in the final product. It’s just really interesting and a great place for me to be when everybody cares so much about putting a good product out and making people happy. They know what a history the show has and they’re taking extra care of it. I don’t know it’s like working at the Washington Monument or something, taking care of this old thing that people treasure. [Laughs] MW-  Well, you’ve been the head caretaker of the Washington Monument for 14 years with that analogy. What are you most proud of from your tenure? DC-  I don’t know, I don’t really think like that. I’m just glad the show still doing well, you know? I know what a team effort it is because I see it behind the scenes. I’m here watching the people behind the camera run in and out when the contestants are coming down setting up the prizes. You know the grips and the crew are pushing cars and racing to plug things in. I don’t know I can’t take pride, I just feel fortunate to work with a crew like that and to work with people like that. I feel a lot of gratitude and I do feel really fortunate and blessed to be in this position. MW-  Good point you never think about how the cars get there… DC-  Oh yea and they’re not allowed to start them on stage because we’re in an enclosed building and we don’t want people to faint, you know, carbon monoxide poisoning. I mean they unhook the batteries  and there’s like a team that pushes the cars around the stage, down a ramp, then outside. It’s really like a big production backstage, it’s crazy, READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn MW-  Especially important now that there are fans in the building again! How much different is it now with people in the crowd? DC-  It was a little weird when we didn’t have any audience at all, but the people that did show up were very enthusiastic and great, so that made it good. It’s much better now though and it’s not a full 300- plus size audience like we had before COVID, but it’s way better and it looks really good. The production team did such a good job putting everything together and making it look good, which was another big accomplishment by them. Things were changing day-to-day you know and whether we’re gonna have a full audience or not we were going to have the show. So yeah, feels a lot better now with people I can talk to and it’s a lot more noise. It was a little more mellow without an audience, like I was just talking to somebody in my living room and now it’s an audience again, so that feels a better. MW-  Glad we’ll have an audience tonight to supply that energy tonight for the 50 year special. What are you most excited for tonight? DC-  There’s a lot of great clips in the show. The rest of the show is a regular show and we’re giving away really good prizes, we have a couple new games that are that are fun. We have a couple of really great celebrity guests that I’m excited about. One of those guests is a secret I’m not allowed to say but it’s a really famous person. There’s so many good clips and moments from the show. The main part of the show is watching all this history. It’s really great to watch just as a TV fan. They showed the clips live in the studio and I was just there with my jaw hitting the floor watching. It’s going to be really fun. MW-   The Price Is Right  is such a big part of TV history and something everyone feels connected to so I’m very excited for the special tonight and congrats to you for your 14 years at the helm keeping that old monument good and shiny. Thanks for the time Drew and all the best moving forward! DC-  Thanks buddy, take care!

(CBS) —  There’s lots of talk surrounding Tom Brady’s much-anticipated game in New England against the Patriots. Brady spoke to the media on Thursday afternoon, but talking was something he was struggling to do himself.   The 44-year-old Buccaneers quarterback gave his weekly press conference for the media in Tampa, and immediately, his raspy voice was startling to hear. Brady has had some on-and-off rasp over the past couple of months, but Thursday certainly sounded like the sickest he’s been.   After answering a few questions, Brady was finally asked about the condition of his throat.   “I don’t know. I’ve had a few of these days. I don’t know what the deal is, so I gotta try to figure this out,” Brady said. “I said my throat’s more tired than arm. Imagine that.”     \"I still have a lot of great friends there, but they know I want to kick their butt this week. They'll know exactly how I'm feeling once I'm out there.\"   🗣️:  @TomBrady   pic.twitter.com/bI1Epvg8bw   — Tampa Bay Buccaneers (@Buccaneers)  September 30, 2021     Brady was reminded by a reporter that he had a similar hoarseness to his voice in the summer. “Same thing — I know,” Brady said. “It came back. I know. Very strange. Something must be a little — I can’t explain that, so.”   Later, when asked if he’ll be having family at the game Sunday night against the Patriots in Foxboro, he joked that perhaps the hectic schedule of the first four weeks of the season has contributed to his condition.   “A lot — first four weeks have been tough on me. The home opener, and then California [last week], Patriots. So after this I’m like, done for the year,” Brady said. “I’m tired of it, so maybe that’s the problem with my voice.”   It’s not the first time that Brady has sounded hoarse before a big game. He was sick in the days leading up to Super Bowl XLIX against the Seahawks. He ended up winning that game, turning in a fourth quarter for the ages to win his first Super Bowl in a decade. So he’s likely not too worried about how his current sore throat will impact his performance on Sunday night at Gillette Stadium.

The action begins on Friday, October 1 when #13 BYU and quarterback Jaren Hall travel to enemy territory to take on Utah State. The Cougars haven’t lost a game yet and have scored at least 20 points in every single game this season. CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith spoke with CBS Sports college football host Brent Stover to get his thoughts on the big time matchup and a whole host of games on Saturday, October 2, which includes an intriguing matchup between two 3-1 teams in Liberty and UAB. Stover explains why he likes BYU on Friday, what Liberty will need to do to win on the road and the expectations for Fresno State in Hawai’i. READ MORE:  ‘The Razorbacks Are Definitely For Real’: CBS’ Kevin Carter Previews #7 Texas A&M Vs. #16 Arkansas, Other Week 4 Games #13 BYU vs. Utah State: Friday, October 1, 9pm EST/PST CBS Sports Network “It’s probably one of the best matchups we’ve had on CBS Sports Network this year,” said Stover. “I like BYU and last year was not a mirage and I think they’ve proven that through the first third of the season. I think the quarterback situation is the big question. It sounds like Jaren Hall was all but ready to go last week. I expect him to start, but Baylor Romney was awesome. He threw for 305 yards and three touchdowns. I think BYU is going to be a little bit too much for Utah State, but the Aggies are off to a great start as well. I think it is going to be a fantastic game, and with home field, it probably evens it out a bit. I would pick BYU in this game.” Western Michigan vs. Buffalo: Saturday, October 2, 12pm EST/PST CBS Sports Network “It’s interesting because Western Michigan is off to a good start, and it’s good to get conference play going in the MAC,” said Stover. “You can kind of wipe the slate clean a little bit for Buffalo, because they’ve been a little bit up and down. They looked terrible against Nebraska and bounced back since then. This is a tough matchup for me to pick as well, but with Buffalo you have to look at that running game. They’re scoring 33 points per game, and that’s second in the MAC. Kevin Marks is back this year with Dylan McDuffie. I think Buffalo has an opportunity perhaps to win the MAC, but this is a big opportunity against Western Michigan to get things going.” READ MORE:  ‘Bryce Young Has Been Outstanding As A First-Year Starter’: CBS’s Brian Jones Previews #1 Alabama Vs. #14 Florida, Other Week 3 Games UCF vs. Navy: Saturday, October 2, 3:30pm EST/PST CBS Sports Network “Navy is just not there. Go back over the last half of last season and the first three games of this season, and it’s hard to pinpoint what might be going on,” said Stover. “Ken Niumatalolo has built such a phenomenal culture there, and all he has done is won games, but something is just not right for them. UCF got that great win to open the year against Boise State, and they have an extra week to prepare coming off that loss to Louisville, and I don’t think Louisville is any slouch. I like Dillon Gabriel. He is one of my favorite quarterbacks in the country. If you look over his career, he wins games, and he is not one who plays down to his competition. He’s thrown 42 touchdowns in 16 conference games with only eight interceptions. He doesn’t make mistakes, and he’s good for the big play and deep ball. I think UCF has a big advantage in this game, even though it is on the road. Liberty vs. UAB: Saturday, October 2, 7pm EST/PST CBS Sports Network “My guy Kevin Carter, who I work with on Fridays and Saturdays, thought Malik Willis should’ve been in the top five for the Heisman last year, and I can’t disagree,” said Stover. “He’s an Auburn transfer, and he played there in 2017 and 2018, and he was phenomenal last year. The beauty of Willis is he is one of these typical dual-threat guys that a lot of people maybe haven’t paid enough attention to because he is at a school like Liberty. He’s only run for 274 yards and four touchdowns this year, and he’s already thrown for over 800 yards and 10 touchdowns and no interceptions. The guy doesn’t make mistakes. They came up just short last time out, and they’re 3-1. With UAB, we know what Bill Clark has done there, and this is a brand new stadium. These folks have been waiting for a long time, and this program was dead. Not only is it back and not only are they contending for conference titles, but they’ve got an incredible downtown stadium in Birmingham. I think it is going to go down to the wire. This one is tough to pick for me, but it’s going to be exciting. And I think there are going to be a lot of points and a lot of yards. These are two really exciting teams to watch.” #18 Fresno State vs. Hawai’i: Saturday, October 2, 10:30pm EST/PST CBS Sports Network “What fascinates me is that when you go to Hawai’i, it’s not a foregone conclusion just because of the trip,” said Stover. “That’s just the way that it is. One advantage that the Warriors have is they’ve already played five games. They could be tired, but playing at home and having five games under your belt gives you the advantage there. Jake Haener is one of the best quarterbacks in the country. Not only did he beat UCLA with a game-winning drive, but he showed toughness on the field with a hurt left side the whole time. Last week they were a little bit sluggish in the first half, but then in the second half we saw what they can do. I’m not as concerned with the UNLV game as a lot of people might be. It’s human nature to have a letdown, and Fresno State had that letdown. But the bottom line is they won the game. They’re 4-1, and their only loss is to a top three team in Oregon. This Fresno State team for my money — and I think Nevada and Boise State might have something to say about that — Fresno State is the best team in the Mountain West. Right now outside of Cincinnati, I would pick them to be the best Group of Five team.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.11613518186794049, "subjectivity": 0.3993413195999401, "wordcount": 1127}

READ MORE:  'I Like BYU & Last Year Was Not A Mirage': CBS Sports' Brent Stover Previews #13 BYU Vs. Utah State, Other Week 5 Games Boise State vs Utah State: Saturday, September 25 at 12pm EST/PST CBS “The good thing about the losses Boise State has sustained is that they are not in the conference,” said Carter. “It beefs up Mountain West play when you are able to go out and take on someone from the American in UCF. They lost that game, but it was a great game. It was good for them to show well. Non-conference games won’t hurt you, especially early in the year, but now this is a conference matchup that really behooves them to get out and make some noise.” “The biggest thig is Boise State has to find a way to control the line of scrimmage and get the ball into George Holani’s hands. They have been able to score a lot of points thus far this season, and they haven’t really been stopped. They need to control the football and not give it to Logan Bonner and the Utah State offense. He has two really good receivers in Deven Thompkins and Brandon Bowling and both have had 100 yard receiving games in the last two weeks. They will have their work cut out for them from a pass defense standpoint. They’re definitely ready.” #16 Arkansas vs. #7 Texas A&M: Saturday, September 25, at 3:30pm EST/PST CBS “I think the Razorbacks are definitely for real,” said Carter. “Early when they had a matchup with Texas, I think we saw what they were really able to accomplish. You are going to have your work cut out for you just from the presence of a dual-threat quarterback. You are going to have to account for the quarterback run, but also just the big play. Arkansas quarterback KJ Jefferson makes huge plays coming out of this offense. They are coming out of the read option fakes and his versatility and ability to be a weapon at the quarterback position.” “I think Texas A&M’s offense is really a work in progress,” said Carter. “Not having Kellen Mond and having Haynes King go down with an injury, you’re looking at a young quarterback in Zach Calzada. He seems to be getting better and better. The advantage of having a young quarterback in this offense is Jimbo Fisher’s offense is all they know. The fact that you got Isaiah Spiller as a running back and what was the SEC’s best defense last season also is a plus. Whoever’s defense comes to play is going to tell the story of who wins.” READ MORE:  'Bryce Young Has Been Outstanding As A First-Year Starter': CBS's Brian Jones Previews #1 Alabama Vs. #14 Florida, Other Week 3 Games UNLV vs. Fresno State: Friday, September 24 at 10pm EST/PST  CBS Sports Network “Fresno State has to go out there and play like they haven’t been winning,” said Carter. “Fresno State has been nothing short of impressive. There is always someone that surprises you. Jake Haener and the offense are averaging over 400 yards of passing. When I saw that against Oregon and then Oregon went on to beat Ohio State. You knew they were better than Cal Poly and not as good as Oregon, that is a wide range to be between. They are physical, and it’s not about UNLV, it’s about not letting themselves down. UNLV is currently on a nine-game losing streak.” Miami Ohio vs. Army: Saturday, September 25 12pm EST/PST CBS Sports Network “It’s about the bread and butter for how each team makes their hay,” said Carter. “The thing about Miami Ohio is their offense is pretty potent. They had a win last weekend and 523 yards of total offense in that game. They won the game by 35 points, and this offense is just potent and they will try to possess the football. The quarterback Brett Gabbert completed 10 of his 16 passes, had two touchdowns and an interception. This is a high-powered offense that will put up a lot of yards. Army is one of those teams that no matter how well you are playing, if you can’t get yourself off the field, they’re going to grind it out. They’re going to get their yards, and that triple option is the great equalizer. They are coming off an impressive win against UConn. Miami Ohio has to do a great job of maintaining the football, because Army will look to grind you out and limit possessions. They look to win the battle in time of possession and decrease your opportunities to score points.” Wyoming vs. UConn: Saturday, September 25 3:30pm EST/PST CBS Sports Network “Wyoming has to control the football and run downhill,” said Carter. “UConn is having all kinds of trouble. You have to go out and control the line of scrimmage, and sometimes when you are playing teams that have trouble maintaining the football or making anything happen, you have to guard against everything because they have nothing to lose. UConn will come in and throw everything they have. Wyoming’s quarterback Sean Chambers is off to a fast start, and they have to run the football with Xazavian Valladay.” Indiana vs. Western Kentucky: Saturday, September 25 at 8pm EST/PST “For Indiana, this is really an opportunity to get back on track,” said Carter. “They had really high expectations coming into the season. Michael Penix Jr. is coming off a surgery and a season where their defense played out of its mind. Last year, they led the Big 10 in quarterback sacks and interceptions. This was a defense that really made a lot happen. Indiana’s offense had a lot of opportunities. This is one of those trap games. The first two weeks started out a little rocky for Indiana. They have an opportunity now to get themselves back on track with a win against Western Kentucky. They lost to the #5 and #8 teams in the country. This is a get-right game and a reset and getting themselves back to maintaining the football. Western Kentucky will not roll over.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.2233882428940569, "subjectivity": 0.3993484680693982, "wordcount": 1130}

In between, the Minnesota Vikings appear to be rounding into form, while the Chicago Bears are falling apart. At least that’s how things look from Week 3 in the NFL. The Packers needed a last-minute drive and a last-second field goal to secure their second win. The Lions dropped their third, when the Baltimore Ravens beat them the same way. The Vikings put together a complete effort to overcome the Seattle Seahawks. But the Bears were over overwhelmed by the superior Cleveland Browns.

Green Bay draws a battered and struggling Pittsburgh team. The Vikings host the Cleveland Browns, who are coming off another strong showing. And the Bears and Lions try to avoid the division cellar. CBS Chicago sports director Marshall Harris looks at the three NFC North matchups. All times listed are Eastern. Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Cleveland Browns @ Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, October 3 @ 1:00 p.m. The Browns are coming off a dominating 26-6 win over the Bears to improve their record to 2-1. The defense gave rookie quarterback Justin Fields fits in his first NFL start, sacking him nine times and knocking him down 15 times. Myles Garrett alone had 4.5 sacks, setting a franchise record. The Browns limited the Bears to a little over one yard per offensive play. While the Browns deserve credit for the win — not to mention downing the Houston Texans to open the season and almost knocking off the Kansas City Chiefs in the opener — it’s still a little unclear how good this Cleveland team is. “I think we’re looking at a situation where the Browns are good,” Harris conceded. “But I don’t know how good they are, because I just saw them play a Bears team that looked like they had no clue what was going on on the football field on the offensive end.” The Browns, on the other hand, have a good sense of what they want to do with the ball. And that is hand it to Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt. The two combined for 165 yards on the ground on 32 carries. Mayfield continued to run the offense efficiently. And Odell Beckham Jr. returned to the lineup, hauling in five passes for another 77 yards. The Vikings are coming off a strong performance of their own, topping the Seattle Seahawks 30-17. Quarterback Kirk Cousins continued to look comfortable in the pocket, tossing three touchdowns passes in the first half and ultimately completing 30-38 for 323 yards. Running Back Dalvin Cook sat out with an ankle injury, but Alexander Mattison put up 112 yards on 26 carries and caught six passes for 59 yards out of the backfield on a busy afternoon. “I’m interested to see if Kirk Cousins can really say they’ve made a move to doing more positive things,” Harris said. “I think this is going to be a tightly contested game. It’s a real proving ground for the Browns to go on the road to try to beat Minnesota. But I really believe that the Vikings are going to win this game, somehow, some way in a tight one.” Detroit Lions @ Chicago Bears, Sunday, October 3 @ 1:00 p.m. READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University The Bears were embarrassed by the Browns in Week 3, at least on offense, where they couldn’t do anything. They held their own on defense, sacking Baker Mayfield five times and holding Cleveland to 10 points in the first half. They’ll have an easier matchup when they host the winless Lions in Week 4. But nothing about the Bears so far inspires confidence. That starts at quarterback, where injuries have created a potential revolving door. “I don’t know who the Bears are going to start at quarterback,” Harris admitted. “We’re told by Matt Nagy that they don’t know who the Bears are going to start a quarterback. Of course it depends on the injury to Andy Dalton, who missed last week with a knee injury. And Justin Fields, if you take nine sacks, you might get hit a few times, in a way that you don’t want to. He’s got a dinged-up hand, so we’ll see how that shakes out. Nick Foles, you know, Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles, could be the starter for the Bears after being your third-string quarterback to start the season. We’ll just have to see how the injuries play out.” Whoever it is will need some help. The Bears offense put up a measly 114 yards last week, and that’s before netting out sacks and penalties. A lot of that burden falls on coaches putting their players in a position to succeed. And that didn’t happen last week. “Matt Nagy says he doesn’t want to reveal who is going to call plays,” Harris said. “It probably should not be him. Expect Bill Lazor, the offensive coordinator, to take over the play-calling. If he doesn’t, Matt Nagy could very well be coaching for his job. Not that he’ll get fired next week, but for all intents and purposes, this could be his last go-round with the Bears, if they lose to a winless Detroit Lions team.” The Lions lost to the Baltimore Ravens last week in maybe the most heartbreaking way possible. Jared Goff drove Detroit well into field goal range in the game’s final minutes, allowing them to take the lead with a field goal. But Lamar Jackson brought his Ravens back just far enough for Justin Tucker to kick a record-setting 66-yard game-winning field goal. Lost in the excitement is that the Lions were able to stay with the Ravens and could easily have won. Baltimore moved the ball, but the Detroit defense largely contained Jackson and mostly kept the Ravens out of the end zone. Jared Goff was an efficient 22-30 for 217 yards. The Lions can probably expect another close one in Chicago. “That’s not how they want to end the game,” Harris said of the Lions’ loss. “But with the Bears, we don’t even know where they’re going to start, or more specifically, who they’re going to start. But I think, because it is a home game, the Bears find a way to eke this one out. And I do mean eke it out, 13-10.” Pittsburgh Steelers @ Green Bay Packers, Sunday, October 3 @ 4:25 p.m. The Steelers and Packers seem to be heading in opposite directions. The Steelers looked lifeless in losing 24-10 to a Cincinnati Bengals team that’s long been the AFC North punching bag. The Packers looked just the opposite, coming back to knock off the San Francisco 49ers with a walk-off field goal. Ben Roethlisberger completed 38 passes for 318 yards, but mostly of the short variety. Najee Harris hauled in 14 of them out of the backfield. The running game was non-existent behind a makeshift offensive line that couldn’t get out of its own way. Big Ben was sacked four times and knocked down five more. “Here in Chicago, we know a little thing or two about 39-year-old future Hall of Famers trying to hold on to that last bit of glory,” Harris said. “That’s what’s going on right now under center for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ben Roethlisberger is washed. I think I can say that with a degree of confidence and the tape will bear that out. The thing is can Mike Tomlin and the Steelers do anything about it to have them win more football games?” It won’t be easy against a Packers team firing on all cylinders. That starts with Aaron Rodgers, who after a dud of a game to open the season, is back to his old ways. Rodgers completed 23 passes for 253 yards, two TDs and a passer rating of 113.3. He found Adams a total of 12 times for 132 yards. Aaron Jones averaged an effective 4.3 yards per carry on his 19 carries. The defense pushed around Jimmy Garoppolo, sacking him four times and hitting him 11 more. MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts The Packers are favored by a touchdown, but it may not end up that close. “I think he (Rodgers) is going to be in a position where he maybe throws the ball 25 times at the most, goes for three or four touchdowns and they cruise in this game,” said Harris. “I’m going to say 31-10, giving Pittsburgh the benefit of doubt that somehow, some way they get into the end zone. But this one has all the potential to get ugly, because like I said, Ben Roethlisberger doesn’t look like he should be still playing in the NFL.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.13471350408850405, "subjectivity": 0.439355309042809, "wordcount": 1516}

Utah State, Other Week 5 Games “I’m anxious to see if these quarterbacks for Florida, who have just been turning up in the first two games,” said Jones. “Florida is averaging 381 yards on the ground, and they’ve gone from the number one passing offense to the number one rushing offense in the early part of the season. Can those quarterbacks do that against tougher competition, which Alabama is going to bring to bear. On the flip side, their defense lost a lot of luster in the Swamp. This will be a major test for them, going up against Bryce Young, who has been outstanding as a first-year starter and all those wide receivers he has at his beck and call. Can this Gator defense reclaim some of the glory of years past.” Meanwhile, it’s been a rough start to the season for the UConn Huskies. They are 0-3, and Randy Edsall resigned as head coach. Their opponent on Saturday is Army, who has not lost a game this year and is coming off an impressive performance against Western Kentucky. Jones likes what the Black Knights can do on the ground in this game. “You should look for another beatdown for UConn,” said Jones. “It hasn’t been going good is an under statement. They are about as rotten as an open grave. Army had a fantastic win last week against Western Kentucky. Army was actually passing on the Hilltoppers. They opened up the game with touchdown passes and that loosened up that front and then they were able to do what they do best in run the rock. They are going to run through UConn like running water.” At 3:30pm ET on Saturday, CBS Sports Network will feature an intriguing matchup between SMU & Louisiana Tech. SMU has a bigtime offense, but Jones thinks Louisiana Tech will be ready to put up a good fight in this one. READ MORE:  'The Razorbacks Are Definitely For Real': CBS' Kevin Carter Previews #7 Texas A&M Vs. #16 Arkansas, Other Week 4 Games “Louisiana Tech is going to be a tough out, they always are,” said Jones. “SMU likes to chuck it around and Sonny Dykes also wants some balance. He likes to run the rock and also be physical in the trenches. We’ll see if they accomplish that. Skip Holtz has the same mindset. He teaches a physical brand of football, so it should be pretty exciting.” On Saturday night, Utah, out of the Pac-12, will look to rebound after a loss to BYU with a road game against San Diego State. The Aztecs just went to the University of Arizona and took down the Wildcats 38-14, and that proved to Jones that they are not afraid of anyone. “San Diego State is not afraid of the Pac-12,” said Jones. “I think they’ve won their last four or five versus Pac-12 schools, including last weekend against Arizona. Utah has to pick up the pieces after losing to their rival BYU. They didn’t block well upfront, and they weren’t as physical as Kyle Whittingham teams usually are. They have to find that game again as far as winning in the trenches. If they can do that, I think they win. San Diego State wants to run the ball. Greg Bell and others in that backfield run downhill and straight at you. I think, if you can stop them and force San Diego State to pass the ball, Utah has a good chance of winning the ball game. But don’t sleep on Aztecs.” The night of college football on CBS Sports Network wraps up with a bigtime matchup between #14 Iowa State and UNLV. The Cyclones lost by 10 to the rival Iowa Hawkeyes last week and will be looking to get it together against a UNLV team that has yet to win a game in 2021. Jones thinks this is just what the doctor ordered for Iowa State. “Iowa State was out-physicaled last week verses their rival Iowa,” said Jones. “Iowa offensively didn’t have a ton of yardage, but they benefited from the turnovers. Interceptions, fumbles and that defense was just incredible going up against Breece Hall and Brock Purdy. UNLV has been competitive in the early part of the season, and they’re 0-2. And I believe Matt Campbell will have his team ready and get that bad taste out of their mouth and get a much needed win on the road.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.142781432748538, "subjectivity": 0.4321376357560567, "wordcount": 927}

(WJZ)  — The Anne Arundel County Health Department on Thursday said it is recommending fully vaccinated students and school staff who are asymptomatic will not have to quarantine after a close contact, in accordance with new CDC guidelines. Under the suggested protocols, fully vaccinated close contacts should get tested three to five days after being exposed to COVID-19, the agency said. But students and staff without symptoms can continue to attend school in-person and participate in other activities.

The school system started with quarantine protocols requiring that students and staff stay at home for 14 days after a possible exposure, but the guideline was eventually reduced to 10 days, said Mosier. Under the new recommendations from the health department, students and staff would only have to quarantine for a week if they test negative five to seven days after a possible exposure. Kalyanaraman urged parents of students age 12 or older to have their children get vaccinated if they want to stay in the classroom and participate in sports.

READ MORE:  ‘Survivor 41’: Episode 2 Recap: Introducing A New Advantage! MW-  Hello David! Sorry we’re talking a lot earlier than you had probably hope but you’re still part of a very small group of group who even get to the island so I hope you’re still proud of that. What was your reaction to setting foot on that island and living out a dream? DV-  So for me and several other people we were cast before COVID And then that all fell through and so to finally be out there, there was just this overwhelming excitement. Especially after COVID and quarantining and finally being free to be around people. You can feel just the the vibe, even from the crew, everyone was just so excited to be out there. I lived a dream, even thought five days was way too short, it’s crazy how much of those five days are permanently seared into my memory now. It was just such an incredible experience and coming back and trying to describe it to people is hard. It’s literally like a drug where you get this high of being out there and then it’s taken away. I feel like I need the next hit, it’s just an incredible adventure, a once-in-a-lifetime adventure and I’m really grateful for it. MW-  That’s a very unique thing like you said, being on the show during COVID. Obviously it’s far from everyday life but was there any sense of normalcy that at the very least you could be around people again? DV-   Survivor  is not normal at all. [Laughs] Before going out there a lot of people would say Jeff has that line of it’s going to rock you to your core and people talk about mental health and it’s all true. We were on an island, it’s 24/7 non-stop living with people from all different walks of life, all different backgrounds, and being able to kind of create a society together. Those taglines that we hear over and over again, that really is what it is. You know you don’t have the cell phones, computers, the work schedules everything that all goes out the window. It’s this weird society that’s happening, you go out there and it’s just this incredible microcosm that happens. It’s kind of mind boggling how quickly you fall into this small society that you’re creating. It really just kind of teaches you what’s important in life, and kind of resets your mind, how to kind of approach life. MW-  Even things like not knowing what time it is, I imagine that has to really throw you for a loop? DV-  The hardest part is waking up in the middle of the night. You feel pretty rested so you think it must be close to morning and then like 10 hours go by and it’s still dark out. You realize ok maybe it was only like 7pm. [Laughs] MW-  You also got to experience a few challenges, so walk me through what that’s like when you step up to that starting line? DV-  Yeah, I mean it’s adrenaline rush. You just have complete adrenaline pushing you through those challenges. It’s hard to describe how intense those challenges are. Everything is so heavy, everything is so intense. You know that sweat challenge was way underrated, we almost didn’t finish, that was one of the hardest things I’ve done in my life. Our thighs were bloody from the chafing, we had scars all over the place. We were just completely wiped out. READ MORE:  Eric Abraham Proud To Represent His Family On Survivor Despite Early Exit: ‘It Was A Great Experience, I Just Didn’t See It Coming’ So what you see on TV, just know it’s way harder. You think ‘oh I can do that, that’d be fun’ and then you get out there and it’s a totally different ballgame. You do have time to strategize, but it’s not a lot. So in that last challenge, the water challenge, you saw me in my underwear because I was supposed to actually swim and then last minute Tiffany said she could do the beam and they wanted me on a puzzle because I could do puzzles. So everything just kind of is happening the way it happens because everything’s moving so fast. It’s incredible the out there but it’s also like, I’ve got to perform. MW-  And also like you said you’re doing it on not the best night’s sleep and very little food, so you’re mind isn’t really where it needs to be either I assume. DV-  Exactly, yeah. The best example of it is Tiffany last night, love her to death but what in the world happened? I mean she just lost all touch with reality. What you saw was Liana be like this is idiotic, and Evie being like what is happening? Evie told Deshawn that Xander is going home, he has these idols and that’s why she told him everything. What you didn’t really see is when Evie got back from that trek she only had about five minutes with us, and that’s why she was like wait what, why does Tiffany, want to do this? But there was no time and I think if there had been even a little more time Evie would have said, then let’s split the vote. Let’s do a two-one vote so that we can still get out Xander and if he plays something then Voce will go. So it just did not make sense, and you see that and Tiffany saying I don’t have any food I’m not thinking straight and just the paranoia and complete lack of any sense that set in. MW-  So when you are staring down that moment and you realize you might be going home, what was that moment like for you? DV-  Honestly, that was such a blindside. I knew as soon as the first vote was read and it was my vote for Tiffany I was like uh-oh. You never want to see your vote first. That’s kind of when I realized that and honestly, it was just devastation. After you get voted out it’s kind of a whirlwind and you’re sitting there getting your final thoughts and this was a total blindside. I said at the time I guess it was my relationship maintenance but I actually take that back a little. At that point I just felt like I was close to people, I thought I had real bonds with people, and I did have those bonds with people. It’s just that when stuff hit the fan, I didn’t actually realize that stuff was hitting the fan. I don’t think that that was a lack of self awareness, I think it was just a pure moment of Russian roulette mayhem. There were so many advantages, there were so many twists, it was just like this huge cluster. It was just a matter of where does the bullet go and it went for me, which sucks but that’s  Survivor  and that’s life MW-  Well hopefully we see you back out there sometime, like I said you still made it to the island which is a huge accomplishment in its own right. You handled yourself well out there and it was great catching up with you today! DV-  Thanks Matt, take care!

For precisely 497 days,  Survivor  was off the air – and man, does it feel good to have my Wednesday night ritual back! Did you miss last night’s episode? Don’t worry, I got you covered! Here’s what went down…   Photo Courtesy of CBS   READ MORE:  ‘Survivor 41’ Episode 1 Recap: Two Eliminations, One Summit This season is taking us into the game like never before!  Survivor 41  has pulled back its curtain, giving us viewers a glimpse of what it’s really like to create this incredible show! Host Jeff Probst, went LIVE on the  @CBS  TikTok Tuesday night to give us an inside scoop of how hard these producers hustle… and from watching last night’s footage, you can tell! Ua Tribe Right off the bat, we open the episode on this intense scene of Brad, the hunter and rancher from Wyoming. Brad is still apprehensive about what exactly went down at the last Tribal Council. He feels he can’t trust J.D. since he was a complete wild card at the previous vote. So, when Brad noticed both J.D. and Ricard going off to get some water together, he immediately sprinted. Brad dashed around the entire camp to secretly hideout and spy on the two (similar to  Survivor  two-time winner Tony Vlacho’s spy shack), and listened in on what was said. Behind the scenes on Tuesday night’s TikTok LIVE, Probst shared how the camera crew had to be so discrete on filming this fast, adrenaline-rushed scene. Just watching it on T.V., we don’t always realize what it takes to get the shot – and this scene in particular just goes to show how talented (and in shape) the production crew really is! Luckily, Brad got back to camp without getting caught… or did he? Since Brad made a pretty impulsive scene, Shan, the pastor on the tribe, started to question if she could really trust Brad in the game. So, what does she do? She, of course, tells Ricard how Brad spied on them. Good move for Shan? Eh… time will tell. Luvu Tribe The Luvu tribe are off to a great start this season. Without going to Tribal Council yet, this tribe is still six strong. One stand-out so far is Naseer, who we got to learn much more about in this episode. Naseer impresses his tribe right away, as his survival skills are shining. As he effortlessly makes a fire, we get to see a little inside peek at what makes Naseer, Naseer. On the premiere, we learned he actually, in fact, learned the English language by watching this show,  Survivor . He comes from Sri Lanka, where his whole life led him to craft essential survival skills necessary for his life then – and for his life here now in the game of  Survivor . Naseer is showing he’s an essential asset to his tribe – but will his skillset be enough to keep him long in the game?   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Yase Tribe Meanwhile, the Yase tribe is up to all sorts of strategies. Even though it’s only day 4 in the game, this tribe is exhausted. After voting out Abraham at the first Tribal Council, alliances are becoming clear. Evvie, who’s been in the middle of it all, has been working a solid social game for herself. She’s been in a three-way alliance with Voce and Xander… as well as Liana and Tiffany. Yep, this girl is working everyone! On one hand, Evvie feels like she can strongly trust keeping a female alliance with the two other women. However, Evvie’s also workin’ these men who are giving her some vital info… Xander, who received an extra vote at the last  Survivor  Summit, also found the new “Beware Advantage.” This Beware Advantage is exactly how it sounds – an advantage with risk. After searching through the jungle and ultimately finding it, Xander had the choice whether or not he wanted to risk opening this ‘said’ advantage. He decides to risk it and receives the advantage… but, there’s a catch. This “Beware Advantage” is a 3-way shared Immunity Idol – a brand new element to the game. However, this Immunity Idol can only be in-effect if each advantage is found at every camp. That means there are still two other advantages hidden at both the Ua and Luvu camps. The thing is, the only way Xander will know if the other advantages are found is if all the “secret phrases” are announced. Yes, you read that right – secret phrases. At the next Immunity Challenge, Xander must say his secret phrase to sign to the other tribes. His secret phrase is: “I truly believe that butterflies are just dead relatives saying hi.” … just when you thought  Survivor  couldn’t be more creative! Yep, and that’s not all. If the other two tribes haven’t found their advantages, then Xander cannot vote… until all three are finally found! What a twist. Immunity Challenge and Reward The castaways were competing for both immunity and reward at this challenge! The first TWO tribes to win not only got immunity from Tribal Council, but they’d each win some fishing gear, (the first place tribe would be rewarded with more equipment). READ MORE:  Sara Wilson Reacts To ‘Worst Case Scenario’ After Early Survivor Elimination: ‘Given Me So Much Fire On The Inside’ But first, Xander snuck in his secret phrase to indicate he received his tribe’s “Beware Advantage.” And, it was clear – no other advantages have been found:   Well that was awkward…😳🦋  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/3rxtOQkVuD   — SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  September 30, 2021 …cue the cricket sound effects. The challenge itself was exhausting, especially for Yase tribe member Tiffany. After navigating herself through a series of swimming-based obstacles, Tiffany was pretty spent. She moved slowly on the balance beam portion of the challenge and cost her tribe immunity – allowing both the Luvu and Ua tribes to win. But, before heading out – since the Luvu tribe came in first, they had to decide which person from the losing Yase tribe would be sent to the ‘unknown’  Survivor  Summit. Luvu chose Evvie to go. They then had to choose one other person to go with Evvie, which could include someone from the Luvu tribe itself. Without hesitation, Deshawn stepped up and offered to go to the Summit as well. Was it a smart move?   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Survivor  Summit As we’ve seen during last week’s premiere, the  Survivor  Summit is an unknown place that can include any twists. Since Evvie knew what went down from Xander’s experience, she felt she had the upper hand. Knowing she didn’t want to risk her vote, she tells Deshawn that he can go ahead and risk his vote to gain the extra vote advantage. This creates trust between both Deshawn and Evvie as they’re trekking along, getting to know one another. As Evvie knows, Xander has not one but two advantages in his pocket already on day 4. Xander thinks he can trust Evvie – but we’ve seen how Evvie is attempting to work with everyone – and that now includes Deshawn. While Deshawn and her are alone at the Summit, Evvie continues to share more vital information – hoping she can now ally with him. Evvie then starts to blab all of the secrets she holds with Xander and how he has this new “Beware Advantage.” Remind you, giving an entirely different tribe member information is extremely risky in the game… even  Survivor  winner (and  Survivor  legend), Boston Rob, had something to say about the way she’s playing:   Loose lips sink ships!  @survivorcbs   — Boston Rob (@BostonRob)  September 30, 2021 Simply put: Evvie sharing this info to Deshawn could be either incredibly smart or incredibly dumb for her future in this game! …Or, perhaps both? We’ll see!   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Tribal Council After her brutal performance at the Immunity Challenge, Tiffany came back to her tribe with all sorts of excuses for what went wrong. Both Voce and Xander didn’t like this. Because of her lack of strength, they were confident about voting her out. But, let’s not forget, Xander now can’t vote! He has to wait until the other two Beware Advantages are found until he can vote again. This is a massive disadvantage for Xander, but he feels secure in his alliance with Evvie and Voce to help persuade Liana to vote out Tiffany. However, since Evvie is playing both sides, she shares all of Xander’s business with Liana and Tiffany. Since there was a lot of info to give, which included Xander’s secret phrase and the fact he can’t vote, Tiffany got pretty confused. So confused, she starts panicking to both Liana and Evvie, coming up with all sorts of “what if” scenarios. In  Survivor , it’s hard to trust people, especially those who don’t listen carefully or get paranoid early on. As Tiffany showed some insecurity, Evvie and Liana  began to question whether they aligned with the right person. But in the end, to keep Tiffany at ease, instead of Xander, the women took out Voce, as he was the third person voted out on this season of  Survivor .   Photo Courtesy of CBS   I think it’s safe to say,  Survivor 41  is pretty unpredictable.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW-  Hey Xavier, so tell me how’d it feel to wake up today with a whole lot more money in your pocket? XP-  Good day, might be an understatement. [Laughs] It’s a good feeling, you put in a lot of work and for it all to pay off, and to be a part of history is something special. MW-  Back in the real world you’re an attorney, do you feel like those skills helped you out on  Big Brother ? XP-  Absolutely. I felt like the skill set that you have when you are an attorney was ideal for the  Big Brother  house. Working as an attorney or just in the legal community, everyone knows that your network is huge, not only your ability to work well with others but your ability to incentivize others to want to work with you. I was able to translate some of those skills and some of the networking skills into the  Big Brother  house to give myself a strong social game to position myself well in the house, not only within The Cookout but also outside. MW-  I’m sure you mentally prepared as best as you could but when you first stepped foot in the house, what’s that moment like? XP-  Oh, when I first stepped foot in the house, I was like, yes, there’s another bald black guy and I’m gonna be the only one sweating up storm, just fantastic [laughs]. But everything else, yeah it was a lot to take in. MW-  [Laughs] And what’s the experience having your life be live streamed 24/7? XP-  In a sense, and I think a lot of the other house guests will reiterate this as well, it’s just kind of like you have to be yourself. We all had to be ourselves, we’re all human, I’m sure we’ll all make mistakes, I’m sure we’ll all do things that we’ll watch and be like Ah that was cringe. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn We were cast on the show because of who we are though and I think showing that through the live feeds is a unique experience. You see the good, you see the bad. The good you love and the bad you try to learn from. MW-  Is there any acclamation getting back to regular life now or does it feel like there’s still a camera pointed at you? Except for right now where there is literally still a camera pointed at you [laughs]. XP-  [Laughs] Right. Yeah, like I mean for the first 20 minutes when I got my phone back I was trying to figure out how to hack into it because I had forgotten my passcode. I found out the Milwaukee Bucks won the NBA Finals, that was great. I’m playing catch up right now and I feel like a caveman. It’s a lot. I’ve really got to get reacclimated with the world. MW-  What do you take from this experience now, aside from the $750,000? XP-  First and foremost that I’ve made bonds with people that I will absolutely cherish forever. Secondly, I think what we’ve proven this season is that when people come together with the same goal in mind they can accomplish historic things, incredible feats. I think the cookout proved that. So for future alliances or just people in general, I think when people come together and really set their mind to doing something they can accomplish just about anything, MW-  Absolutely, well thank you for the time today Xavier. You played a great game and congratulations! XP-  I appreciate it, take care.

The conference focuses on dealing with trauma kids may be experiencing after enduring the coronavirus pandemic, the battle against systemic racism and ongoing violence in the community. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The goal is to prevent children from experiencing negative long-term effects from trauma. “Interesting enough, three kids can witness the same homicide and two children may have coping skills to handle that experience and the third child may not and may feel a great impact, so trauma is not all the same,” Kennedy Krieger Center for Child and Family Traumatic Stress Director of Training Danielle Gregg said. “It doesn’t fit into the same box in the same way. There are many different interventions and approaches that can help a child or family handle that trauma.” Many families in Maryland and across the country are struggling with how to talk to their children about everything that is going on in the world right now. “It’s just rough,” Baltimore resident Herman Woody Lee said. “I just hope things switch around and we can get back to somewhat normal.” Parents WJZ spoke with like Herman Woody Lee said it’s been tough.

It will help. We understand better. We can help others understand better.” Kennedy Krieger’s conference wraps up Friday.

(AP)  — It’s the type of game Maryland has been striving for as the Terrapins have rebuilt their program under coach Michael Locksley. A top-five opponent in town–for a nationally televised night game between two undefeated teams. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “To have all the eyes that we possibly can have following the University of Maryland, not just the football program, I think you can’t pay for these marketing dollars,” Locksley said Tuesday. “Hopefully people are able to take notice that we’re building a football brand, but we’ve got an academic brand and we’ve got great people and we’ve got a great location that should continue to be showcased.” Maryland’s home game Friday night against No. 5 Iowa should indeed be a big event for the school as a whole. The Terrapins have come up short against tough competition before under Locksley, but this time there’s reason to think the Terps are more ready to compete. Maryland is 4-0 for the first time since 2016, and a victory over the Hawkeyes would give the Terrapins their first 5-0 start since 2001. Maryland’s most recent win over a top-five team was against Florida State in 2004. “If we do things the right way up through the game and we play to our standard, then it’s another win that earns another opportunity to have another big game the following week,” Locksley said. The following week, the Terps play at Ohio State. Maryland is unbeaten entering this exciting stretch because it beat West Virginia and Illinois in close games. A victory this week would give the Terps their first 2-0 record in Big Ten play since joining the league before the 2014 season. Locksley made light of Maryland’s relatively short history in the conference when discussing the challenge of preparing during a short week. The Illinois game two weeks ago was also on a Friday night. “I guess we’re still the new kids on the block with having to play two Friday night games in back-to-back weeks almost,” said Locksley, who is in his third season as Maryland’s coach. “At some point, we can get full membership to where we may not have to do this, and make my life a little easier.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn But playing on Friday has its benefits. The Maryland-Iowa game will be on Fox Sports 1 on a night when the college football schedule is less crowded. “Super excited, being that again it is a Friday night game,” receiver Brian Cobbs said. “We haven’t had this opportunity since like high school, if you really think back to it. We’re very excited. We know Terp Nation is going to come out and kind of just enhance the excitement level.” The reason Maryland looks like a threat to pull off an upset this week is because of Cobbs, his fellow receivers, and the Maryland passing game in general. Taulia Tagovailoa leads the Big Ten with 1,340 yards passing this season. He has also completed 75.5% of his passes with 10 touchdowns and one interception. The Terps have room for improvement, though. Last weekend, they allowed 458 yards of offense in a win over Kent State. Penalties and turnovers were also concerns in that game. Locksley has stressed the need for Maryland to play to a certain standard and not worry too much about who the opponent is. He also said the Terrapins should remain focused on the process, working hard during the week so that they can enjoy the games. “Fun is the game day. Fun is when we get to go play,” he said. “Game day is where it’s time to encourage our players, build them up, support them. If I’ve got to act like a maniac on game day, that means I didn’t do it enough Monday through Friday.” Although the preparation might be difficult and the game will be challenging, punter Anthony Pecorella summed up the mood of the Maryland program right now. “We’re definitely excited. It’s going to be a great environment,” Pecorella said. “Excited to put all our product on film for the whole country to see.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

But when an innocent person is exonerated, victims of crimes and their loved ones are left to wonder, “Who is the real criminal?” READ MORE:  ‘I Spent 36 Years In Prison For A Crime I Didn’t Commit’: City State’s Attorney Office Talks About Program That Helps To Overturn Wrongful Convictions Jennifer Thompson knows what it feels like to be a survivor of a heinous crime, only to find out later the man she thought raped her was innocent. “A DNA test was run and it showed not only that it had never been Ronald Cotton but it had actually been a man who was serving time in the same prison as he was. A man by the name of Bobby Poole who had assaulted and raped me and a second woman on the same night, then was left out in the streets to commit further harms,” said Thompson, the founder of  Healing Justice. Thompson said she knew there had to be other people like her out there, so she started the nonprofit organization to help victims after they found out the wrong person was arrested in their case. Now, the group  provides support to people whose lives have been impacted by wrongful convictions . “It’s so many layers of harm and trauma and grief that are family members in these cases, these original victims have to unfold,” said Thompson. Healing Justice holds retreats where victims of crimes, families who’ve lost loved ones and even people who were wrongfully convicted can all come together for a space to heal. READ MORE:  Baltimore Man Cleared Of Murder Decades Later: ‘You Can’t Give Up’ “One of the biggest harms that happens in wrongful conviction cases is we feel like we are the only people that have experienced this, so it’s very isolating,” she said. “But when you realize that there’s a group of people who care and have lived and survived a similar experience, it doesn’t feel as lonely, you feel like there are people out there that you can talk to.” Ten local men have been released from prison after further review found they were wrongfully convicted, according to figures provided by the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office. The agency is now working with Healing Justice to help victims of crimes who thought they had closure only to realize it was a mirage. “You’re not alone, and there’s many of us out there,” Thompson said. “For every wrongful conviction there’s a crime survivor or murder victim’s family member, so you’re not alone. And I would really encourage them to look at Healing Justice.” On Saturday, Oct. 2, a town hall will be held from 1 to 3 p.m. at the School of Social Work’s auditorium at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The event is expected to feature some of the men who are working to put their lives back together after spending time in prison for crimes they did not commit.

Baltimore has lost 107 games this year but took two of three in this series against Boston — welcome news for the Yankees, Blue Jays and Mariners. The Red Sox fell into a tie with Seattle for the American League’s second wild card. Boston trailed the Yankees by 1 1/2 games and led the Blue Jays by half a game, pending the conclusion of New York’s game at Toronto. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Kiké Hernandez homered on the first pitch of the game for the Red Sox, but not much went right for them after that. Mountcastle put Baltimore up 3-1 with his 33rd home run of the season, and the Orioles added three more runs in the sixth. Boston’s Nick Pivetta (9-8) struck out the side in the first, but he ultimately allowed three runs and four hits in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out eight with two walks. Alexander Wells (2-3) allowed a run and three hits in six innings after entering the game with a 7.61 ERA. This wasn’t as bad as 2011, when the Red Sox allowed two runs in the ninth inning at Baltimore and were eliminated on the final night of the regular season. That collapse ended manager Terry Francona’s tenure in Boston. A decade later, the Orioles were a thorn in Boston’s side again, but the Red Sox still have time to recover when they finish the regular season with a series at Washington. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Boston pitchers threw four wild pitches in this game. Two of them came in the sixth, when the Red Sox also made an error. Tyler Nevin gave the Orioles a 5-1 lead with a two-run single, and Pat Valaika followed with a sacrifice fly. TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: Boston is in an odd spot at second base. Christian Arroyo was reinstated from the COVID-19 injured list over a week ago, but José Iglesias has hit .339 in 20 games for Boston and continues to play. The Red Sox signed Iglesias in early September, so he can’t play for them in the postseason if they make it. Manager Alex Cora said Arroyo, who has played only twice since his return, is doing what he can to stay sharp. “Hopefully we have to make that decision, let’s put it that way, right? Who’s going to play second in the playoffs?” Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox: Eduardo Rodriguez (11-8) starts Friday night in the opener of the series at Washington.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The annual “Harbor Heartbeat” reported that levels of harmful bacteria are declining in the water, with 92 percent of testing sites (with enough data) showing improving or consistently high scoring bacteria scores. The report noted that testing was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lindquist said consistently improving bacteria scores was enough for the partnership to start plans for a new network of water-based trails. “We’re actually announcing today the release of a request for proposals to create a master plan for the Baltimore Blue Way, a network of water trails for paddlers in the Baltimore Harbor,” he said. The non-profit stated in its proposal that the vision for the water trail system is to follow the shoreline of the harbor and could extend from Canton Waterfront Park to the Inner Harbor and out to Masonville Cove. “I think now since the water is getting cleaner and cleaner, the idea of different activities on the water for different groups of people that are more accessible is starting to become a real possibility,” said Valerie Bloom, a former intern for Waterfront Partnership who was paddling in the harbor after the announcement about the water trails. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The report also noted that Baltimore City’s Headworks Project, which was completed last year, corrected a major flaw in its sewer system which caused tens of millions of gallons of sewage to overflow into streams and the harbor. The project included installing tanks at a city wastewater treatment plant to store water that would overflow during storms. The study stated that continued monitoring is needed to show if the project is having the desired effect on the health of Baltimore’s marine ecosystem. Another finding showed that the city’s four trash wheels have “ate” 1,608 tons of trash since the first one was installed in 2014 through 2020. Waterfront Partnership also noted in the report that while water quality in the harbor frequently tests safe for swimming, it does not recommend swimming in it at this time. “A swimming area must be monitored to protect swimmers from boat traffic, debris, toxic algal blooms, or legacy contaminants in the sediment. For these reasons, we do not recommend swimming outside of a designated swimming area. Waterfront Partnership has begun working on creating the first such swimming area in Baltimore City,” the report stated.

But the governor also criticized some Maryland school districts for not taking advantage of a state testing program and federal stimulus money to enhance safety in the classroom. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured On Tuesday, Maryland’s Board of Education  reported there have been 4,042 confirmed cases  among students in schools statewide and 681 cases among staff members. Since schools reopened, at least 16,559 students have had to quarantine, along with 784 staff members since schools reopened. “The most important thing that school systems can do right now to limit outbreaks and to prevent needless quarantines is to utilize the robust testing capacity that they’ve been given,” Hogan said during a press conference. In 2020, the state provided one million COVID-19 tests to public and non-public schools. This year, the state has earmarked $182 million for an optional program to regularly test the student population, but only 13 of the state’s 24 school systems have enrolled, Hogan said. Districts in Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Caroline, Charles, Dorchester, Frederick, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince  George’s and Worcester counties and Baltimore City, as well as 80 non-public schools, have all enrolled. The deadline to join has been extended until Oct. 10, Hogan said.

He later clarified that school districts are able to work in conjunction with the local health departments to test students if there’s sufficient capacity. “But we had some of our local leaders saying they didn’t have the ability to do testing, and we’ve had unlimited amounts of testing and money available, and we keep repeatedly telling them that,” Hogan said. “If people are not comfortable with where they are on testing, then they should get more involved and help.” Over the last 18 months, another $2.7 billion in federal stimulus money was provided to Maryland school systems to enhance classroom safety, but nearly $2 billion of that has not been spent, the governor said. “There is no excuse for any school system to fail to take any steps toward keeping their students and teachers safe,” Hogan said.

The state’s positivity rate is steady at 4 percent, with nearly 800 Marylanders hospitalized with covid, as of Thursday.

They tried to rent the city-owned MECU Pavilion at Pier Six, even putting down a deposit. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured But city leaders rejected their request. And now, the group, St. Michaels Media—also known as Church Militant—is suing and claiming their free speech rights are being violated. “Every bit of our constitution requires that the city not interfere because they don’t like speakers who might want to speak on public property,” their lawyer, Marc John Randazza, told WJZ outside court Thursday. Church Militant wants their protest to be held at the pavilion because they said the windows in the hallway outside the bishops’ conference room at the Marriott look out directly at the venue. Father Paul Kalchik of Chicago, who said a priest abused him decades ago, is among those fighting Baltimore’s decision. He testified Thursday. “It’s just like putting a muffler on the issue,” Kalchik told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren. “It is irritating to me that the city of Baltimore is stopping the victims from speaking out.” But lawyers for Baltimore City argue this is not about freedom of speech. The city fears violence in the expected crowd of three thousand people and cites incendiary speakers who are expected to attend—including Steve Bannon, the former Chief Strategist for President Trump, and  Milo Yiannopoulos , a right-wing provocateur. A  past appearance  lead to violence in Berkeley, California in 2017.  Yiannopoulos  said he does not condone such violence. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I’ve softened a bit over the years—it will sadden your viewers to discover—since I was in the headlines more,” Yiannopoulos said. “Remember what we’re doing here is not a politically charged rally for politically engaged people. What we are doing here is trying to hold a Catholic hierarchy to account.” Bannon called for the beheading of  Dr. Anthony Fauci  on his podcast last year. Church Militant held a similar protest at the bishops’ conference in Baltimore three years ago and said there was no violence then. That event attracted about one thousand people. The hearing lasted more than eight hours Thursday in Baltimore’s federal courthouse. The judge will resume arguments Friday morning at 10 a.m. “Because of the potential for significant disruption, the city has exercised its right to discontinue discussions with the Church Militant about the organization’s proposed event at the city-owned MECU Pavilion in November. The characteristics of the location and a concern about violence prompted this action,” Baltimore City’s law department said in a statement.

After  months of postponements , the city’s plastic bag ban went into effect Friday morning. The objective of the new rule is to crack down on pollution. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Specifically, single-use plastic bags under four millimeters thick that are received at the point of purchase (at the cash register) are a no-go. There are exemptions to the rule for plastic bags used to contain fresh meat and fish products, unpackaged fruits or nuts and unpackaged baked goods. For a full list of exceptions visit the website of  Baltimore’s Office of Sustainability. “Single-use plastics are not worth the convenience,” said National Aquarium President John Racanelli in 2020,  when the bill was signed . Retailers will no longer be able to give customers a plastic bag and will charge five cents for any alternative bag they provide, including paper bags. Four cents will go into the retailers’ pockets, while a penny will go to the city. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn There are no exceptions from the bag charge for FSP, WIC, or SNAP users. The legislation doesn’t mean you’ll face consequences for using the grocery bags under your sink. In fact, the city is encouraging residents to reuse bags. Your stock of grocery bags won’t be endless anymore though. The city has been  distributing reusable bags  ahead of the ban. According to Baltimore’s Office of Sustainability, the city is distributing a limited number of reusable bags to residents with accessibility challenges. Any retailer found in violation of the ban at least three times could be fined up to $1,000.   MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government                                   ", "sentiment": 0.04508950044664329, "subjectivity": 0.43327578506149933, "wordcount": 316}

(AP) —  For Justin Tucker, fitting in isn’t a problem. “You’ve never seen a kicker make so much noise in a team room,” said defensive lineman Calais Campbell, Tucker’s teammate with the Baltimore Ravens. “In the meetings, usually they try to be seen, not heard in that environment, but Tuck is so comfortable. He’s a big jokester. He’s always keeping it light, keeping it fun in there.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Tucker has good reason for that kind of confidence. If it wasn’t obvious already, his 66-yard field goal  to beat Detroit  last weekend solidified Tucker’s status as a legitimate NFL star. Kickers don’t often reach that level of prominence, but the Ravens have understood for a while just how valuable he is. “I haven’t seen any guy like this guy. He’s different,” special teams coordinator Chris Horton said. “He’s a different breed of guy. Nothing fazes him.” A lot of factors have to come together for a record-breaking kick like Tucker’s. Even if someone is capable of making a field goal from that distance, coaches aren’t eager to try it unless the clock is running down — and even then, there’s sometimes the risk of a return. Still, when Tucker  set the NFL record  with his 66-yarder, it felt like his career had been building toward this moment. Tucker has made 90.6% of his field goal attempts in his career, the best mark in NFL history, and he’s proven he has plenty of range. In 2013 at Detroit, he won a game with a 61-yard field goal. What was remarkable about that kick was that it occurred with 38 seconds remaining. The Ravens had Tucker kick from the midfield logo instead of trying to advance the ball closer. So 66 yards wasn’t that far fetched, although Tucker did miss from 65 in a 2018 game against the Chargers. On Sunday, he used a longer run-up to the ball than normal, and his kick bounced off the crossbar and through to win the game. “It’s something I’ve actually started doing within the last year,” Tucker said. “As I’m becoming more and more of a dinosaur in this league at 31 years old, I’ve got to do every little thing I can to get the ball to go just a little bit farther.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Although Tucker can joke about his age as a 10-year veteran, there’s every indication he’s still in his prime. He has made 49 consecutive fourth-quarter attempts, the NFL’s longest current streak, and while kickers aren’t usually thought of as team leaders, he’s clearly respected. And Tucker,  a music major  with a talent for opera singing, isn’t afraid to let his quirkiness show. “It’s definitely a personality that grows on you after a while,” cornerback Jimmy Smith said. “He just likes to be seen. He sings all the time. He might say the corniest joke in the world, but after a decade of being around him, those jokes are funny to me now. I think he’s hilarious.” When Tucker was young he looked up to Deion Sanders, and like Sanders, Tucker seems to relish the spotlight — a good quality for a kicker. Oddly, he says the nerves tend to show up afterward. “Whenever we’re fortunate enough to have a game-winning field goal opportunity, especially a walk-off, I get more nervous after the fact, thinking about, man, what if that didn’t go the way we wanted it to go?” he said. The Ravens haven’t had to worry about that much with Tucker, who at this rate could become that rare kicker with a legitimate Hall of Fame shot. Only two full-time kickers, Jan Stenerud and Morten Andersen, have made the Hall. Tucker won a Super Bowl in his very first season in Baltimore, and during that postseason, the Ravens beat Denver in double overtime on his 47-yard field goal. He has made memorable kicks in big moments, and he has also been quietly consistent from week to week throughout his career. In a league when it feels like just about any game can come down to the wire, having a kicker like Tucker is quite a luxury. “The more confident you are in yourself, the more ability you have to go out and do great things,” Horton said. “And when you’re around Justin, you understand that this guy is confident. He understands, and he loves the moment. He wants to be in the moment.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .05% to 4.09%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.8 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 21 to 776. Of those hospitalized, 588 remain in acute care and 209 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 533,870 total confirmed cases and 10,229 deaths. There are 3,895,792 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,928,109 doses. Of those, 3,950,385 are first doses with 2,413 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,592,515 second doses, 2,521 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 303,277 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 782 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 81,932 additional or booster vaccine doses, 3,791 in the last day. The state reported 83.7% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

He’s also expected to be charged in the  death of Rebecca Reynolds , an Allegany County woman. No motive has been released in the killings.   As WJZ works to learn more about this case, we’ve pieced together a rough timeline chronicling the killings in Allegany and Howard counties and Burnham’s subsequent arrest.   Timeline:     7:20 p.m. Sept. 29:  Rebecca Reynolds, 83, is  found dead inside a Fourth Street home in Cumberland  by authorities with the Cumberland Police Department and Allegany County Sheriff’s Office. The death of Reynolds, who had signs of “obvious trauma,” is ruled a homicide by a medical examiner. Her vehicle had also been stolen. Burnham is identified as a suspect and a warrant is issued for his arrest on murder and vehicle theft charges.   4:30 p.m. Sept. 30:  The  Allegany County Sheriff’s Office issues a statement naming Burnham as the suspect in Reynolds’ killing . Describing the 46-year-old as “armed and dangerous,” the agency says investigators believe Burnham may be driving a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette with the Maryland tag 8BX5121. Police ask the public to keep an eye out for Burnham or the Corvette, asking them to call police if he or the vehicle is seen.   5:18 p.m. Sept. 30:  Police in Howard County notify the public that  Burnham is wanted in a deadly double shooting at a home in Ellicott City , as well as an “unrelated homicide” in Allegany County. Police say they suspect all three victims were targeted, adding that the Ellicott City victims are believed to be family members of Burnham’s. The public is asked to call 911 if they see Burnham or a 2007 red Chevrolet Corvette.   10:07 p.m. Sept. 30:  Investigators announce they’ve  identified the Ellicott City shooting victims as Burnham’s brother and sister-in-law  — 58-year-old Brian Robinette and his wife, Kelly Sue. Police offer a reward of up to $10,000 for information on the whereabouts of Burnham.   9:07 a.m. Oct. 1:  Burnham and the Robinettes’ Corvette is spotted in Davis, West Virginia.  Police there take the 46-year-old into custody on charges of murder  in the deaths of the Robinettes and recover a firearm from the vehicle. Burnham is booked into jail there while awaiting an extradition hearing.                                   ", "sentiment": -0.03684210526315789, "subjectivity": 0.19736842105263164, "wordcount": 414}

The Steelers seemed lifeless in losing to a Cincinnati Bengals team that’s long been the AFC North punching bag. The Packers looked like just the opposite, coming back to knock off the San Francisco 49ers with a walk-off field goal. Pittsburgh will hope to turn things around this Sunday in the inhospitable environs of Green Bay’s Lambeau Field. It will be a tall order. “Forever Pittsburgh’s had a team and talent surrounding them where you always felt that they were championship caliber and had the opportunity to make it to a Super Bowl,” according to NFL On CBS lead reporter Tracy Wolfson. “And it just seemed to fall short every year. And this year, in particular, you’re seeing maybe, as they’re getting older, their pieces aren’t fitting together. And it’s not looking good. Then you look at the other side of it. Aaron Rogers is at the top of his game… When you have a new young coach, you have some young pieces surrounding him, and it’s a team going in a different direction.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The Steelers are beaten up on both sides of the ball, and it showed against the Bengals. They struggled to control the line of scrimmage, giving up (or giving back) big plays on offense, and failing to cause many on defense. Each of the five  offensive linemen  was penalized at least once. Najee Harris rushed for just 40 yards on 14 carries, for an average of 2.9 yards per carry. Those numbers look significantly worse when considering that half of the yardage came on one play. The makeshift offensive line held up enough in the passing game to allow Ben Roethlisberger to throw for 318 yards, though he went 38-58 with a passer rating of 70.9. And he paid the price. Big Ben was sacked four times and hit five more. Harris was his leading receiver, with 14 receptions out of the backfield, followed by Chase Claypool with nine. Juju Smith-Schuster left the game early with a rib injury, and Diontae Johnson didn’t play. Both are questionable this week. Can the Steelers offensive line slow up a Packers pass rush that lived in the 49ers backfield? The unit was missing linebacker Za’Darius Smith but still managed to sack Jimmy Garoppolo four times in Week 3 and hit him 11 more. Garoppolo went 25-40 for 257 yards and two touchdowns. The Packers shut down the 49ers running game, however, allowing just 67 yards on the team’s 21 carries. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn This Packers team still belongs to Aaron Rodgers, of course. And he showed it once again in Week 3, using two long passes to Davante Adams in the final minute to give kicker Mason Crosby a chance to kick for the win. Crosby converted his 54-yard attempt. “You have to be able to close those games out and have the confidence to do it,” Wolfson stressed. “Aaron Rodgers has it. LaFleur has it. Davante Adams has it. And with this team, it’s so obvious if you give him 37 seconds, he’s going to be able to march down there, and allow them to kick the field goal.” On the game, Rodgers completed 23 passes for 253 yards, two TDs and a passer rating of 113.3. He found Adams a total of 12 times for 132 yards. Aaron Jones averaged an effective 4.3 yards per carry on his 19 carries. If the Steelers have any shot at staying with the Packers this Sunday, their defense will have to step up. The vaunted Pittsburgh pass rush failed to sack or hit Joe Burrow even once last week. And the Bengals offensive line is among the worst in the league. The return of Watt and Highsmith would help the Steelers generate more pressure, though both were limited in practice as of Wednesday. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “They’re going to have to find a way [to pressure Aaron Rodgers], because Aaron Rodgers likes to get the ball out. He can move. He’s going to find Davante Adams down the field,” said Wolfson. “I think the key for them is really focusing on — and I’m gonna use a term that Brandon Staley used in the Chargers game — put a roof on it. Let’s just blanket everyone, and let’s take away that long deep passing game and not allow explosive plays… Take away the deep pass. You’re not going to necessarily get that pressure.

(WCCO) —  Hunting season is upon us, but for some people getting to a duck blind or a deer stand isn’t that easy. Thanks to some kind-hearted individuals, one hunter who struggles a bit more than others can now enjoy his favorite hobby without as much frustration. “I just like the fresh air and being out with friends and family,” says Lance Tebben of Montevideo. It doesn’t matter what kind of hunting it is, Lance is all in. Born with cerebral palsy, he quickly developed a love for the outdoors. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “I’ve gotten a deer every year I’ve been out, and last year I got a 14-point buck,” he says. But if there’s one thing holding Lance back, it’s that his wheelchair wasn’t really made for hunting. Guides push him across all kinds of rough terrain. “Just trying to pull Lance in this chair here, it was just really hard. That’s why we said, hey, let’s try and do something for the kid,” says Chuck Ellingson, of Watson Hunting Camp. So they did. A fundraiser to raise money for an all-terrain powered wheelchair took off faster than anyone could have imagined. In a short amount of time, people from across the area donated more than $13,000. And on Thursday morning, Lance finally got his new ride. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Awesome, he had a smile from ear to ear,” says Lowell Tebben, Lance’s dad. “I’m thankful to all the people that donated and businesses and everything. Thanks for making this happen for him,” adds Pam Tebben, Lance’s mom. “Here we are today delivering a chair to Lance, all based off a dream,” declares Nathan Rud of Action Manufacturing, the company that made the chair. “This is 100% off-road. There isn’t much that’s going to stop it.” Lance’s new chair runs almost like a snowmobile. On Saturday, he’ll take it on its first hunting trip when he takes part in a deer hunt for people with disabilities. Now, it’ll be the guides’ turn to try and keep up with him. “I was so happy when I heard they were getting one of these for me. It’s pretty awesome,” says Lance. “It makes me feel like I’m very important. I couldn’t stop smiling and I still can’t stop smiling.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Lance wanted to thank everyone who donated, including hunting guide Stanton Kelley who got the idea for the fundraiser.

Blue Bloods is back for season 12 tonight at 10:00PM on CBS and Paramount+. Last time we saw you there was the big wedding so now that your characters are wed how is that going to change the dynamic of the show moving forward? WE-  I was concerned about it to be honest, I thought we had something really good going on with the whole will they/won’t they. I was nervous about losing what these two characters have together but it seems to me like against the odds, it’s working. We’re playing a couple that’s now getting into life after getting married. They’re still working together, though they’re not partners anymore. VR- They’re a couple that’s finding their way to navigate through all of these different obstacles. There’s a power dynamic, gender, quality of work, how do we navigate the next steps of being married. we’ve gone through that big explosion of love and now you’re dealing with the day to day acts of kindness and acts of service towards each other. You’re still trying to find your voice within your first year of marriage and finding your identity as a couple and as individuals. So this season we come up against a lot of those issues on the show. We want to show what real married couples go through. It’s a lot to work through it and it’s hard to always find that through line of love and respect for one another. There’s a lot of juicy stuff going on between Jaime and Eddie this season. WE-  Our love language is when your partner knows their lines. [Laughs] MW-  You mentioned gender equality and the show touches on a lot of very timely topics this season. How do topics like that alter the way you prepare to take on these roles? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn VR-  Yeah I think it’s tremendously affected the way that we approach our characters. You know there’s no denying that there’s a lot of scrutiny on police officers right now and the toll that that can take. For all of our characters it becomes kind of a question of why you got into it at all to begin with. We really take a hard look at what good they’re doing, why they got into police work in the first place, if they’re serving their community in a way that they hoped that they would. This is sort of like the second half of Cinderella. You go to the ball you think you’re gonna fall in love, you’re gonna go change the world, you’re gonna make the world a better place. Then after going to the ball, you’re like oh so this is the ball, this is a pretty intense place to navigate. WE-  It’s just a tremendous responsibility. We’re playing characters on our show that are hopefully three dimensional or flawed, but are good guys. So we’re telling it from that perspective. We’re also people though and we have personal experiences and I think it’s just a tremendous amount of responsibility to tackle these types of issues. The societal consciousness is so polarized right now on so many issues, and it’s challenging to folks. But it’s sort of what we signed up and it’s just a lot of responsibility to get it right. As human beings we want to do a show from a perspective of these characters that are police officers and do it the right way. MW-  And  Blue Bloods  is over 200 episodes in now so clearly doing something right! Thank you both for the time and congrats on tonight’s premiere! WE-  You too, take care. VR-  Thanks Matt!

(WJZ) —  Baltimore County Police were able to identify the body of a woman found in Woodlawn back in the 1970s. There were few details about the woman who became known as “Woodlawn Jane Doe.” in 1975, a young woman went missing from her home in Virginia. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Her body was eventually found near a cemetery in Woodlawn and no one could identify her until now. “It was finally genetic genealogy that was able to give her her name back,” said Teresa Vreeland. Genetic genealogists at Bode Technology worked with Baltimore County Police and together were able to identify the missing teen as Margaret Fetterolf. “So we were able to use DNA from her remains that were recovered and did some searches within the genealogy databases to build out family trees and ultimately identify her,” Vreeland explained. Teresa Vreeland is the Director of Forensic Genealogy. She says within the database, they were able to find Margaret’s distant relatives and turned the information over to the police.

Donna Carter is with the homicide and missing persons unit and says this is the oldest unidentified murder victim in the county. “We have great investigators who just don’t let these cases go. So they’re always being worked,” said Carter. And now knowing her name Carter says they can try to put together a timeline from the day Margaret went missing. Police are hoping that with this new piece of information, they’ll be able to finally solve this case they want to hear from former classmates, friends, or anyone who may recognize Margaret from her photo to give them a call.

Below is a breakdown of some of the law changes: Environmental Laws READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured On the environmental front, it is now illegal for Maryland residents ages 13 and older and organizations to intentionally release balloons into the sky, even if the deed is aimed at honoring someone. Besides that,  Baltimore’s ban on single-use plastic bags is now in effect . As part of that measure, businesses located within the city are now required to charge at least five cents for alternative bags such as totes and paper bags, a penny of which goes to the city. Mayor Brandon Scott said the ban is not just about making the city cleaner for current residents but for future generations as well. “I know this is a huge cultural shift for Baltimore, but I want our residents to know it can be done,” Scott said. “Our sister city in D.C. did it some many moons ago and the Anacostia River is a lot cleaner for it.” Police Reforms Several police reform laws also became effective Friday, including Anton’s Law. The law — named after Anton Black, a 19-year-old man from the Eastern Shore who died in police custody in 2018 — makes it so that records of police misconduct are now open to the public. The measure also imposes limits on so-called no-knock warrants, which have come under local and national scrutiny in the wake of high-profile deaths of people at the hands of police. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “With the public disclosure of these police records, agencies will be less inclined to ignore public complaints, to downgrade them and fail to render discipline when warranted,” Maryland Senator Jill Carter said of the law. Another police reform is the formation of a new independent team of investigators with the Maryland Attorney General’s Office who will take over deadly incidents involving law enforcement. In addition to those measures, the Justice Restoration Act will now keep juveniles convicted of serious crimes from being sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Election Laws Other laws taking effect Friday include measures that will influence voting and elections. For instance, the state is extending windows for early voting. Prior to Friday, early voting facilities had to open at 10 a.m. for most elections and 8 a.m. for presidential elections. Now, however, all early voting centers must be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Aside from that, a separate law now means that many counties will be tasked with establishing additional early voting locations. Progress For LGBTQ Among the many measures that became law Friday was House Bill 130, which establishes the Commission on LGBTQ Affairs in the Governor’s Office. This panel is tasked with: evaluating challenges the LGBTQ community faces; collecting data on LGBTQ-inclusive policies and complaints involving alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; and studying and creating best practices for inclusion of LGBTQ individuals and communities; among other things.

With all four divisional rivals squaring off in week 4, something’s got to give as two unbeatens look to stay perfect and the West’s two other squads attempt to erase the sting of last week’s collapses. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts SportsLine ‘s  Larry Hartstein  breaks down NFC East matchups in Week 4. All times listed are Eastern. Seattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers, Sunday, October 3, 4:05 p.m. The Seahawks and 49ers will clash for the 46th time this weekend. So far Seattle has gotten the better of the Niners more often than not with 28 wins in the series. This year’s Seahawks squad feels a bit different than years past though. Currently sitting a game under .500 the Hawks are coming off back-to-back losses where they squandered early leads with terrible second-half execution. It also doesn’t help that the Seahawks’ defense is currently last in the league when it comes to yards allowed per game. “They blew that game against Tennessee,” Hartstein said. “They had the big lead and then last week again in Minnesota, they come out on fire, score 17 quick points, do not score a point in the second half. I don’t think it’s so much of the offense being the problem, it’s the defense. They’ve given up the most yards in all of football, 440 per game. That is not allowing the offense to get on the field enough. Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers also tasted defeat last week, but put up a great fight against the Green Bay Packers. Had any quarterback besides Aaron Rodgers been under center in that match-up San Francisco would likely be 3-0 right now. “You look at this 49ers team that played very well offensively against Green Bay,” Hartstein said. “But they suffered more injuries in the secondary. Aaron Rodgers picked them apart.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University San Francisco hasn’t been particularly stellar on either side of the ball this year, but they’re solid across the board. It is worth noting that their two high-scoring games early on this season have been against the Lions and Packers, the worst and fifth-worst scoring defenses in the NFC. As for a final prediction, Hartstein sees the Seahawks having a leg, or wing, up. “It’s hard to see Russell Wilson losing three straight games,” Hartstein said. “I think Russell Wilson is going to have plenty of success. This is going to be a shootout, because I don’t think either team can stop the other.” Arizona Cardinals @ Los Angeles Rams, Sunday, October 3, 4:05 p.m. The Cardinals and Rams account for six of the division’s nine wins through three weeks, each coming in at a perfect 3-0. Both teams embody the modern NFL with their high-powered offenses. Matthew Stafford comes into week 4 with nine passing touchdowns, second only to the age-less Tom Brady. Arizona’s signal caller, Kyler Murray, has seven scores through the air and another three on the ground. As a team, the Cardinals are tied for first in points scored with 103 and the Rams are just a few tallies behind, ranked third in the league with 95. It’s been smooth sailing for the most part for both of these teams although they both had near falls in week 2. The Rams took a tight one in Indianapolis 27-24 and the Cardinals squeaked past the Vikings 34-33. Each team rebounded nicely with a double digit victory last week as Los Angeles took down “Age-less Tom” and the defending Super Bowl Champion Buccaneers and the Cards tamed the Jaguars. With the battle of NFC West unbeatens going down this Sunday in LA, Hartstein is leaning towards the boys in blue and yellow. “They’re both 3-0. When you look at Arizona, they probably should have lost to the Vikings,” Hartstein said. “They missed a chip-shot field goal, Minnesota does, that would have beaten Arizona. Then Arizona goes to Jacksonville, was down 19-10 with that crazy kick return before halftime but then they get a Trevor Lawrence picks-six to turn it around and cover. You got to actually respect that, because that was a sleepy spot for Arizona with this game on deck and yet they still covered the number. But all of that said, I’m more impressed with the Rams and Matthew Stafford in this offense, which is exactly what Sean McVay has been dreaming about. And then you look at the matchup. He has owned the Cardinals, Sean McVay is 8-0. He’s put up 30 points in almost all of those with the average margin of victory around 20.” MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts Which picks can you make with confidence this week, and which Super Bowl contender goes down hard?

From Oct. 5 and 6, when the American League and National League wild-card games, respectively, are scheduled to be played, to potentially Nov. 3, when the champagne would flow following a championship-deciding, World Series Game 7, the  2021 MLB playoffs  promise to pack as many as 43 high-stakes games into four weeks.    If you’re a cable or satellite subscriber with a decently diverse channel lineup, you should be good to go. But if you’re a cord-cutting free agent, then you need a plan for streaming and watching all the MLB postseason action.    Should you go with  YouTube TV ? Would  Hulu Plus Live TV  work?  Sling TV ? Something else? You can find answers here. We’re running through five of the leading live-TV streaming services, and assessing how each will meet your playoff-baseball needs. We also take a look at  MLB.TV , and give some love to free-TV fans with a  digital-antenna recommendation .    If all this sounds like a lot to take in, it is. MLB doesn’t make it easy on armchair fans who want to follow every pitch facing  Mookie Betts  and the  2020 World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers ,  Jose Altuve ’s  Houston Astros ,  Christian Yelich ’s  Milwaukee Brewers  and more.   After the wild-card games, there are three rounds of playoff action: Each league has two division series, followed by one league championship series each; and, then, of course, the singular World Series. (This math, by the by, does  not  account for any potential regular-season tie-breaker games.)     From there, the  2021 MLB playoff schedule  is split among a total of  five  networks — ESPN, FS1, the MLB Network, TBS and Fox. You’ll need: ESPN to watch the AL Wild Card Game; TBS for the NL Wild Card Game, plus all the NL Division Series games and the NL Championship Series; FS1 and the MLB Network for the AL Division Series games; FS1 and Fox for the AL Championship Series; and, finally, Fox for the World Series.    But where to stream and how? It’s time to step up to the plate, and find out.   SUBSCRIBE TO YOUTUBE TV       YouTube TV   Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images (photo illustration)   YouTube TV  is the MVP of this rundown.  It’s the only live-TV streaming service discussed here with a basic package that’ll ( maybe ) get you every MLB postseason inning.   Note, basic doesn’t mean cheap:  YouTube TV’s standard monthly service  costs $65. For that investment, you get more than 85 live-TV channels, including ESPN, FS1, TBS, the MLB Network, and, depending on your coverage area, your local, over-the-air TV stations, including Fox. (Conversely, if you and your zip code aren’t so lucky, then you  won’t  get Fox with YouTubeTV.)   As with the other live-TV services noted here, there are no installation fees, equipment fees or contracts. And, as with the competition,  YouTube TV  is supported on a number of devices and streaming media players. One heads-up for Roku users:  YouTube TV  is currently  not  available in the Roku channel store. Until YouTube TV’s parent company (aka Google) and Roku resolve their  months-long contract dispute , new users who haven’t previously downloaded the app will have to settle for watching YouTube TV in work-around fashion via the YouTube channel.   As of publication,  YouTube TV  was offering new users a  free trial , followed by a $10 discount off a monthly subscription (for the first three months).   Watch the 2021 MLB playoffs on YouTube TV (subscription required)     DirecTV Stream   DirecTV (screenshot)   The recently launched, rebranded live-TV streaming service (formerly known as AT&T TV) follows the no-contract, no-hassle, loads-of-channels script of YouTube TV. And cable vets will be familiar with its tiered packages and pricing.   As far as 2021 MLB playoff action goes, if you’re a completist, then you’ll need  DirecTV Stream ‘s $85-a-month  “Choice” package . It features more than 90 live-TV channels, including ESPN, FS1, MLB Network, TBS and, depending on your coverage area, your local Fox station.   If you don’t care as much about American League teams, such as the Houston Astros, then you can get by with  DirecTV Stream ‘s $70-a-month “Entertainment” tier. It offers more than 65 channels, including all the playoff-baseball channels you’ll need —  except  MLB Network. (So, to be clear, this option means you’d miss some AL Division Series action.)   Watch the 2021 MLB playoffs on DirecTV Stream (subscription required)       Hulu Plus Live TV   Hulu via Facebook   In a way,  Hulu Plus Live TV  is a streaming service for  extremely  old-school baseball fans — the folks who consider the American League an inferior upstart to the National League. Translation: A  monthly Hulu Plus Live TV subscription  (regularly priced at $65) will get you more than 75 channels, including ESPN, FS1, TBS and potentially your local Fox station, but  not  the AL Division Series-airing MLB Network.   Hulu Plus Live TV  does have something its competitors don’t: Access to standard, ad-supported Hulu, including  new Hulu original shows  such as “Only Murders in the Building” and “Dopesick.”   As of publication,  Hulu Plus Live TV  was offering new subscribers a seven-day free trial, followed by $10 off the first three months of a monthly subscription.   Watch the 2021 MLB playoffs on Hulu Plus Live TV (subscription required)     FuboTV   Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images (photo illustration)   For $65 a month,  FuboTV’s “Starter” tier  offers as many as 110 channels, including ESPN, FS1 and, once again, depending on your area, your local Fox station. An $8-a-month add-on package, known as “Fubo Extra,” will get you MLB Network, too. If you go for the  “Elite” tier , you’ll get 158 channels,  plus  the “Fubo Extra” channels, bundled together for $80 a month.   Note we’ve haven’t said anything about TBS: FuboTV doesn’t have it. So, if you’re a diehard fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants and other National League teams, then  FuboTV  may just not be the ticket. (Remember: TBS is the  only  channel for NL playoff action before the World Series.)   As of publication,  FuboTV  was offering new users a free trial.   Watch the 2021 MLB playoffs on FuboTV (subscription required)     Sling TV   Sling TV via Facebook   Among the services covered here,  Sling TV  has the cheapest live-TV prices: $35 a month for its so-called “Orange” and “Blue” tiers. But here’s the thing: To get  every  2021 MLB playoff game, you’ll need the  $50-a-month, “Orange & Blue” service ,  plus  the $15-a-month  MLB Network-delivering “Sports Extras” package . So, yup, $65 a month, just like the competitors.   If you don’t mind skipping the NL Wild Card game, then you can get by with the ESPN-free “Blue” tier. That’ll bring you FS1, TBS and  potentially your local Fox station . Complete the subscription with the “Sports Extra” add-on, priced at this level for $11 a month. All together, you’ll have everything you need ( but  the NL Wild Card game) for $46 a month.   As of publication, Sling TV was offering the “Orange” and “Blue” tiers to new users for just $10 each for the first month; the deal for the “Orange & Blue” tier was $20 for the first month.   Watch the 2021 MLB playoffs on Sling TV (subscription required)       Indoor HD digital TV antenna   U Must Have via Amazon   If you’re still with us, and haven’t given up figuring out which streaming option will give you the most bang for your playoff-baseball buck, then we offer you the  U Must Have amplified, indoor HD digital TV antenna .   For a flat $30, it’ll deliver any live, Fox-aired games, including the World Series, to your HDTV set — plus everything else offered by the other free, digital channels in your area.  No subscription, no monthly fee. Just connect the U Must Have to your set, and watch. It’s the 20th century TV-viewing experience with 21st century technology.   The U Must Have antenna  boasts nearly 14,000 customer reviews on Amazon  — and a  four-and-a-half star rating .   Not to complicate things, but keep in mind that the reason cable TV became a thing is that some neighborhoods just don’t get very good TV reception. Today’s digital antennae are far better than the  rabbit ears of yore , but even they can only do so much if your home is reception-challenged.   And one more thing: As noted above, the live-TV streamers can’t guarantee that you’ll get all your local TV stations. So, if you live in an area where your, say, YouTube TV subscription will  not  include Fox, then you’re going to need a digital antenna to pick up the free-TV channel.   U Must Have indoor HD digital TV antenna, $30     MLB.TV   Hunter Martin/Getty Images   Our very last option is the simplest: With a  MLB.TV subscription , you can watch every single MLB playoff game — no ifs, ands or buts. There’s just one very big caveat: If you’re a true cord-cutter (meaning, you  don’t  have a TV provider), then you  can’t  watch the games live. (Local-TV blackouts will apply to MLB.TV users who  do  have TV providers, so, truly, nothing is perfect.)   For all subscribers, postseason games will be available to stream on MLB.TV 90 minutes   after they conclude. Archived action is still a lot of action — and it’s all in one place.   As of publication, a new, yearly  MLB.TV subscription  could be had for $26.99. (The subscription will expire before the start of 2022’s MLB spring training.) A seven-day free trial was also available.

Those teams were tied for the second wild card spot, two games behind the Yankees. Jansen hit a two-run homer off Thomas Eshelman (0-3) in the third inning, his 10th, and Corey Dickerson added a solo shot off Brooks Kriske in Toronto’s four-run sixth. The Blue Jays lead the majors with 253 homers this season, four shy of the club record set in 2010. Dickerson’s blast was the first of five straight two-out hits by the Blue Jays. Santiago Espinal and Jansen hit back-to-back doubles, and Cavan Biggio singled and took second on a throw.

The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .01% to 4.08%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations decreased by 24 to 752. Of those hospitalized, 548 remain in acute care and 204 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 535,157 total confirmed cases and 10,243 deaths. There are 3,903,142 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,954,222 doses. Of those, 3,957,284 are first doses with 6,899 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,599,123 second doses, 6,608 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 304,019 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 742 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 92,796 additional or booster vaccine doses, 11,864 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 83.8% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

He used his quick feet to crown Baltimore’s 23-7 thumping of the Denver Broncos and tie an NFL rushing record. The Ravens (3-1) were in danger of coming up just short of matching the Steelers’ longstanding mark for consecutive games with at least 100 yards rushing before Baltimore cornerback Anthony Averett intercepted Broncos backup QB Drew Lock in the end zone with 3 seconds left. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Rather than take a knee, Jackson took the shotgun snap and hustled around the left end for 5 yards as time expired. That gave the Ravens 102 yards on the ground, their 43rd consecutive 100-yard rushing game, tying the mark set by Pittsburgh from 1974-77. “Oh yeah, 100% my call,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said unapologetically. “That’s one of those things that’s meaningful. As a head coach you have to be mindful of your team and your players and what it means to them. It’s a very, very tough record to accomplish and it’s a long-term record. “I’m not going to say it’s more important than winning the game, for sure, it’s certainly not,” Harbaugh added. “But as a head coach you do that for your players and you do that for your coaches and it’s something they’ll have for the rest of their lives.” Harbaugh’s players appreciated their coach letting them go for the record. “Whenever you’re in the record books it’s important, so it’s great to get it,” said receiver Marquise Brown, who caught Jackson’s 49-yard TD pass one week after dropping a trio of long passes. “I wasn’t thinking about the record,” Jackson said. “I was thinking about getting the win.” Jackson missed two practices last week with a sore back, but it didn’t look as if it affected him at all Sunday. “I’m feeling good,” he said. “Did I look good?” Although he was held to 28 yards rushing, Jackson threw for 316 yards. “We wanted to limit his opportunities to carry it and scramble,” Broncos coach Vic Fangio said. “We did that. But they were able to complete the long passes, which negated that.” Only twice in his four-year NFL career has Jackson passed for more yards, once in the regular season (324) and once in the playoffs (365). “I can’t believe people say he couldn’t throw. It’s wild, barbaric,” suggested Ravens receiver James Proche II. “That’s like saying water is dry. He’s just doing his job, nothing crazy, just doing what he do.” Justin Tucker, who beat the Lions last week with an NFL-record long 66-yard field goal, was perfect from 40, 46 and 20 yards in Denver’s thin air. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The Broncos (3-1) punted on 10 of their 12 possessions after punting just nine times total in their three wins. They lost starting QB Teddy Bridgewater to a concussion on his final pass of the first half. Ravens rookie linebacker Odafe Oweh hit Bridgewater under the chin but wasn’t flagged. Neither was cornerback Tavon Young whistled one play earlier for hitting a defenseless receiver when his brutal hit sent WR/KR Diontae Spencer from the game with an injury to his sternum. The injuries occurred during a series of curious calls by Broncos offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, who had Bridgewater throw three times after Denver got the ball at its 17 with 1:02 left in the first half and Denver down 14-7. All three throws fell incomplete–Bridgewater completed just 7 of 16 passes after posting 75% days in each of Denver’s three wins–and the Broncos punted the ball back to Baltimore with Tucker warming up on the sideline. Devin Duvernay’s 42-yard return set up Tucker for an easy 40-yarder as the first half expired, giving the Ravens a 17-7 halftime lead. One play after bouncing a short pass to Sammy Watkins, Jackson wound up and hit Brown with the 49-yard touchdown pass that put Baltimore ahead for good 14-7 in the second quarter. Noah Fant caught a 3-yard TD pass from Bridgewater to put Denver on the board and the Ravens responded with a long drive capped by Latavius Murray’s 11-yard touchdown romp that tied it at 7. SACK MASTERS The Ravens had five sacks and linebacker Tyus Bowser sacked both Bridgewater and Lock. INJURIES Ravens offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva hobbled off in the third quarter with a knee injury. His replacement, Andre Smith, was flagged for a face mask away from the play that negated TE Mark Andrews’ 30-yard TD reception.

Pharmaceutical company Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said they’ve developed a drug that reduces the risk of hospitalization or death for patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured If cleared by federal regulators, it would be the first pill to treat COVID-19. Doctors said this COVID-19 pill will hopefully allow them to treat many more COVID patients at home faster, and ease the load on hospitals. But they also want to remind people this new breakthrough should not minimize the push to get vaccinated. “This is exciting and can be a really important part of our toolbox,” Dr. Namandje N. Bumpus, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said. Pharmaceutical company Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics recently announced promising results with its experimental COVID-19 anti-viral drug, Molnupiravir. “It essentially works by preventing replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” Bumpus said. The drug company looked at 775 adults with mild to moderate COVID-19, at high risk for severe disease. The patients who received the antiviral pill took it within five days of symptoms. “They needed to stop the study and go forward and present the data, because it was so positive and so clear-cut, it seems,” Bumpus said. Their study shows the pill has cut the risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 in at-risk patients by 50%. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I think when we’re seeing these things come out, there’s a little bit of thinking now,  Well I don’t need to get vaccinated now, if there’s a treatment ,” Bumpus said. Still, doctors continue to stress vaccines remain the number one tool in the fight against COVID-19. “We’re trying to prevent getting COVID in the first place,” Bumpus said. This comes as Maryland reported over 1,000 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths Sunday. The statewide positivity rate is slightly up, at 4.1 percent. “There’s people getting their first dose today,” said Dr. Kathleen Page, infectious disease physician and faculty at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “So that’s fantastic.” In Baltimore, COVID-19 ambassadors with the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine have been hard at work targeting the Latino community. “I think it’s important to be where the community is, to meet people where they are,” Page said. So far, over 107,000 Marylanders have received booster shots, and there’s been a sharp rise in the daily first and second doses administered over the past two days. Merck officials said the company plans to seek emergency authorization from the FDA as soon as possible for its COVID-19 treatment pill.

Toronto needed to win, and a loss by the Yankees or Red Sox on the final day of the regular season to force at least a tiebreaker game Monday for an AL wild-card spot. But the Blue Jays’ hopes were dashed when Boston rallied from a four-run deficit to beat Washington 7-5 on a two-run homer by Rafael Devers in the top of the ninth inning that silenced stunned Toronto fans at Rogers Centre who stuck around to watch on the big video board. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured A little earlier, New York edged Tampa Bay 1-0 with a run in the bottom of the ninth to clinch a postseason berth. “Unfortunately our fate was in the hands of another team,” Springer said. “We were hoping for something but obviously it didn’t happen.” With the loss, the Orioles finished the 2021 season with an American League-worst record of 52-110. “Obviously, our record isn’t where it needs to be,” Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini said. “We’ve got a long way to go, but a lot of really good things happened this year and a lot of guys made names for themselves.” After the Arizona Diamondbacks hit a walk-off home run in the 9th inning against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, the Orioles potentially secured the No. 1 overall pick in the 2022 MLB Draft. The league’s current collective bargaining agreement, which sets the working relationship between players and teams, including how the draft order is determined, is scheduled to expire in December. Under the  current rules , the order of the draft is determined by the previous year’s standings. The Orioles and Diamondbacks had identical 52-110 records in 2021 and 25-35 records in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. In 2019, the Orioles won 54 games and the Diamondbacks won 85.

The Blue Jays (91-71) hit four home runs in Game 162 to finish with 262, the highest total in the majors this season and the most in Toronto history. Springer gave the Blue Jays an early advantage with a leadoff homer against right-hander Bruce Zimmermann in the first. It was the 43rd leadoff home run of his career and fourth this season. Springer made it 9-1 with his grand slam off Eric Hanhold in the third, the sixth slam of his career. Guerrero drove in Springer when he homered off Marcos Diplán in the second, matching Kansas City’s Saldavor Perez for the major league lead. Guerrero also broke a tie with Eddie Matthews (1953) for the most home runs in one season by a player 22 or younger. Making his second start after a stint on the injured list because of a sore neck, Ryu allowed six hits and two runs. He walked one and struck out seven. Nate Pearson, Julian Merryweather, Jacob Barnes and Adam Cimber all worked one inning for Toronto. Zimmermann (4-5) faced seven batters before being replaced. He allowed five hits and three runs. “I didn’t want to pull him early but three runs given up, traffic on the bases, I was trying to keep it right there,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said.

The percentage of people testing positive increased slightly by .02% to 4.1%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 10 to 762. Of those hospitalized, 566 remain in acute care and 196 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 535,157 total confirmed cases and 10,243 deaths. There are 3,910,022 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,981,465 doses. Of those, 3,964,287 are first doses with 7,003 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,605,753 second doses, 6,630 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 304,269 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 250 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 107,156 additional or booster vaccine doses, 13,360 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 83.9% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22.

The US is averaging around 107,000 new infections every day, according to Johns Hopkins University — down from more than 150,000 just last month. Rates of hospitalizations and deaths have also been on the decline. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured But Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC’s “This Week” that over nearly 20 months of the pandemic, Covid surges have subsided only to come back again. “The way to keep it down, to make that turnaround continue to go down, is to … get people vaccinated. When you have 70 million people in the country who are eligible to be vaccinated who are not yet vaccinated, that’s the danger zone right there,” Fauci said. With winter fast approaching, experts have warned of the  double threat  Covid-19 and the flu could have on an already strained health care system. But Fauci told CBS’s “Face the Nation” it is too early to tell whether the holiday season will be a safe time for Americans to gather. “We’ve just got to concentrate on continuing to get those numbers down, and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we’re going to do at a particular time,” he said. “Let’s focus like a laser on continuing to get those cases down, and we can do it by people getting vaccinated.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its  guidance on holiday celebrations , urging people to get vaccinated before the holidays and wear a mask indoors in public in areas of substantial transmission. “Attending gatherings to celebrate events and holidays increases your risk of getting and spreading Covid-19. The safest way to celebrate is virtually, with people who live with you, or outside and at least 6 feet apart from others,” it said. The CDC guidance also recommends people delay travel until they are fully vaccinated. Nearly 56% of the total US population, or 65.4% of those ages 12 and up who are eligible, are fully vaccinated, according to data  published Sunday by the CDC. However, 15 states have yet to fully vaccinate more than half of their residents, according to CDC data: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming. Mandates spur vaccination and opposition Mandates requiring employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19  have spurred some workers to get vaccinated in recent weeks, but others who have declined vaccination are being suspended or losing their jobs. In New York City, a vaccine mandate for educators went into effect Friday afternoon, and New York City Schools Chancellor Meisha Porter told CNN she did not expect the mandate to result in a teacher shortage Monday, noting 93% of the city’s teachers are vaccinated. “We have more subs that are vaccinated than unvaccinated, teachers and our superintendents have been working with our principals to develop plans to ensure our students get the education and continue to get the education they deserve in person,” Porter said. Porter pushed back on claims from some teachers who say they are being unfairly forced to vaccinate instead of being given a chance to test out. “We are responsible for over a million students and we have elementary school students who are not eligible for vaccination and so we have to do everything in our power to wrap a bubble of protection around our children and keep them safe,” Porter said. On CBS Sunday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, warned against the politicization of vaccines in the US. Gottlieb said vaccination has always been viewed as a collective decision rather than just individual choice. “That’s why we have a childhood immunization schedule, because your behavior — with respect to your choice around vaccination — affects your community,” he said. Gottlieb said there could be consequences of vaccination becoming a political issue. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I worry that, going forward, we’re going to see vaccination rates decline as this becomes more of a political football, and we see people — literally, governors running against vaccines and vaccine mandates — in the next presidential cycle. That’s going to the be deleterious to the public health, generally, if that’s what comes out of this episode we’re in,” he said. Promising pill shouldn’t deter vaccination The US  surpassed 700,000 deaths  from Covid-19 Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University and the country is still averaging nearly 1,900 deaths a day. President Joe Biden marked the grim toll in a statement Saturday, and noted the impact of vaccination, saying, “Hundreds of thousands of families have been spared the unbearable loss that too many Americans have already endured during this pandemic.” As the country reflected on the death toll, Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics  announced  they had created an antiviral pill that can reduce Covid-19 hospitalization and death by 50%, according to their data. Merck said it would seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its molnupiravir medication “as soon as possible.” If permitted, it would become the first oral medicine that fights Covid-19. The news was hailed by health experts who also cautioned it shouldn’t be a replacement for vaccinations. “It is never OK to get infected,” Fauci told CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday. “It decreased the risk — this pill did — of hospitalizations and death by 50%. You know the way to decrease the risk by 100%? Don’t get infected in the first place,” he said. As for those relying on previous infection to protect them from getting Covid-19 again, a new study published Friday in the journal The Lancet Microbe, suggests that protection may be short-lived. “Reinfection can reasonably happen in three months or less,” Jeffrey Townsend, a professor of biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health and the study’s lead author, said in a news release. “Therefore, those who have been naturally infected should get vaccinated. Previous infection alone can offer very little long-term protection against subsequent infections.” Vaccines for children on the horizon Parents hoping to vaccinate their children received some good news last week, with Pfizer announcing Tuesday it had submitted Covid-19 vaccine data on children ages 5 to 11 to the FDA for initial review. The company has not yet sought emergency use authorization, but on Friday, the FDA announced its vaccine advisers would meet on October 26 to discuss the data. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is currently approved for people age 16 and older in the US, and has emergency use authorization for people ages 12 to 15. On Sunday, Fauci warned while a child might have less chance of having a severe outcome from a case of Covid-19, it is not a “benign situation.” “We are seeing now, very clearly, if you go to pediatric hospitals, that although this risk is less than the adult, there are children in hospital who are getting seriously ill,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” There is also the risk of long Covid, where some survivors, including children, suffer lingering symptoms for months after getting infected, he said. “You want to protect your child, but you also want to make the child a part of the solution, mainly so that there’s not spread of infection, either within your household or to other vulnerable people,” Fauci said, adding it is a “very positive, good thing to get their children vaccinated.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .02% to 4.08%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by one to 763. Of those hospitalized, 564 remain in acute care and 199 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 537,327 total confirmed cases and 10,260 deaths. There are 3,910,022 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 7,981,466 doses. Of those, 3,964,287 are first doses with 7,003 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,605,753 second doses, 6,630 in the last day. The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 304,269 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 250 in the last day.

Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 107,156 additional or booster vaccine doses, 13,360 in the last day. The state reported 84% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

One of the highlights of our lives.”   Jary says he’s going to do his part as much as he can to reach out to fellow veterans.

Oregon’s new Polar Passage habitat has several different areas and will be able to provide her with her own space as needed and opportunities for continued socialization.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The more confident Neva is moving to an unspecified zoo, where she will eventually be paired with a male bear to mate with. “Neva has experience being around a male since she had a brother to compete with who was almost twice her size, and she is more assertive in her behavior,” continued McClure.  “Neva tends to solicit interaction from Amelia and we felt she would be more comfortable engaging with a male which would likely lead to more successful breeding.” The zoo said the bear’s schedule at the Polar Bear Watch will be sporadic as they prepare for the big move. The exhibit will now be solely for grizzly bear cubs Nova and Nita, orphans expected to remain at the Maryland Zoo for life.

(WJZ) —  Howard County is seeking a $75 million federal loan to pay for major infrastructure projects intended to head off flooding. The county announced Monday it has filed an application to borrow that money from the Environmental Protection Agency to fund an extension of the North Tunnel and other infrastructure projects identified as priorities by the Ellicott City Safe & Sound plan. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Our commitment to keeping Ellicott City Safe & Sound has not wavered, and this critical funding for the now Extended North Tunnel and our other projects paves the way for us to be a national example for implementing flood mitigation efforts for a historic town,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said. The funding would be lent out through the EPA’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or WIFIA, program, which offers more favorable borrowing terms than issuing a 20-year bond. In recent years, Howard County has assembled more than $56 million in funds to carry out the Safe & Sound plan, including over $20 million from the state and nearly $30 million more from the county. The push to shield Ellicott City from natural disaster comes after flooding devastated the town twice in three years, first in July 2016 and again in May 2018. Both floods were deadly and left behind significant damage to the town’s historic Main Street corridor. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn A plan to extend the North Tunnel to roughly 5,000 feet is billed as the centerpiece of the county’s flood mitigation plans. It would not only reduce water on the street but also mean the county would not need to demolish a series of historic buildings. Other projects viewed as priorities for the Safe & Sound plan include the creation of ponds to keep floodwaters away from the town, the renovation and removal of several buildings in the area and the construction of the Maryland Avenue Culvert. According to the county, it can be approved by the EPA for a loan that would equal nearly half of the overall cost of the Safe & Sound plan. The rest of the money would have to come from a combination of the county and other funding sources. “The federal WFIA loan, in addition to the $18.5 million Senator Hester and I obtained from the state legislature, will be the capstone for the completion of Safe and Sound Plan to enable Ellicott City to prosper another 250 years,” Delegate Courtney Watson said. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government If the loan is approved, the county could get its hands on that funding as soon as midway through 2022.

A senior year she was looking forward to after so many changes from the pandemic the two years prior. “It’s bad, it’s bad,” she said.   Now, no football season after what Koski says she saw posted on social media. Multiple students claim two football players held down another player as a third, older teammate used an item to sodomize that player held on the ground.   “I think it was gross. Really gross,” another high school senior, Tony Villebrun, said.   Students told WCCO it took days for school officials to find out as video and pictures circulated among classmates on Snapchat. “I think the dude that did it should definitely get punished for what he did,” Jayce Grover, a senior, said.   As the public awaits the findings of a police investigation, the station reports that the students in the video haven’t been seen in class since school leaders found out.There’s also been a show of support for the victim.   “I think Proctor has a bunch of good kids, and it’s not fair to lump everybody together over one’s actions,” Grover said.   “I don’t think they should have taken away everyone’s football season, give the rest of the kids a chance…they weren’t a part of it,” Koski added.   WCCO checked again Friday and the school board, superintendent and police are still not talking publicly about what happened. All are citing privacy laws for their decisions to stay quiet.

That’s just their mode of operation,” Fangio said. “Player safety is secondary.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Harbaugh,  who defended his decision following Sunday’s game , was seemingly unfazed by Fangio’s remarks. “I thought we were on good terms. We had a nice chat before the game. We’ve known each other for a long time,” Harbaugh said. “But I promise you, I’m not going to give that insult one second thought.” Harbaugh said he had made up his mind that the Ravens would take a shot at the record — set by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1977 — if they got the ball back. But he didn’t expect to get the ball back. Trailing by 16 with less than two minutes to go, Denver marched down the field and into the red zone. But with 10 seconds on the clock, Ravens corner Anthony Everett picked off Broncos quarterback Drew Lock in the end zone. As for any lingering questions about unwritten rules and sportsmanship, Harbaugh wasn’t having any of that, at least from a Denver team aiming for a garbage time touchdown.

That didn’t have anything to do with winning the game.”   Harbaugh said he wasn’t aware of a 16-point play so he questioned what Broncos throwing ball into end zone with 10 seconds left had to do with winning.   — Jeff Zrebiec (@jeffzrebiec)  October 4, 2021                                 ", "sentiment": 0.03506829088224437, "subjectivity": 0.40302694721299376, "wordcount": 477}

Here are the matchups going into the postseason: American League: READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts Wild Card: New York Yankees @ Boston Red Sox – Tuesday, October 5, 8:08 p.m. ET Division Series: Chicago White Sox @ Houston Astros – starts Thursday, October 7 Division Series: Yankees/Red Sox @ Tampa Bay Rays – starts Thursday, October 7 National League: Wild Card: St. Louis Cardinals @ Los Angeles Dodgers – Wednesday, October 6, 8:10 p.m. ET Division Series: Atlanta Braves @ Milwaukee Brewers – starts Friday, October 8 Division Series: Cardinals/Dodgers @ San Francisco Giants – starts Friday, October 8 In the wild card game, the winner advances to the division round, while the loser goes home. Each ALDS season will be best of five games. This week’s Baseball Report looks at the American League and National League playoff picture ahead of the wild card games. AL Playoff Picture The AL wild card race came right down to the final game of the season, with four teams all vying for two wild card spots. The Yankees led the way most of the last week with a game or two lead on the Red Sox. But by Sunday, the two teams were tied at 91-70, with the Blue Jays and Mariners each one game back. READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University The Yankees had already lost the first two games of a series with the Tampa Bay Rays, who had long since clinched the AL East. Another loss to the division winners could set up a potential game 163. Sunday’s game remained scoreless into the  ninth inning . Aaron Judge hit a one-out single in the bottom of the inning to drive home the winning run. It was the slugger’s first walk-off hit in the majors. The Red Sox needed a come-from-behind win to secure their spot in the wild card. For much of Sunday, it looked like Boston might need a 163rd game as well to have a shot at the postseason. But  they rallied  from 5-1 down to beat the Washington Nationals 7-5 and earn a playoff spot. They have the big bat of third baseman Rafael Devers largely to thank. He drove in four of Boston’s seven runs on the afternoon, including a two-run homer to put them ahead. The Blue Jays kept pace as well, with a 12-4 win over the hapless  Baltimore Orioles . George Springer led off the game with a home run, and Toronto never looked back. Springer would hit a grand slam later in the game as well. The Blue Jays needed the Yankees or Red Sox to lose to force a play-in game, but that didn’t happen. The Seattle Mariners, who lost Sunday, will also miss the postseason, stretching their playoff drought to  20 years . The Yankees and Red Sox play Tuesday night in Boston for the privilege of facing the Rays in the ALDS. The Rays led the AL East for the last two months of the season and weren’t really challenged in September. They’re the only American League team to reach 100 wins. The other ALDS series pits the  Chicago White Sox  against the Houston Astros. The White Sox have led the subpar AL Central for months as well. They finished off the season by winning six of their last seven games, but lost their season finale to the Detroit Tigers. The White Sox will travel to Houston to face the Astros. Division title already in hand, Houston held off the Oakland A’s in the final game of the season to finish with a record of 95-67. Their division series with the White Sox starts Thursday night. NL Playoff Picture The NL playoff race had its own excitement, as the two best teams in baseball (by record), fought for the division title in the West. The Giants have been the season’s  biggest surprise , and they finished with MLB’s best record. Most experts had them limping to a distant third, as the Dodgers and San Diego Padres fought it out in September. Many thought they wouldn’t top 80 wins and certainly wouldn’t sniff the postseason. Instead San Francisco held baseball’s best record for 125 days and were MLB’s first team to clinch a playoff spot. It took until the regular season’s final day to clinch the division though. The Giants won a franchise-record 107th game Sunday over a reeling San Diego club. The 11-4 win, helped along by  Buster Posey ‘s three RBI and two singles, including the 1,500th of his career, was their eighth win in the previous 10 games. The Dodgers were in hot pursuit of their ninth consecutive division title. But now they are forced into a wild card game with the St. Louis Cardinals. The winningest second-place team in MLB history walked all over the Milwaukee Brewers Sunday. Their 10-4 win included Trea Turner’s second grand slam in three days. Turner secured the NL batting title and is a strong candidate for the NL MVP. The Cardinals may be the hottest team in baseball at the moment. They beat the Brewers in six of seven games in the last couple weeks of the season, but couldn’t catch them in the division race. Losing two of the regular season’s final three games to the  Chicago Cubs  didn’t help. Their 90-72 record only earns them a trip to Los Angeles for a chance at an NLDS series with the Giants.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Court records show the boxer, whose case was listed on Monday’s docket in Baltimore City Circuit Court, is due back in court in March 2022. The charges stem from a crash that occurred about 2 a.m. Nov. 5, 2020.  Davis is accused of being behind the wheel of a Lamborghini  that ran a red light at the intersection of Washington and Martin Luther King boulevards, struck another vehicle and fled the scene. Four people inside the other vehicle were taken to an area hospital for treatment, but their injuries were not said to be serious. In exclusive video obtained by WJZ, the Lamborghini can be seen crashing into a fence. Then its occupants get out and take off.

Davis continues to prepare for his fights in the ring alongside this legal battle. If convicted on all 14 counts, he could face more than seven years in prison. It’s not the first time Davis has had a brush with the law. In February 2020, he was  charged with battery  after a viral video captured an alleged altercation with his ex-girlfriend. The video appeared to show Davis battering his ex-girlfriend, with whom he shares a child, while at a celebrity basketball game in Miami.

Though the year is not over yet, the Baltimore County Police Department acknowledged it has seen a significant increase. The agency attributes part of the elevated total to mental health issues. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured As of Oct. 4, the county has already seen 42 homicides. To put that in perspective, the county had a total of 33 homicides last year. Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. said the county remains a safe place to work, live and raise a family. But he said leaders are trying to place resources where they’re needed to keep residents safe. “I’ll be watching the news and look and think, ‘Oh my God, Baltimore County. Really?” said city resident Cathy Morrell, who has family living in the county. At this time last year, the county’s homicide total stood at 24, compared to 42 so far this year. Authorities attribute part of the increased violence to situations involving mental health or domestic disputes. “Twenty-four percent, almost a quarter of victims this year for homicide hade a behavioral health nexus associated with them,” said Baltimore County Police Chief Melissa Hyatt, who noted that 17 of 42 victims were killed as a result of an argument or domestic dispute. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The county has also seen two mass shootings — including one in Essex where police say a man killed two innocent bystanders inside a Royal Farms after killing his own family members. “These incidents can’t be prevented by law enforcement alone,” said Olszewski. “Which is why we’re taking action to expand behavioral health supports, expand the mobile crisis  team and adding clinicians to our 911 center.” Olszewski expects those changes to happen by the end of the year. Residents and officials say the issue isn’t isolated to Baltimore County but rather a byproduct of the pandemic and economic uncertainty. “This is not just a Baltimore County Police issue,” Chief Hyatt said. “It’s a societal issue that we need to have more resources dedicated to behavioral health.” Added Morrell: “With the pandemic, with things happening now, people not having jobs, people are desperate and people will do almost anything.” Other residents in the area spoke to WJZ and said they feel safe living in Baltimore County, saying they often see police patrolling neighborhoods day and night.

From cereal to soap, paper towels to pretzels, you might have noticed you’re not getting as much as you used to at the grocery store. Consumer blogs pointed WCCO to products like oatmeal packets of 10 cut to eight for some varieties, tuna cans from seven to five ounces, and some family size cereals slimming down from 19.3 ounces to 18.8 ounces, all evidence of inflation, or what’s known as shrinkflation. Kim Sovell, a marketing professor at the University of St. Thomas, says companies have learned how consumers don’t like to pay more. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “It’s really a way to conceal higher prices,” Sovell said. “We’re very deterred by price increases. We’ll switch brands. … We focus on cost over quantity. Cost over quality.” Unless you have an old box in your cabinet at home to compare, you might not notice. “We check prices every time we shop but we rarely check weight,” Sovell said. The world economy continues to struggle with pandemic woes, and if you haven’t noticed price hikes, Sovell expects it to be more pronounced soon. The maker of Huggies diapers and Cottonelle toilet paper announced it will charge 4% to 9% more through 2022. Proctor and Gamble, behind products like Gillette Razors and Tide detergent, is also looking at price spikes. “Any time we start slowing down manufacturing and shipping while in the U.S. demand for products is high, what we’re going to see is supply not being able to meet demand, which is a sure-fire way to have increased prices,” Sovell said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Sovell traces Shrinkflation back to the ’70s. Judging by the history books, she says the changes usually stick. For instance, orange juice used to come in half gallon or 64 ounce-containers. Also, Dial soap adapted its trademark concave shape. It’s all a way to give us less and in some cases, even charge us more. Breyers ice cream is another good example — 64 ounces have gone to 48. The price didn’t stay the same, either; it went up by 25%. “Being mindful and watchful of our usage is about the only thing we can do as consumers,” Sovell said. Sovell also believes tracking prices and sizes is key, spotting a practice that shouldn’t be a secret. “We’ll come to realize that maybe it isn’t necessarily devious or sneaky but necessary, necessary for business, necessary to keep providing us the products that we want to be able to use,” she said. Sovell also says shopping the sales, using coupons and rebates can also help. Buying in bulk can also sometimes work in your favor, but Sovell says it’s something you should also be weight conscious if implementing.

Hospitalizations have dropped, too. About 71,325 patients are hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, a 12.7% decrease compared to last week. “It does not signal the beginning of the end of this pandemic,” Rodriguez said Monday. “What it signals is that we are now on the downswing here of this latest surge, this Delta surge. But we’re still getting over 100,000 infections a day. And right now, the tide is higher than it was a year ago.” The daily Covid-19 death toll is a sobering reality check. Over the past week, an average of more than 1,800 Americans died from Covid-19 every day, according to Johns Hopkins. Health experts say  the vast majority of those deaths were preventable  with vaccination. ‘Let’s focus like a laser’ Whether Americans can gather more safely this holiday season largely depends upon actions taken now, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. “The best way to assure that we’ll be in good shape as we get into the winter would be to get more and more people vaccinated,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN Monday. Multiple times throughout the pandemic, Covid-19 numbers have dropped, only to surge again, sometimes with a new variant. “We’ve just got to concentrate on continuing to get those numbers down, and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we’re going to do at a particular time,” Fauci told CBS Sunday. “Let’s focus like a laser on continuing to get those cases down, and we can do it by people getting vaccinated.” As of Sunday, 55.9% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. Vaccines for younger kids might be within weeks The US Food and Drug Administration said Friday its vaccine advisers will meet October 26 to discuss data from Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine trial among children 5 to 11. That does not necessarily mean children in that age group can start getting shots right afterward. The FDA vaccine advisers would have to first make a recommendation, and the FDA would vote on it. Then, the CDC would have to sign off before children ages 5 to 11 could start getting vaccinated. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Some health experts say kids in that age group might be able to get their first shots by the end of October or November. But just like with adults, those children would need two doses. While children who get Covid-19 often have less severe cases than adults, kids can still be  vulnerable to serious illness and long-term effects , Fauci told CNN. He said those are important reasons to vaccinate children. “Look at the pediatric hospitals throughout the country, and you can ask any pediatric hospitalist, they’re seeing a lot of children in the hospital with severe infection,” Fauci told CNN on Monday. “So, although relatively speaking for the rest of the epidemic, it’s a lesser proportion, the fact is, it still can have a serious impact on children, not to mention the issue of long Covid,” Fauci said. The American Academy of Pediatrics reported Monday that new infections among children remains “exceptionally high,” now making up almost 27% of all new cases reported nationwide. Don’t rely on a past infection or an unauthorized pill Friday, the pharmaceutical company Merck said molnupiravir, an investigational antiviral drug made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics,  can reduce the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19 by half . But  full data from the molnupiravir trial had not yet been released or peer-reviewed . And it’s not clear if or when the pill might be authorized by the FDA to fight Covid-19. “It’s not an alternative to vaccination,” former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said. “We still have to try to get more people vaccinated.” Vaccination is still the best way to reduce the risk of infection, hospitalization and death from Covid-19, Fauci said. “The news of the efficacy of this particular antiviral (molnupiravir) is obviously very good news,” he said. “It decreased the risk — this pill did — of hospitalizations and deaths by 50%. You know the way to decrease the risk by 100%? Don’t get infected in the first place.” As for those assuming previous infection will keep them immune from Covid-19, a study published Friday in the journal The Lancet Microbe suggests protection may be short-lived. “Reinfection can reasonably happen in three months or less,” lead author Jeffrey Townsend, a professor of biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health, said in a news release. “Therefore, those who have been naturally infected should get vaccinated. Previous infection alone can offer very little long-term protection against subsequent infections,” he said.

He said there is a general consensus that the drivers need to be paid a living wage. “We won’t solve the shortage of drivers problem in this county until we address the fact that these jobs don’t pay a livable wage,” Pittman said. Pittman said he will attend a school board meeting at noon Tuesday to call on the board to change the way contracts are written with the bus companies the county enlists.

Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff, Roy McGrath, was indicted on federal fraud and embezzlement charges Tuesday after he received a severance payment of more than $200,000 to leave his job as CEO of Maryland Environmental Service for the governor’s office, and allegedly represented that Hogan had approved it. McGrath is charged with four counts of wire fraud and two counts of embezzlement. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured According to the indictment filed in the U.S. District Court, prosecutors allege McGrath falsely told the board of directors at Maryland Environmental Service that Hogan was OK with a severance payment of $233,647.23, his salary as chief executive, and falsely claimed he was taking a pay cut to work for the governor.   Among the charges the indictment alleges: he convinced the Maryland Environmental Service, where he was the Executive Director, to pay out a $233K severance. In an exchange with a board member, he “falsely responded” the governor was aware of the payout.  pic.twitter.com/duMziYf2Vw   — Paul Gessler (@PaulGessler)  October 5, 2021 McGrath was set to receive roughly the same salary working in the governor’s office, prosecutors said. According to the indictment, a member of the board texted McGrath about the payment to confirm the governor had approved it. “Hi, the HR committee wants to make sure that the governor would be OK with you receiving severance equal to one year’s pay,” the board member texted. “They are worried about the optics and don’t want to do anything to make the Governor look bad. I told them that I thought the governor was aware and was OK with it. Correct?” McGrath responded, “It’s anticipated, yes.” Additionally, McGrath allegedly had a subordinate at Maryland Environmental Service, a state-owned company providing water and wastewater management, composting, recycling and other services, pay $14,475 to cover his tuition in the Harvard Kennedy School Executive Program for classes that were scheduled to occur after he left his job. The subordinate was later reimbursed by the organization. Prosecutors also allege McGrath submitted timesheets that said he was working when he was really on vacation. Hogan  appointed  McGrath to serve as his chief of staff on May 26. Two days later, the board of directors at Maryland Environmental Service unanimously approved paying McGrath a severance of one year’s salary plus an additional $5,250 to cover tuition expenses. It also allowed him to keep using his agency-issued laptop and cell phone. In June, following the meeting, McGrath allegedly proposed the minutes from the board’s meeting be changed to say that a motion was made “that the Board enter closed session to discuss the compensation of a specific employees [sic] of Maryland Environmental Service,” according to the indictment. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn When Hogan asked about the severance payment in August, McGrath allegedly told him it was part of Maryland Environmental Service’s usual practice, according to the indictment. On Aug. 17, McGrath  resigned  days after it was learned he accepted the severance package. At the time, he dismissed the stories about the payment as “simply the sad politics of personal destruction.” He said he resigned because “we cannot afford unnecessary distractions” from the governor’s work.” Mike Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, said in a statement Tuesday: “These charges are very serious and deeply troubling. Marylanders deserve to know that their public officials are held to the highest ethical standards.” Ricci said the governor’s office assisted law enforcement agencies with their investigations. “We commend both federal and state prosecutors for their diligence and professionalism,” he said. “As this case moves to the courts, we are confident that the justice system will uphold the public trust.” In a statement, Thomas J. Sobocinski, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Baltimore field office, said McGrath’s alleged actions were self-serving and ultimately self-sabotaging.” State Prosecutor Charlton Howard III said his office filed a criminal information against McGrath that also alleges he illegally recorded private conversations with state officials. In Maryland, it’s illegal for someone to record a private conversation without first getting permission from everyone who’s part of that conversation.   McGrath is also facing 27 state charges (an array of misconduct and theft charges). He has a court appearance set for Oct. 25 in Anne Arundel Co.   State prosecutor alleges he “illegally recorded private conversations involving senior state officials without their permission.”  pic.twitter.com/9Pz26O15ZC   — Paul Gessler (@PaulGessler)  October 5, 2021 “Our office will seek to hold accountable any public official who abuses the privileges of their office for corrupt reasons or illicit personal gain,” Howard said. “The Office of the State Prosecutor will continue to work collaboratively with our partners to ensure the public’s interests are protected.” If convicted on the federal charges, McGrath faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each of four counts of wire fraud and a maximum of 10 years for each of two counts of embezzlement, Howard’s office said.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by .17% to 3.91%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 11 to 774. Of those hospitalized, 573 remain in acute care and 201 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 537,976 total confirmed cases and 10,282 deaths. There are 3,916,808 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,007,738 doses. Of those, 3,971,031 are first doses with 4,227 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,612,101 second doses, 3,816 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 304,707 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 336 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 119,899 additional or booster vaccine doses, 8,570 in the last day. The state reported 84.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

So the group organized Bailey’s Heart & Sole 5K Charity Run, which was held Sept. 19 at the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail.   Hundreds of people — including athletes from The John Carroll School, C.

As WJZ previously reported,  Burnham was named a suspect after Reynolds was found dead Sept. 29  with “obvious trauma” at a Cumberland home. Investigators believe he killed Reynolds, stole her car and drove it to Howard County. Authorities searching for Burnham found Reynolds’ stolen car Sept. 30 near the Robinettes’ Ellicott City home.

Burnham faces two counts of murder and a count of vehicle theft in Howard County.

(CBS4)  – One of the sickest COVID-19 patients in Weld County, Colorado is sharing his story from his ICU bed just days after the county recently ran out of ICU beds due to a spike of cases. Earl Henry, a retired construction worker, said his thoughts on the severity of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of the vaccine drastically changed after he contracted the virus.   Now, hooked to machines that help keep him alive in the ICU, Henry wanted to share his story with KCNC-TV in Denver in hopes of encouraging other self-proclaimed skeptics to reconsider their stance.   Earl Henry (credit: CBS)   “I, from the start, was a doubter. I was the head of the doubters. I doubted the vaccines. I doubted everything the media was saying. I thought it was just a circus,” Henry said. “Now I am standing in the back of the line with my hat in my hand. I have to admit, I was wrong. I was 100% wrong.”   Hospitalized in the ICU at UCHealth Greeley Hospital, Henry admitted he regrets not taking the pandemic more seriously. Thanks to the hardworking staff at UCHealth he was able to recover enough to share his story of survival. “It is one heck of a big deal. It is a whole lot bigger than I thought,” he said. “You’ve heard the old saying of the elephant sitting on your chest? Well, I had a whole pack of them.”   Henry said he started feeling sick last month and assumed it was simply just a seasonal cold or the flu. However, as symptoms increased in severity he ultimately decided to be evaluated at the hospital.   Thanks to the quick actions of UCHealth’s staff, Henry was stabilized in the ICU. He was able to avoid being placed on a ventilator. However, that does not mean his battle with the virus has been easy. “I wouldn’t wish this on anybody,” he said. “At one point in time I could’ve cared less if I woke up or stayed asleep.”   (credit: CBS)   During his time working in construction, Henry was buried alive multiple times. Dirt walls collapsed while he was in them, and much like a boa constrictor, the dirt gained a tighter grip on him every time he exhaled. Henry said the dirt would slowly squeeze the air out of him as time passed.   Much like that experience, Henry said COVID-19 seemed to do the same as he laid in his ICU bed gasping for air. Henry said he was taking deep breaths, however, it felt like there was no oxygen. “That’s what it felt like. It literally felt like I was being suffocated,” he said.   A self-proclaimed now-former skeptic, Henry regrets not being vaccinated as soon as he qualified.   “After having it. If I knew what I know now, I would have changed a whole lot of things,” he said. “Go get the shot. A needle poke in the dang arm beats the heck out of 12 days in the ICU and wondering if you are going to make it to see the next morning,”   Henry believes if he would have been vaccinated, he could have avoided the entire near-death experience. He also said he is open to getting all three doses of the Pfizer vaccine.   Now he is thanking his doctors and nurses for giving him another chance at life, and to once again return to his favorite hobby. “I feel 110% better than I did when this started. Way better,” Henry said. “I’d like to go fishing, I feel really good.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.07027191558441559, "subjectivity": 0.4333739177489177, "wordcount": 591}

The charges stem from a crime spree that began about 5 p.m. Monday when a BMW was seen driving erratically along Stevenson Lane. Police said things escalated when the BMW was involved in a hit-and-run crash on Osler Drive. A Baltimore County police officer called to the scene of the crash was assaulted by the BMW’s driver, who fled on foot afterward, according to police.

And, as a student, I am concerned for my safety.” Added senior Jun Ong: “I’m thinking about getting a protection keychain with a taser and stuff.” Following his arrest, Elzey was taken to the Baltimore County Jail where he’s being held without bond. A search of online court records found it isn’t the 19-year-old’s first run-in with the law. His criminal record included an attempted murder charge stemming from last December.

He took the boy to dinner and kissed him. He also showed the boy videos of two men having sex and suggested they do the same. In 2002, the Archdiocese of Baltimore revoked Cristancho’s ability to work as a priest, but a parishioner allowed him to hold religious services in their home, and the boy continued to work as a lector or altar server.

After Haugen’s alarming revelations  in her 60 Minutes interview  and a worldwide Facebook outage on Monday, technology analysts anticipate more fallout following her testimony.     “The choices being made inside of Facebook are disastrous for our children, for our public safety, for our privacy and for our democracy,” she told the subcommittee.   “Facebook consistently resolved these conflicts in favor of its own profits. The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats and more combat,” she continued. “In some cases this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people.”   Video: Haugen Testifies That ‘Facebook Knows’ It Leads Girls To Anorexia Content       “This is not a matter of certain social media users being angry or unstable. Or about one side being radicalized against the other. It is about Facebook deciding to grow at all costs.”   Video: Haugen Explains Mark Zuckerberg’s Role In Content Selection   Following her testimony, Facebook Policy Communications Director Lena Pietsch issued the following statement:   “Today, a Senate Commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former product manager at Facebook who worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives – and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question. We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about. Despite all this, we agree on one thing; it’s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet. It’s been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.”   Haugen stepped out of the shadows on Sunday night in an interview with CBS News “60 Minutes”, shedding light on the dark, murky, troubled world surrounding the Bay Area social media giant.     Watch The “60 Minutes” Interview    Haugen, who worked at Google and Pinterest before joining Facebook in 2019, anonymously filed complaints with federal law enforcement that the company’s own research shows how it magnifies hate and misinformation.   She had asked to work in an area of the company that fights misinformation, since she lost a friend to online conspiracy theories.   Haugen testified Tuesday morning before a Senate subcommittee, where she made an impassioned plea to lawmakers saying, “A company with control over our deepest thoughts, feelings and behaviors needs real oversight.”   Read Facebook Whistleblower’s SEC Complaints   “Congress, now the ball is actually in their court. What else do you want besides this?”   Two tech experts told KPIX 5 that Facebook has done such a poor job of regulating itself, it’s only a matter of time before the government steps in, and the thousands of pages of documents and research Haugen took from Facebook when she left could be the tipping point for Congress to finally act and create some sort of government oversight.   “These social media companies cannot police themselves. We’ve tried that before,” said San Jose State University professor Ahmed Banafa.   This all comes as Facebook and its other platforms Instagram and Whatsapp suffered massive outages for most of Monday.   “This is one of those things that seems awfully coincidental given that you have testimony going on tomorrow,” said Rob Enderle, a technology analyst.   Enderle thinks it’s only a matter of time before more Facebook employees come forward with other allegations.   “This is not an event that is so contained that only one person knows about it, and now that the whistleblower has come forward, government investigators will be looking for corroboration,” said Enderle.      Facebook’s response to “60 Minutes” Report      Quotes from the report:    On Why She Took Her Stand   “Imagine you know what’s going on inside of Facebook and you know no one on the outside knows. I knew what my future looked like if I continued to stay inside of Facebook, which is person after person after person has tackled this inside of Facebook and ground themselves to the ground.”    On The Dark World Of Social Media    “When we live in an information environment that is full of angry, hateful, polarizing content it erodes our civic trust, it erodes our faith in each other, it erodes our ability to want to care for each other, the version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world.”    On The Programming Of Facebook Algorithm    “So, you know, you have your phone. You might see only 100 pieces of content if you sit and scroll on for, you know, five minutes. But Facebook has thousands of options it could show you.”    On The Facebook Culture    “No one at Facebook is malevolent. But the incentives are misaligned, right? Like, Facebook makes more money when you consume more content. people enjoy engaging with things that elicit an emotional reaction. And the more anger that they get exposed to, the more they interact and the more they consume.”   Katie Nielsen contributed to this report.

Officials believe last year’s mild winter flu season was partly due to strict COVID-19 precautions. “We also know that there was a record number of vaccines from the flu shot distributed last year in the U.S.,” said Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. Now, the CDC says we could be facing a potentially early and severe flu season because of relaxed safety measures and the population’s reduced immunity to the virus due to low flu activity last year. “Everyone who is over 6 months of age should get vaccinated,” said Olszewski. “That certainly includes me” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn That’s why Baltimore County leaders rolled up their sleeves to get a flu shot Tuesday, as they announced the county’s annual Super Weekend flu clinics this month on Oct. 16 and 17. “The most important thing is to get vaccinated,” said Branch. “Do it for yourself, do it for your loved ones , do it for your community.” Swiss is already ahead of the game and got her flu shot last week, on top of being fully vaccinated against covid-19… “People haven’t been around each other, but now we’re starting to get together, and people are getting sick with colds and flu and things like that,” she said. Doctors say it is safe to get both COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same time. And now, it’s more important than ever to protect yourself from both. The free Super Weekend flu clinic will be held next weekend from 9 a.m. to noon at various locations in Baltimore County. Although walk-ins are welcome, appointments are recommended to get a flu shot. Residents can book a slot between by visiting  baltimorecountymd.gov/flu  or calling the Department of Health at 410-887-3816. On Saturday, Oct. 16, clinics will be held at the Drumcastle Government Center, Sollers Point Multi-Purpose Center, Hereford Middle School and Randallstown Community Center.

That is the whole point.” “The vaccines keep the infection that people have to quite mild symptoms,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist with Johns Hopkins.

(WJZ) —  The debate over COVID safety measures like masks was already a topic of debate. Now, a suggestion on mandating vaccines for children who are eligible could be stirring the pot once again. Just like any other school-required vaccine, Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman is calling on COVID-19 vaccines to be mandated to students, once available to those under the age of 12. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured This comes as 1,500 students in the county are currently in quarantine after COVID outbreaks in schools. “COVID should be added to the list of vaccines that our students are required to get to go to school,” said Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman. Pittman reaffirmed his support Tuesday to mandate vaccines for students saying the current number of COVID outbreaks in schools is concerning. “It really is unacceptable that so many children are being quarantined and kept out of school as a result of positive cases in the school,” said Pittman. This comes as the county’s public schools announced two weeks ago all teachers, support staff and high school student-athletes must be vaccinated or tested weekly by Nov. 22. But not everyone is on board with the idea. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I don’t agree with it. If that’s the case, my son won’t be going to school,” said parent, Chuck Tippett. Parents like Chuck Tippett say although he supports the vaccines, mandating them for all students goes too far. “What if they get a shot and in five years something goes wrong you know?” said Tippett. Right now 1,500 students and 30 staff members are in quarantine in the county, with 194 students and 23 staff members having active covid cases. “I’m just tired of the frustration of quarantining and the unnecessary fears,” said parent, Katie Getty. Katie Getty says she agrees students should be vaccinated, but the decision should be up to the parents. “I don’t know if i feel like its a good idea to mandate it. I think its great vaccines are going to be available to children and if you were to ask me today, I would choose to get my son vaccinated,” said Getty.

Provisional data from the CDC’s  National Center for Health Statistics , released early Wednesday, suggest the homicide rate for the United States rose 30% between 2019 and 2020. It is the highest increase recorded in modern history — and confirms through public health data a rise in homicides that so far had been identified only through crime statistics. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The previous largest increase in the US homicide rate was a 20% rise recorded from 2000 to 2001 because of the September 11 terror attacks, according to NCHS. “It is the largest increase in 100 years,” Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at NCHS, said. “The only larger increase since we’ve been recording these data occurred between 1904 and 1905, and that increase was most likely — at least partly — the result of better reporting,” Anderson told CNN. “We had states being added to what we refer to as the death registration areas, so we were counting deaths in more areas over time. We didn’t have all states reporting until 1933.” The new data show the US homicide rate increased from about six homicides per 100,000 people in 2019 to 7.8 per 100,000 in 2020, according to NCHS. Researchers at the center noted that the 2020 homicide rate of 7.8 is the highest recorded in the United States since 1995 but is still significantly lower than the rates in the early 1980s, which topped 10 homicides per 100,000 people. “So, it’s obviously of concern but we’re not at the levels that we were at that time,” Anderson said. “We’re heading in the wrong direction though, for sure.” While the initial release of the NCHS preliminary data did not provide a total number of homicides from 2020, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report recorded about 21,570 murders total last year — compared with an estimated  16,425 murders in 2019. The NCHS researchers plan to conduct follow-up analyses on the new homicide data for more insight into state-level data and how the homicides occurred. For instance, the provisional data do not document the various mechanisms of homicide, but the researchers noted that provisional data on gun-related deaths also increased last year, climbing from a rate of 11.9 firearm deaths per 100,000 in 2019 to 13.6 per 100,000 in 2020 — a 14% increase. When it comes to state-by-state differences in the data, Anderson said only three states appeared to have experienced decreases in homicides last year: Maine, New Mexico and Alaska. “Those are really the only states where we saw declines,” Anderson said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Overall, the provisional homicide data are consistent with separate findings by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Last month, the FBI released its annual  Uniform Crime Report  for 2020, showing that the number of homicides increased nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year increase the agency has recorded since it began tracking these crimes in the 1960s. The climbing US homicide rate is a concerning threat to the nation’s public health — but not surprising, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told CNN. He said the rise in homicides has occurred parallel to a recent rise in overall violence, hate, tensions, political divisions and anger displayed in communities across the country. “We’re literally seeing it in front of our eyes — at school board meetings and public events,” Benjamin said. “People seem to have lost all civility, and then you couple that with having to stay home, and being stressed from that, losing your job, losing resources, fear for your health, more guns,” he said. “I think we need to figure out how we de-conflict our society.” Earlier this year, criminology experts told CNN the increase in homicides was due to several factors. The pandemic closed schools and businesses, leading to unemployment. This meant children and unemployed adults were stuck at home, leading to skyrocketing stress and anxiety levels, especially in lower-income households. The pandemic also changed the way police officers do their jobs — because of illness and social distancing — which in turn led to fewer officers on the streets in areas that needed crime prevention the most. “I think Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Eddie Bocanegra, senior director of Readi Chicago, a program that looks to aid those most affected by gun violence,  said in January . “It’s almost like these communities were just having their heads above the water,” Bocanegra said, “and then Covid hit and they just sunk.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government The-CNN-Wire  ™ & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

(AP) —  Lumped into the “Other” racial and ethnic category, American Indians and Alaska Natives are effectively invisible on Maryland’s state website for COVID-19. More than 120,000 people who identify as Native American live in Maryland, but without public-facing numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is a mystery how many the disease has affected — and how many resources should be allocated to help them. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Not only is that bad public health, but it’s also very dehumanizing for American Indians and Alaska Natives on our native lands,” Kerry Hawk Lessard, executive director of the health services nonprofit Native American Lifelines of Baltimore, said to Capital News Service. The Maryland Department of Health puts American Indians and Alaska Natives in the “Other” category for COVID-19 cases and death numbers “due to low statistical occurrence given the population of Native Americans in the state,” department spokesperson Andy Owen wrote in an email to Capital News Service. However, American Indians and Alaska Natives are at the highest risk for death and hospitalization from COVID-19 among all races and ethnicities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There is no regulation that requires this manner of reporting,” Owen wrote, when asked if any regulation requires Maryland to put American Indians and Alaska Natives in the “Other” racial and ethnic category. Race and ethnicity are self-reported data points, Owen added. However, the Maryland Department of Health does not publish the number of self-identified Native Americans or Alaska Natives who contracted COVID-19 or died from the disease. Owen did not specify which other races and ethnicities are included in the “Other” category of the state’s COVID-19 dashboard. In Maryland, 31,845 people identify as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, comprising 0.5% of the state’s total population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. “So our lives don’t matter because there aren’t enough of us?” Hawk Lessard, who identifies as a descendant of Shawnee, Assiniboine, and European people, said to Capital News Service. An additional 96,805 people in Maryland identify as American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more races, according to a Capital News Service analysis of data from the 2020 census. This group comprises an additional 1.6% of the state’s total population. Nationally, American Indian or Alaska Native people are more likely to die from COVID-19 than any other race or ethnicity, according to a September CDC report. Compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts of a similar age, American Indian or Alaska Native people are 1.7 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19, 3.5 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 2.4 times more likely to die from the disease, the CDC found. In Maryland, “there is an invisibility to Native people that is amplified by the state’s refusal” to publish COVID-19 case and death numbers for American Indians and Alaska Natives, said Hawk Lessard, who also serves as a governor-appointed member of the Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs. “It means that we don’t know what the health status of Native people is,” Hawk Lessard said, which negatively impacts COVID-19 outreach, testing and vaccination efforts. Not all Maryland jurisdictions follow the state’s example. Baltimore City, for instance, includes “American Indian or Alaska Native” and “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander” as options in its COVID-19 dashboard, though the Maryland Department of Health does not. Jennifer Hunt, a civil servant for the federal government and a former board member of Native American Lifelines, helped convince the Baltimore City Health Department last year to begin publishing Native people’s COVID-19 data. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “We noticed that our race was not on the city dashboard,” said Hunt, who identifies as a descendant of the Choctaw tribe. In July 2020, Hunt co-wrote a letter with Baltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen requesting the city’s health commissioner to add American Indians and Alaska Natives to all data collection efforts. “Within 48 hours, we were up and running on the Baltimore City COVID dashboard,” Hunt said. The story is markedly different in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, where some of the largest Native populations in Maryland live, according to data from the 2020 census. Neither county’s COVID-19 dashboard lists “American Indian or Alaska Native” as a category. Like the state of Maryland, Montgomery County also puts Native people in the “Other” category. “Collapsing racial-ethnic groups with small cell counts is standard practice when reporting health data to avoid unintentionally identifying anyone,” Mary Anderson, a spokesperson for Montgomery County Health and Human Services, wrote in an email to Capital News Service. To comply with federal health privacy laws, the Montgomery County health department avoids publishing COVID-19 case and death numbers that are smaller than 25, Anderson explained. As of Sept. 15, there were 170 cases of COVID-19 among American Indians and Alaska Natives in Montgomery County, Anderson added. Though the case number was higher than 25, the county did not publish it. “The counts of cases among Native Americans were too small to allow for reporting when stratifying by other variables (age, sex, month, etc),” Anderson wrote. Adrian Dominguez, chief data officer at the Urban Indian Health Institute, told Capital News Service that he disagrees with the county’s decision to not publish the data. According to Dominguez, the department can publish the aggregate number — 170 COVID-19 cases among American Indians and Alaska Natives in Montgomery County — without publishing the smaller numbers corresponding to those individuals’ age, sex and month of infection. “Either they don’t know what they’re doing, or they’re intentionally not wanting to show this information,” Dominguez said. In addition to Maryland, 13 other states do not clearly publish data about American Indians and Alaska Natives in their COVID-19 dashboards, according to a February report by the Urban Indian Health Institute. The states are Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. “In a world where data is dollars, erasing people from data is essentially erasing them from the system,” Meredith Raimondi, director of congressional relations and public policy at the National Council for Urban Indian Health, said to Capital News Service. “If we don’t have adequate data to show this need is there, then the money won’t come and the resources won’t come…I’ve seen in the past year and a half how much it literally impacts lives,” Raimondi said.

The percentage of people testing positive remained at 3.91%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations increased by 14 to 788. Of those hospitalized, 579 remain in acute care and 209 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 539,053 total confirmed cases and 10,282 deaths. There are 3,919,726 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,020,703 doses. Of those, 3,974,294 are first doses with 3,263 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,614,715 second doses, 2,614 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,011 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 304 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 126,683 additional or booster vaccine doses, 6,784 in the last day. The state reported 84.1% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

On Thursday, October 7, a new single-camera comedy called “ Ghosts ” starring Utkarsh Ambudkar & Rose McIver premieres at 9pm EST/PST on CBS. The 30 minute comedy is about Samantha and Jay, who throw both caution and money to the wind when they decide to convert a huge rundown country estate they inherited into a bed & breakfast. The only problem is that it’s inhabited by the many spirits of deceased residents who now call it home. Actor Asher Grodman plays one of the ghosts on the show named Trevor. The departed souls range from a Prohibition lounge singer named Alberta to a slick 90s finance guy in Grodman’s character Trevor. CBS Local’s DJ Sixsmith chatted with Grodman about working on the show, providing comedy in this moment and working with Ambudkar.

Certainly, growth plate fractures should be diagnosed and treated promptly. Pediatric fractures in general heal differently than adult fractures and can affect a child’s future growth potential. Growth plate fractures pose additional risks—mainly the potential for a deformity that can develop months or perhaps years down the road—and can be hard to identify on a standard X-ray, making an examination by a pediatric orthopedist or other expert in children’s skeletal injuries more critical.   “In the long term, you can get limb length discrepancies or an angular deformity where part of the growth plate shuts down from the trauma and another part keeps growing. That’s the main thing you worry about after a growth plate fracture,” says Philip K. McClure, M.D., FAAOS, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon specializing in limb lengthening and reconstruction, and assistant director of the International Center for Limb Lengthening at the  Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics (RIAO) , a LifeBridge Health center.   However, a growth plate fracture isn’t as bleak as its name might suggest. Here’s why outcomes are often favorable with prompt attention and treatment even if a deformity eventually does develop:   What is a growth plate?   As can be inferred from the name, growth plates control how bones grow, determining their length and shape. Made up of cartilage, they are located at the ends of long bones (the thighbone and the metacarpal bones in your hands, for example), near joints. Growth plates disappear when a child reaches maturity (or has fully grown), but they are the last portion of children’s bones to harden, which is why they’re so susceptible to injury during the growth process.   A growth plate can fracture the same way a bone can fracture. Growth plate fractures are commonly caused by falls. They can also occur during participation in sports such as football, soccer or gymnastics. Also, they can occur gradually due to repetitive stress on the bone, which can result from overtraining. Recreational activities like skateboarding, biking and trampolining also put children at increased risk of a growth plate fracture.   Technically, all growing children are at risk of growth plate fractures, but boys more so than girls because it takes boys longer to finish growing. Growth plate fractures typically occur in the lower legs, forearms and fingers. The immediate symptoms—pain and swelling—will feel a lot like those of any other fracture, which is more reason for children to see an orthopedist or other skeletal growth specialist in the event of a fracture to determine if a growth plate has been damaged.   Is surgery necessary?   The risk of future problems resulting from growth plate fractures will depend on multiple factors, including the child’s age. Growth plate fractures tend to be less consequential if they occur near the end of growth. (Usually, growth plates in the arms and legs disappear at age 14 in girls and age 16 in boys.)   “A 16-year-old boy who suffers a growth plate fracture—once you get the fracture fixed and it heals, it’s unlikely to cause problems for him, whereas in a six-year-old boy, it can be a very different story because even if you get the fracture to heal and align nicely, the child still might require treatment down the line for a deformity,” McClure says.   That concern for what’s also known as a “growth arrest,” which can cause a bone to grow unevenly and become crooked even after a fracture heals, is why “some children should continue to have follow-up visits with a specialist until they’ve finished growing, into the late teenage years,” McClure says.   With proper treatment, most growth plate fractures heal without complications. And while all growth plate fractures need treatment, not all of them will require surgery. “Some sort of immobilization is almost always needed, but most growth plate fractures can be repositioned without surgery and then held in a cast while they heal,” McClure says.   Also, it is important to know that deformities can be corrected though a limb lengthening procedure or osteotomy (surgery that involves cutting and reshaping the bone).   “Some patients get the sense that if they develop a deformity, there’s nothing that can be done about it, but that’s not true. Even people who’ve had a deformity for 10 or 20 years can be corrected in most cases,” McClure says. “Deformities can be treated at almost any age, easily into a person’s 60s, though after longer periods of time arthritis and other complications can arise.”   RIAO has a Pediatric Fracture Clinic that offers same- and next-day appointments five days a week at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and on Mondays and Thursdays at Foundry Row in Owings Mills, Maryland.

(AP) —  From the moment doctors said she would have to undergo intensive foot surgery, Prince George’s County resident Janice Joyner knew she would have to pay for more than just a procedure. A mobility device was needed for her recovery. However, Joyner said, Medicare couldn’t cover the cost of the scooter. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “I was searching online for some kind of equipment that could help me and I didn’t want to pay an arm and a leg for it,” she said. After numerous Google searches, she said she came across the Maryland Durable Medical Equipment Re-Use Program. This program provides Maryland residents with donated equipment — such as wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, scooters and even pediatric equipment that have been sanitized and repaired — at no cost. Applicants do not have to meet any income requirements to receive equipment. Marylanders with any disability, illness or injury can receive this equipment regardless of age, according to the program website. Joyner said she thought the program was too good to be true. “At first I was skeptical (wondering) ‘Why is this place offering free resources?’,” she said. “But everything on there was true and I was amazed.” Disability healthcare costs in Maryland can reach as high as $21,118 per person each year, according to a 2019 Disability and Health Data report the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued. After a month and a half of mobility assistance, Joyner said, she plans on returning her scooter to the program’s headquarters for another person to use. “Before, I could only hop five steps to my bathroom and back,” she said. “Having this scooter made it possible for me to get out of bed. ” Ten percent of Maryland adults have a mobility-related disability, according to the CDC report. This makes it the highest reported disability among other types such as cognitive, self-care and independent living. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Program Director Ian Edwards said despite numerous attempts to raise awareness for this program, many people still don’t know it exists. “We started things up in January but with COVID fears, we weren’t really sure how the program would be perceived because it is previously used equipment,” he said. Once the majority of Marylanders received their vaccines, Edwards said more equipment started going out to the public in March. “We faced a lot of difficulties at the start,” he said. “But the equipment is (now) here and we have it ready for people who have no other means of obtaining it.” Edwards said the program has received over 5,000 items since collections began. Although the program does not currently deliver, he said they have multiple satellite sites around the state where people can pick up equipment. The program hosts 11 donation centers across the state, including three major landfills where people can drop off equipment. Edwards told Capital News Service that they partnered with county landfills to set up containers and raise awareness for the re-use program. He said while the program serves to help residents, they also want to ease financial strains among other contributors. “Whether it’s the healthcare system, hospital providers or even Medicare,” he said. “If we can save them money, with the inventory we have now, we’re hoping to help in any way.” Secretary of Aging Rona Kramer said Maryland is the first state to offer this statewide durable reuse program. “There are very few programs in the country that are this expansive,” she said. “We have the most sophisticated one. We are giving people their lives back.” More information about the program:  https://aging.maryland.gov/pages/DME.aspx MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

The department said motorists traveling in western Maryland should also watch for bears crossing roads in search of food. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The department provided these pointers to minimize bear problems on property:   Reduce garbage odors. Rinse food cans and wrappers before disposal.   Compost vegetable scraps properly away from house.   Keep meat scraps in the freezer until garbage pickup day.   Wash garbage cans regularly and use lime to cut odors.   Keep garbage cans in a bear-proof container or in an enclosed building until trash pickup.  See links to bear-proof cans above. ​   Remove bird feeders in the spring. If you persist in feeding during summer, remove seed, suet and hummingbird feeders at night.   Keep pet food inside.   Keep barbecue grills and picnic tables clean.   Use an energized fence to keep bears out of beehives, sweet corn, fruit trees and berry patches. (An energized fence is powered by a low-impedance, high–voltage energizer that provides a short-duration, high-energy impulse.)   Barking dogs, bright lights and noisemakers will sometimes discourage bears from coming into an area.   For more information on living around black bears,  visit the department’s website.

The Buffalo Bills have rattled off three impressive wins and are playing some of the best football of any team in the NFL. Given preseason expectations, that’s hardly surprising. What is surprising is their two-game lead on the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots and New York Jets all sit at 1-3. The Dolphins continue to struggle with Tua Tagovailoa on the mend. The Patriots are seeing progress from their young quarterback, even if it isn’t consistently showing up in the win column. And the Jets just pulled out a thriller. The Jets and Patriots each have a decent shot at their second win in Week 5. The Jets meet the 1-3 Atlanta Falcons in London, and the Patriots travel to Houston to play the 1-3 Texans. The Dolphins and Bills face more difficult matchups, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs respectively. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts SportsLine ‘s  Larry Hartstein  breaks down AFC East matchups in Week 5. All times listed are Eastern. New York Jets @ Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, October 10, 9:30 a.m. The New York Jets are coming off their first win of the season, a 27-24 overtime victory over the Tennessee Titans. They’ll look to carry that momentum into London, where they face the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons dropped another to the Washington Football Team, allowing quarterback Taylor Heinicke to throw two TD passes in the final four minutes. “If they [the Jets] can keep their emotions in check and not get too high after that big overtime win, I think they have a great chance,” said Hartstein. “The Falcons have given up the most points in the league. We saw how Washington put up a lot of points late in that game. The Falcons secondary is horrible. Zach Wilson made some bigtime throws. He has Jamison Crowder back as a safety blanket. He has Corey Davis making big plays.” Wilson is coming is coming off his best showing so far against the Titans. He piled up 297 yards passing, going 17-27 with two touchdowns. And aside from Crowder and Davis, Keelan Cole caught three passes for 92 yards. The Jets passing game will face a Falcons defense that can’t stop anybody from scoring. New England Patriots @ Houston Texans, Sunday, October 10, 1:00 p.m. The Patriots couldn’t overcome the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tom Brady’s return to Foxborough. Brady put together a fourth quarter drive to give the Bucs the lead. The Patriots had a shot at the win, but missed a 56-yard field goal rather than going for the first down. The Houston Texans are a step down from the Buccaneers. And Davis Mills, filling in for the injured Tyrod Taylor, is certainly no Brady. Mills went 19-28 for 168 yards against the Carolina Panthers and 11-21 for 87 yards and four interceptions against the Buffalo Bills. “Are they [the Patriots] going to get a big win over a Houston team that just got blown out 40-0 to Buffalo and looks like the worst team in the league because of their backup quarterback Davis Mills, who’s clearly not ready?” asked Hartstein. READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University “The Patriots are not an explosive team,” Hartstein continued. “You see them dink and dunk and matriculate their way down the field. They are not the kind of team that’s looking to put up 40 points. They don’t play that way. So this is a big number. I can’t play it right now. If you forced me, I would take the Patriots, just because of how bad Houston is. But I can’t play it because their offense is not explosive.” Mac Jones is steadily improving under center for the Patriots. And the Patriots are giving him plenty of opportunities to throw the ball, even if they’re mostly short passes. The Texans allow 8.1 yards per pass play, among the worst in the league. So this could be an opportunity for Jones to stretch the field a little. Mills, on the other hand, could be in for another long day against a Pats defense that successfully limited Brady. Miami Dolphins @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sunday, October 10, 1:00 p.m. The Dolphins have lost three straight and could easily be 0-4. The  Dolphins defense  is allowing 388.3 yards and 27.3 points per game, both in the NFL’s bottom 10. They’ve given up at least 20 consecutive points three weeks in a row. Brady will be looking to make it four weeks in a row. Topping the Patriots gave him at least one win over  every team  in the league. He also set the record for regular-season  passing yards  in a career, surpassing Drew Brees. Brady leads the NFL in passing yards this season with 1,356 and has tossed 10 TD passes against only two interceptions. “They [the Dolphins] have so many problems right now,” according to Hartstein. “Brian Flores basically saying everything is on the table. Jacoby Brissett has since taking over for Tua been averaging 4.9 yards per attempt. They only started going downfield late in that game, when they were already three scores behind to the Colts. So a lot of issues with the Dolphins offense. And I think the one thing you got to look at is Byron Jones. He’s their best corner. He left with a quad injury. If he can’t go against this Buccaneers team, which is loaded with pass catchers, with Mike Evans and [Chris] Godwin and Antonio Brown, it could be a very long day for the Dolphins.” Buffalo Bills @ Kansas City Chiefs, Sunday, October 10, 8:20 p.m. The Buffalo Bills head to Kansas City for a rematch of last season’s AFC championship game. The Chiefs won that game, but the Bills are playing better football this season. They are coming off a 40-0 trouncing of the Texans. Buffalo, at 3-1, is the only team in their division with a winning record. They’re averaging 33.5 points per game, second best in the NFL along with the Chiefs. Kansas City, however, sits at 2-2 after tough losses to the Baltimore Ravens and Los Angeles Chargers. “They [the Bills] have been the better team this year clearly,” said Hartstein. “The Chiefs give up the most yards per play in the league, 6.9. The Bills give up the fewest, 4.0. The Bills invested in their pass rush in the draft. It’s paying off. They’re number two in pressure rate. I think they can get a couple of stops on Patrick Mahomes, make him a little bit uncomfortable, so he puts up only in the high 20s, maybe 30. And Buffalo has been unstoppable, 43 points, 40 points, 35 points their last three games. This offense is what we thought it would be, so I’m definitely leaning towards the Bills.” The Kansas City defense will have trouble slowing this Buffalo offense. They’re allowing 437.8 yards and 31.3 points per game, both second worst in the NFL. By comparison, the Bills defense is allowing 216.8 yards and 11 points per game, both tops in the NFL. These stats don’t necessarily mean Buffalo be able to slow down Patrick Mahomes and his speedy wide receivers, not to mention Travis Kelce. But it does give them a better shot at coming up with a few key plays when it matters.

In fact, the study shows in schools with a mask mandate the number of kids infected daily, per 100,000, was about 16. That number is about 35 per100,000 kids in schools with no mandate. Some parents say masks don’t hurt. “They spread a lot of germs anyway, so whatever we can do to kind of eliminate as much of that as possible, I think, is really positive,” said Jasmine Mays-Robinson, who has school-aged children. Do masks stop the spread completely? No, but the chief medical information officer for LifeBridge Health said they help keep positive cases low. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “There still might be a positive kid here or there who has to be out for a week or two, but we haven’t seen it going rampantly through because most schools have been vigilant about masking and then quarantining if someone comes up positive,” said Dr. Jonathan Theirman. WJZ told you about  a rally in Carroll County , organized by parents fighting the mask mandate as their county was one of the only with optional masking before the state stepped in. Now, masks are  mandated in all Maryland public schools . Leaders in Prince George’s County are taking it a step further, now requiring everyone ages 2 and up to wear masks anywhere indoors. Previously, the mandate was for anyone 5 or older. “As a parent, I understand it, I get it, I know it’s not easy to mask younger children.

About 5 p.m. that day, police were called to an alleged road rage incident near Stevenson Lane after drivers reported seeing a BMW driving erratically. Authorities said things escalated when the vehicle was involved in a hit-and-run crash along Osler Drive, and the driver assaulted a responding officer.

In an exclusive interview Wednesday with WJZ, the mayor opened up about the symptoms he’s dealt with since getting his test results back. He also underscored the need for city residents to get vaccinated to avoid the worst effects of the infection. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “Yesterday, I had a few body aches, but today I feel totally normal,” Scott told WJZ. Besides those aches, the mayor — who had his last public event over the weekend at Patterson Park — said he hasn’t suffered from any other symptoms, such as fever or nausea. “Because of the vaccine, I’m able to do this interview at home and not in a hospital bed, not on the ventilator,” Scott said. Based on his experience, he encouraged everyone to do everything in their power to stay healthy amid the pandemic. That means undergoing testing and getting the vaccine if residents haven’t already done so. “Get tested,” Scott said. “Get vaccinated. Protect yourself at all costs.” As WJZ previously reported, the mayor was vaccinated against the virus in March. His positive test results make him part of the 1 percent of vaccinated Marylanders to get what’s known as a breakthrough case. It’s worth mentioning that the COVID-19 vaccine does not protect against infection. Rather, the vaccine is intended to ward off the worst effects of the virus and keep people out of the hospital. Asked if there was something he would do differently, Scott said he would step up his efforts to protect himself while out in public spaces. “For me, I guess it’d be taking my mask-wearing to the next level,” he said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The mayor, who is routinely tested, said he is grateful that testing regimen caught his infection early. He took a rapid test Monday morning, followed by a PCR test, which is considered the gold standard for tests. Last week, Scott attended a leadership conference in New York, traveling there by Amtrak train. He said mask usage was enforced in both spaces. He’s uncertain when he was exposed to the virus. But he suspects it might have occurred on Saturday, the day attended a groundbreaking where he alternated between wearing a mask and going without it. The next day, Scott attended the Parade of Latino Nations in East Baltimore. “When you see pictures of me outside without a mask, that’s very rare, too,” Scott said. “Even from some of the events over the weeks, folks are like, ‘He didn’t have on a mask.’ There are pictures of me at the same event with a mask,” he said. The mayor told WJZ he’s been cooperating with contracting tracing, which entails tracking down people with whom he had close contact over prolonged periods. Few people are considered close contacts. “Fifteen minutes, within six feet of each other, having a conversation. That’s that close contact, but not the quick passing, ‘Hi, bye,” said Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Dzirasa. Dr. Dzirasa said the mayor’s infection speaks to the need for unvaccinated residents to get the shot. “When we look at who’s been hospitalized with COVID-19, the vast majority are unvaccinated individuals. I actually think this is a reminder of how important it is to get vaccinated,” she said.

(WJZ)  — Manuel Barrueco knows how to make a guitar sing. After all, the classical guitarist first picked up the instrument six decades ago as a boy in Cuba. “The kids in my family were playing — my sisters, my cousins. I would just sit there and be mesmerized by it,” Barrueco said. “I just thought it was the (coolest) thing ever.” READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Barrueco, now 68, would emigrate to the United States with his family in 1967, an experience he remembers being painful as a teenager. “We were leaving everything behind, we came as refugees,” Barrueco said. “The Cuban government just took everything you had. And my sister, one of my sisters, was left there, and it was very difficult and very painful.” His family would eventually settle in Newark, New Jersey. But even as he witnessed his surroundings change dramatically, there always remained one constant: the guitar. “In times that I, maybe when I’ve gone through a difficult stage in my life, the guitar was there,” Barrueco said. “It gave me something to do and to concentrate on.” He would go on to study at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore. Eventually, he signed a record deal that allowed him to record music and perform around the world. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Barrueco’s most recent record earned him his fifth Grammy nomination, a milestone only sweetened by the fact that it was his first with his wife as a producer. “It’s great,” he said. “It’s actually great to enjoy others enjoying it.” Now, Barrueco works to spread his love for classical guitar as a teacher at the Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University, a prestigious conservatory and preparatory school for aspiring performers. “Somebody wrote once that music is what feelings sound like,” he said. “So, I would like to think that through music we can communicate feelings that you can’t with words. And maybe that is why the arts exist.” The Latin Grammy Awards is being held on Nov. 18. Barrueco’s Grammy-nominated record can be found on most streaming platforms.

CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to CBS Sports’ Adam Zucker about this week’s matchups including a clash of top 25 teams with Georgia and Auburn plus the number one team in the country, Alabama, heading to College Station to lock horns with the Aggies. #2 Georgia at #18 Auburn: Saturday, October 9, 3:30pm ET on CBS READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “It’s Georgia-Auburn and because it’s at Jordan-Hare Stadium, you never know what might happen. We enjoyed watching the prayer from a few years back on our show Tuesday. My favorite shot is when you see Aaron Murray on the Georgia bench after he had just led them to a presumed victory and he’ll actually be in the booth for us, so I’m sure they’re going to have some fun with that. The question is whether Bo Nix can create the kind of magic he did against LSU the other night when Auburn got their first win at Death Valley, since 1999. He was escaping guys like crazy and making making touchdowns and first downs out of it where in the past we used to see him get swallowed up or take monster losses. This Georgia defense, I mean, it’s as if Bo Nix is going from trying to escape a piranha to trying to escape an Orca or a great white shark. The Georgia defense is at a level that no other defense is at right now coming off two straight shout outs. Even if the Vanderbilt one doesn’t count in some people’s minds, the Arkansas, one has to. They’re allowing under five points per game, allowing a touchdown less than the next best team. Even if their offense isn’t fully complete, especially with JT Daniels banged up, their defense can win games on its own. They’ve now shut out two straight conference opponents for the first time since their title year 1980. For Auburn beyond the tricks of Nix has the second best average in the country, in terms of yards per carry. I’m not saying Tank Bigsby and Jarquez Hunter are Cadillac Williams and Ronnie Brown as a duo but they’re starting to pound out some serious yardage. Beyond the magic of Nix the other night the really impressive football came from those two cats. They also have a defense that’s pretty darn solid considering what they had to do to get a win at LSU, to almost win at Penn State, and some of the other games that we’ve seen him so far. I think Auburn can hang around, especially if they don’t make mistakes on their end of the field. Things can get pretty interesting especially because this is going to be Georgia’s first real tough road test. They had to go to Vanderbilt, the game against Clemson was a neutral site, now this this is a road environment that they haven’t had yet.” #1 Alabama at Texas A&M: Saturday, October 9, 8pm ET on CBS “First of all, I love that we’re gonna go from watching Georgia to watching Alabama because while Alabama is number one and the defending champs, a lot of my real diehard film watchers say that Georgia is a better team. Now we get to compare them, not against the same opponent, but we get to watch them on the same day, kick back and enjoy it. Alabama proved, once again, it’s pretty tough to fool them twice. Even though Ole Miss got them two years in a row a few years ago, for Alabama to go up 35  to nothing on Lane Kiffin where everyone had a feeling that Ole Miss could put up some points and really challenge them, that game was out of hand by halftime. If I were Jimbo Fisher, I would not say get your popcorn ready because he already had his big moment in the offseason when he was recorded saying we’re going to beat his a–, talking about Coach Saban. To me, this game is almost more about A&M than it is about ‘bama. We all thought A&M would be that second team behind Alabama and I think when you have that label it puts a target on your back. So not only is A&M 0-2 in conference play but their losses to Arkansas and Mississippi State are to the teams that were slated sixth and seventh and in the division to begin the season. So this is an ultimate gut check to me for Texas A&M in this spot because they better keep this thing close because it’s turning into disaster for Jimbo Fisher. For Alabama, they’ve taken some dings on the injury front and Brian Robinson may not be Najee Harris, but we saw that Alabama still has a guy who is going to put his head down and get a lot of tough yardage the way Najee used to, especially with the injury to Jase McClellan, The Alabama defense really made a big statement in that last game because after Ole Miss had a couple of those fourth down conversions and we thought it was getting interesting, they put a pretty strong stop to it. The defensive line was especially good while the DBs were making sure Matt Corral didn’t have anybody open.” Charlotte at FIU: Friday, October 8, 7pm ET on CBS Sports Network “Charlotte is a pretty interesting team to me, they beat Duke in early September, then they had a lead on Illinois this past weekend and right after missing the game tying field goal gave up an 80 yard touchdown so it got out of hand. With Chris Reynolds healthy Charlotte looks like a team that’s going to start to stick around and maybe rise up in the world, especially for their location. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn What’s interesting is they’ve never defeated FIU who’s 5-0 all time against them. FIU is in some trouble right now though they just gave up over 700 total yards to their rival Florida Atlantic and we we last saw them with that memorable upset over Miami a few years back but they’ve lost 10 straight now to FBS opponents. One guy that’ll be fun to watch for football fans is Max Bortenschlager, he’s the quarterback for FIU who transferred there after Taulia Tagovailoa came to Maryland, but we always enjoy saying his name. I don’t think we’ll be saying his name for a lot of good reasons, but he has put up a couple touchdowns in every game so far. I do think that Charlotte would have the edge in that game.” Northern Illinois at Toledo: Saturday, October 9, 12pm ET on CBS Sports Network “This is a tough call. Northern Illinois had a nice win over Georgia Tech to start the season and that’s a Georgia Tech team that has had its ups and downs but showed out in the loss to Clemson and really dominated North Carolina. Then on the other hand Toledo, I thought exposed Notre Dame before a lot of other teams did. They played Notre Dame tough it was a game, not seen on national television, the way we’re used to it. They’re now coming home from two straight road games. I think this is a huge game when it comes to the MAC. Toledo with homefield maybe has an edge there, and could claim that they’re more battle tested but I think that one’s going to go down to the wire.” #24 SMU at Navy: Saturday, October 9, 3:30pm ET on CBS Sports Network “I give Navy a shot in this one because of what they were able to do against UCF. It’s a group of guys who have had their backs to the wall and a coaching staff has already had some turmoil with the way Ivin Jasper was fired and then brought back after the loss to Air Force, which I think was an emotional moment at the academy, obviously. There’s an extreme contrast between these two teams, SMU is seventh in the country scoring 42 points a game, you have a quarterback in Tanner Mordecai who has thrown 24 touchdowns which is five more than Kenny Pickett for most in the country. Tanner Mordecai is actually even a little bit lower than these other guys in terms of yards per game and attempts per game but he’s thrown a touchdown every seven and a half attempts. He’s at like Barry Bonds or Babe Ruth home run proportions here. It’s a total contrast so I worry because Navy is outside the top 100 in scoring defense, it’s going to be really key for them to be able to run the ball the way they do. SMU is middle of the pack as a rush defense but Navy isn’t having a navy kind of year running the ball just yet. Navy could always make it interesting though because of how hard it is to go up against their offense.” Wyoming at Air Force: Saturday, October 9, 7pm ET on CBS Sports Network “I think that Air Force will win based on what I’ve seen from both teams. I love the Air Force rushing attack right now leading the nation in yards per game and rushing touchdowns because of the offense that they run. Haaziq Daniels, their quarterback, is around six yards a carry. Micah Davis is also going for nine yards a carry. Wyoming has been gritty and is undefeated for a reason though and this is their conference opener and they’re probably really happy to buckle their seatbelts into Mountain West play after a road escape at UConn and some wild finishes that they’ve already had. Now they’ve had a week off following that, I think they get to hit reset and sink into conference play.” New Mexico State at Nevada: Saturday, October 9, 10:30pm on CBS Sports Network “This should be an easy game for Nevada and I don’t mean to take away from New Mexico State’s effort  and kids on the team trying to make football happen. Nevada’s only loss was in a visit to a tough Kansas State team who nearly beat Oklahoma, who did beat a Stanford team that’s completely turned the PAC-12 upside down. They just got a win at Boise State which used to be impossible and I love their offensive balance because of Carson strong and now Toa Taua coming off his best game of the season going for 124 yards at Boise. I think that Nevada should look at this as a way to get some other players on the field and avoid mistakes and treat it like a live tune up for the games they have coming up against Jake Haener and Fresno State on the road and a Hawaii team that just showed what they can do by beating Fresno State and causing six turnovers in that one. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government The Mountain West, between Nevada and those teams I just mentioned, but also Wyoming and Air Force have shown the Mountain West is going to be really entertaining to watch as we head into the fall.”                                 ", "sentiment": 0.13096268810554532, "subjectivity": 0.4957334112096022, "wordcount": 1896}

(AP)   —  The Baltimore Ravens still look like contenders after four weeks — no small feat considering all of their injuries and the fact that three of their first four games were on the road. Now the schedule shifts in a pretty dramatic way. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The Ravens won at Denver on Sunday for their third straight victory, and they don’t have another road game until Nov. 11. In between, they’ll play four consecutive games at home, with an open date in the middle of that. It remains to be seen whether Baltimore can take advantage, but at least from a logistical standpoint, this figures to be a pretty comfortable stretch. Next up for the Ravens is a game against Indianapolis on Monday night. “Definitely will be good to get back in front of our home crowd and get some of their energy,” receiver Devin Duvernay said Wednesday. “That’s felt like a while since we’ve been at home, so definitely excited.” Since the 1970 merger — and not including the strike-shortened 1982 season — the longest a team has gone between road games was 45 days, according to Sportradar. That was in 2016, when Miami played at Cincinnati on Sept. 29, then had four home games and an open date — same as this year’s Ravens — before a road game against San Diego on Nov. 13. The gap for Baltimore will be 39 days. The home games will be against the Colts, Chargers, Bengals and Vikings. It’s an opportunity for the Ravens to build on their 3-1 start, although coach John Harbaugh doesn’t want to put too much stock in the idea of using this stretch to build momentum. “Big picture, you might,” he said. “I would just kind of count on you guys to write about that stuff, really. For us, we just have to go to work on the next day, and our preparation for a very good Colts team. … We have our hands full coming up Monday night, and that’s all we’ll be thinking about.” Last year, Pittsburgh had a stretch similar to Baltimore’s — four home games with an open date early in the season. The Steelers won all four of those games on their way to an 11-0 start. When Miami had the four home games in 2016, it won three of them and ultimately made the playoffs at 10-6. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn At the other end of the spectrum were the 2015 Tennessee Titans. They had four home games and an open date in a five-week stretch, and they went 0-4. They finished 3-13. So taking advantage of this stretch could be crucial for Baltimore, and Monday’s game will be the third night game for the Ravens already this season. Their first home game — a win over Kansas City in Week 2 — was on a Sunday night. Baltimore is 16-2 in home primetime games under Harbaugh. “It’s just a stage for you to show what you’ve been working hard for,” rookie linebacker Odafe Oweh said. “That’s the most fun part of it for me, just letting people know who you are and what you’ve done your whole life. It’s not just training camp, it’s what you’ve been working to your whole life. So that’s just a stage to perform.” The outlook for the Ravens has changed considerably in the past three weeks. Baltimore has had significant injury problems in the backfield and secondary and on the offensive line, and the Ravens dropped their opening game at Las Vegas. They rebounded with a win over Kansas City, but then they needed a 66-yard field goal by Justin Tucker to get past Detroit on the road. Last weekend’s 23-7 win at Denver was a better all-around performance, and now the Ravens are starting to look a little healthier. Receiver Rashod Bateman, a first-round draft pick this year, could make his debut soon after being out with groin problems. The Ravens don’t want to be complacent, though, even with all these home games coming up. “I don’t think anyone’s relaxed,” offensive lineman Patrick Mekari said. “We’re just locked in on the next win. It’s unfortunate the amount of injuries we had, but we’re fighting for those guys.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased by 0.02% to 3.89%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations remained at 792. Of those hospitalized, 577 remain in acute care and 209 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 540,451 total confirmed cases and 10,320 deaths. There are 3,925,281 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,044,296 doses. Of those, 3,979,978 are first doses with 5,684 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,620,024 second doses, 5,309 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,257 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 247 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 139,037 additional or booster vaccine doses, 12,354 in the last day. The state reported 84.3% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

(WJZ) —  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday announced a five-point framework to use the state’s $2.5 billion budget surplus. The surplus, announced by Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot last week, is about 25 times the amount of money the state usually has left over. The bulk of the surplus was attributed to stimulus funding and higher-than-anticipated tax collections. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Democrats on Wednesday called for the money to be spent on those most in need,  families who are struggling to make ends meet and facing eviction. “Already some politicians see this (surplus) as a chance to go on a big spending spree with pet projects, big payouts to special interests and new mandated increases in spending,” Hogan said Thursday. “That is not going to happen on my watch.” Hogan said his plan would entail the following: increasing the state’s reserves, providing major tax relief for retirees and direct tax relief to Marylanders in general   Increasing the state’s reserves, or Rainy Day fund;   Providing major tax relief for the state’s retirees;   Offering direct tax relief to Marylanders in general;   Giving additional relief to underserved residents;   And boosting pay for state employees.   The state aims to shore up the Rainy Day fund by at least 7.5% to $1.67 billion. Hogan described tax relief for retirees as a priority — and the only way to keep them from leaving Maryland for states with lower taxes. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Cutting retirement taxes is one of the most important things we can do and something we have been trying to accomplish for seven years. But the legislature has failed to support this critical relief for seniors,” Hogan said. “Each year when I have proposed it. Legislators have spent almost immediately rejected it saying that we can’t afford it. Now with our fiscal health stronger than ever before, what we cannot afford is failing again to take immediate action to ease the crippling tax burden on our retirees.” Hogan said as the state puts its budget together it will continue to provide additional, targeted relief for those Marylanders who need it the most. He did not specify whether that measure fall in line with Democrats’ call to action. The governor also spoke to the need to properly compensate state employees who “have been unwavering in their commitment throughout our COVID-19 response.” He said his budgetary plan demonstrates an effort to practice fiscal discipline while prioritizing relief. “My message is pretty simple,” Hogan said. “As long as I am governor, I will continue to fight for fiscal discipline. I will continue working hard every single day to make it easier for Maryland families, small businesses and retirees to stay in our state, and I will continue fighting to allow Marylanders to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pockets, so that we can continue changing Maryland for the better.”   MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government                                   ", "sentiment": 0.07457415772633165, "subjectivity": 0.4300159984942594, "wordcount": 512}

Here’s what happened this week…   Photo Courtesy of CBS   READ MORE:  ‘Survivor 41’: Episode 2 Recap: Introducing A New Advantage! Yase Tribe In this episode, we’re introduced to an entirely new “Beware Advantage.” On the Yase tribe, Liana was the first one near this advantage while reflecting by the fire. But, since her mind was elsewhere, she didn’t even notice it. This “Beware Advantage” was wrapped up in an envelope sitting pretty right by the campfire. Shortly after Liana missed it, Tiffany found it in clear sight while she was tending the fire. Tiffany immediately let her alliance, both Evvie and Liana, in on this brand new twist. This week’s “Beware Advantage” was different from the last one. The advantage said,  ‘you must get on the boat, or you’ll lose your vote.’  This boat would arrive late into the night, where the castaway would then have to sneak onto it and proceed to the next task. But, what happens next – is the risky part. Tiffany, without a doubt, took the risk and later on snuck onto this boat… Luvu Tribe  At the Luvu tribe, the castaways feel the most uneasy about Naseer. On one hand, they value his strength and survival skills. But, the thing is, Naseer is also throwing people’s names around without any clear strategy behind it. Sydney, who’s heard Naseer say that he wants either Deshawn and Danny voted off next, feels the most anxious about his game. But, since her guard was up, she noticed something faster than the rest of her tribe – the infamous “Beware Advantage” envelope. She keeps the advantage to herself and also sneaks off at night…   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Their tribe’s Beware Advantage was also laying around camp – just sitting there, clear as day. As a fan, I’m just wondering – why were these advantages so easy to find?! Hm… it just goes to show,  Survivor  producers are not messin’ around this season! Ua Tribe  Meanwhile, there was one castaway, in particular, who was granted the  Survivor  ‘advantage-lottery winner’ in this episode – and that was good ol’ cattle rancher, Brad. Brad was on fire this episode.  (Not literally  –  um, even though   that actually happened before back in season two).  While the rest of the castaways were sitting by the beach early in the morning, Brad found the “Beware Advantage” right by his feet (again, not hidden whatsoever). Brad was stoked. You can tell how much he loves this game by saying he is “lovin’ all the danger” of  Survivor . So, he, of course, agrees to take the risk and sneak off later into the night. But, before he did that – Brad continued to play  Survivor  the way  Survivor  is meant to be played! While everyone was curious about whether or not the Hidden Immunity Idol was already found, little did they know – Brad was holding it in his pocket the whole time. Yep. Brad did it again! Before sneaking off to participate in his first “Beware Advantage,” Brad found the 3-way shared Immunity Idol that was first introduced in last week’s episode. Last week, Xander from the Yase tribe found his first 3-way shared Immunity Idol. As a reminder, these 3-way Hidden Immunity Idols can only activate if all three of them are found at each camp. Now, Brad found his at the Ua camp. But, there’s still a catch – like Xander in last week’s episode, Brad, too, has to say a “secret phrase” at the next Immunity Challenge to indicate he found his third of the idol. Brad’s secret phrase is: “I didn’t realize this till now, but broccoli is just a bunch of small trees.” …man, do these phrases just get better and better. Now, Brad is holding two very valuable advantages in his game. To solidify his trust, he aligns himself with both Genie and Shan, and tells them all his secrets… especially now since he cannot vote until all three of the idols are found. Was sharing all his secrets a smart move for Brad? At this point – I’ll say, I was genuinely impressed with how Brad was playing this game!   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Beware Advantage  After each of the three castaways, Tiffany, Sydney, and Brad, found their (not so hidden) “Beware Advantage,” they all stepped onto a boat and separately arrived at another island late into the night. This was a risk itself because each member had to make this trip both fast and efficiently so they wouldn’t get caught by the rest of the tribe. Brad even went to the lengths of putting shoes on a few logs to look like he was still sleeping! READ MORE:  ‘Survivor 41’ Episode 1 Recap: Two Eliminations, One Summit The three instantly had an important decision to make. Like the  Survivor  Summits, they each had a choice to risk their next vote in order to gain a “steal a vote advantage.” The decision was between choosing either a tarp for the entire tribe or a “steal a vote advantage.” Before making their decision, the three got the chance to discuss with one another. Of course, all three of them wanted to gain a “steal a vote.” The thing is, if all three of them selected it, they’d all lose their vote. If all three chose a tarp, they’d all get a tarp. But, if just one person selects a tarp – then whoever chose the “steal a vote” option would receive that advantage. Make sense? ..Eh, I know, it’s sorta hard to keep up with these advantages. Okay, so here’s how it went down. As the three were chatting about what to do, Sydney began to feel weird about Tiffany’s intense demeanor. She didn’t trust her, and she chose “tarp” so she wouldn’t lose her vote. But, because Tiffany picked up on this “uneasy” vibe between her and Sydney, Tiffany got nervous as well, and also chose the tarp. Since Brad already lost his vote from finding his in-active Hidden Immunity Idol – he, of course, decided the “steal a vote option.” This means both Tiffany and Sydney didn’t receive a tarp, but Brad did get his “steal a vote” advantage! Brad now has gained three advantages just from this episode alone.

And by the way these castaways were salivating; you’d think they were looking at a slab of ribs… seemed like a much-needed reward to win!! But first, just like the hilarious outburst in last week’s episode, both Xander and Brad snuck in their secret phrases to sign they found their third of the Immunity Idol:   This keeps getting better and better! 😂👏🏽🦋🥦  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/HzZz0zNGZH   — SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 7, 2021 … even though Brad butchered his phrase, Xander understood the sign. Unfortunately, the two need just one more person from the Luvu tribe to find theirs to activate their idols. Until then, the two cannot vote at the next Tribal.   Photo Courtesy of CBS   During the challenge, the tribes were pretty even. One at a time, the castaways would have to swim across to a platform in the ocean, make their way across a rope balance beam, and swim to shore. After all of the castaways were on the beach, they’d have to dig up a big bag that carried multiple sandbags and bring it even further into the beach. And finally, to win the challenge, the tribes needed to toss their small sandbags onto a set of posts. First two tribes to finish, win both immunity and reward! As mentioned, it was a tight race – but it was JD who dropped the ball (or should I say sandbag) for the Ua tribe and lost. Both the Luvu and Yase tribes won immunity this week!   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Tribal Council Both Brad and JD are on the chopping block at this point. Shan, who’s been playing strategy this entire game so far, is the deciding vote once again. Brad and Genie are showing Shan every reason for her to trust them  (let’s not forget Brad showing her all his secret gadgets to advance their game!)  But, the thing is, Brad cannot vote and cannot use his “steal a vote” because so. He’s really putting his trust in Shan and Genie as he wants to get JD out next. There’s also Ricard, but he doesn’t trust Genie since she put his name down at the first Tribal Council. Because of this, Ricard is mostly aligning himself with Shan as well. And then, there’s JD – who thinks he has a strong alliance with Shan and Ricard… that is until he gets caught lying. Yep. Remember when JD received an extra vote from the  Survivor  Summit? Well, he’s been lying to his alliance – keeping the extra vote advantage info from Shan. Just before Tribal Council, Shan noticed the advantage paper in his pants and confronted him right away. So, JD says he must “come clean” to her and Ricard…   There’s a difference! 😬  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/UIEZL0vbIw   — SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 7, 2021 This pissed off Shan. She knows she now can’t trust JD at all. So, to gain a little trust back in her eyes, she asks JD if she can hold onto his extra vote as his “punishment.” He gives it to her – no questions asked. But in the end, I was disappointed. Brad was completely blindsided! Shan ultimately decided he just had too much power in his pockets, and he was the next to get voted out.   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Ahhh – I was so bummed to see Brad go! He was playing so well in this episode. It just shows that you can’t trust anyone in this game. Brad simply put his fate into the wrong hands and got ahead of himself… What’d you think of this week’s vote?

Sometimes you just throw it down the toilet.” Moninger says that the key is to keep them out of your home in the first place and sealing all the cracks they can slip through is tough. “We do a treatment that not only hits the base of the house but around all the windows and the eaves of the home,” he says. “This puts a preventative barrier that’s about 85 to 90%, protective, from those guys getting into the home.” There is no question a run of warm days and cool nights is the perfect recipe for infiltration. “As the temperatures fall in the evenings, we’re right around 50 or below stinkbugs, ladybugs, houseflies, all of those pests are trying to get into your home to go dormant for the fall and winter,” Moninger says. While stink bug traps will work, Moninger warns you not to put them too close to your home or the trap might become an invitation to bring them even closer to your home. You may catch some, but others will just fly by and into your cracks. WATCH: Keeping Stink Bugs Out Of Your Home   Also seeking out those cracks these days are mice. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Moninger says one spot you might check is where tubes and power cords for your air conditioner come through the wall. “Look inside your garage from the inside with a light out, and if you see the light of day coming through the corners of your garage doors that obviously means the mouse can fit through that area too,” he explains. Check under your sink where the pipes come up out of the floor. “If there’s a big opening there, or even again a small as a nickel, that mouse can work its way up and follow that water line into the kitchen,” Moninger says. So those holes need to be plugged. “Position, stainless steel wool that has slivers of stainless steel in them,” Moninger recommends. “Remember rodents going off of the whiskers. So when they feel that thing it’s still that little sliver that will make them turn from that area.” As for repellants, “over the years, I’ve had everything from peppermint the cinnamon to lavender dryer sheets. I’ve heard it all. Sometimes, you just have to do it and do it right.” Meaning: seal the cracks and watch for evidence. If you see mouse droppings, set traps until you are not catching anything.

Episode three of the most monstrous  Survivor  season yet introduced another new game play mechanic and saw the fourth elimination so far – Brad Reese. CBS’ Matt Weiss spoke to Reese about his time on the island, speaking in code and whether or not the Wyoming native would give  Survivor  another go. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured MW-  Good morning, Brad! How are you doing? BR-  Hey, very good Matt, considering [laughs]. MW-  Glad you’re in good spirits! Obviously you’re a huge fan of  Survivor  and I love the quote that, “you’re loving all the danger.” How did you feel when you finally got to the island? BR-  Yes, so through all the quarantines, through all the pre-game COVID testing, when you got on the island it was just this rush of energy that just bursted out. It was like finally we’re here, we’re gonna pull this off. You never knew with all the COVID testing if you were going to be gone. There was just a lot of uncertainty and once I hit the island it was like, ‘ah this feels great,’ I’m here! MW-  I’m sure you prepared to go on the show but once you’re actually there and you’re tired and you’re hungry, did you feel like you prepared enough or was there a feeling of being in over your head? BR-  Yeah, no, I felt maybe a little bit too comfortable. I love the country, I love the elements being thrown at me. Let me dig and salvage and scrap and eat worms and just go. I felt good. What I didn’t feel prepared for was that first loss in the immunity challenge. I was not prepared for that five hour scramble of passing the boat and that killed me, that was hard on me. MW-  We saw the introduction of the Beware Advantage last night. So I know you felt pretty prepared but when those twists get thrown in how difficult is it to think on the spot and process that new information? BR-  yes, I was a little disappointed in myself. I thought about it and maybe I can blame the lack of food and calories because I didn’t quite process how how brutal that was. I knew I was helpless, I knew I had all my power stripped and I was in trouble,  but I was not quite prepared for that. I hadn’t seen through that part of it. MW-  One of my favorite moments from last night was you and Xander communicating through codewords. Can you walk me through that? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn BR-  Oh yeah, I loved it. You know I completely messed up my statement, completely butchered it, so I’m feeling bad. The challenge was and your emotions are high, your energy’s high. Then there’s Xander, and it didn’t even cross my mind, but he leans over and says ‘like what you said about the broccoli.’ I was like dude, yes, you and I have this little connection and that’s what you’re looking for in this game is any little connection. He looked like such a cool dude right there and all of  a sudden he and I have this connection and I was very excited about it at the time. MW-  Now the part I’m sorry to bring up but we get to tribal council, things don’t go your way, can you walk me through how things went from your perspective? BR-  It was total slow motion, Matt. I felt like things were in slow motion and I was thinking oh, JD is not nervous, this is not going well for me. Next I was just trying to think what can I do, what can I do, and came up with a blank, I can do nothing. I had no immunity, no shot in the dark, I’ve got nothing but Genie. All I had was Genie, and I’m like, can I give her my steal a vote, I don’t know if that would help? My mind was just kind of moving too slow. When you you picture yourself out there and you put yourself in these situations you think I’ll go to a tribal and fight for any chance I can get to win. I did not prepare for that situation though, if I have all my power stripped on a five person council, only four votes left; I did not prepare for that. I just couldn’t move like I wanted to. MW-  A lot of fans were sorry to see you go, any chance we’ll see you out there for another round? BR-  Great question, I feel like I’ve had my shot, I took my turn. I loved every second of it and if Jeff called me I absolutely would say yes man, sign me up, I’ll go tomorrow. I also feel like man, I had my shot, I love  Survivor , but I had my chance. I look at the seven days I had and I feel like I lived a whole season worth of game play. I’m catching some flak from people saying I played too strong, too sloppy but I got no regrets. I had my people in position, I was playing the game I wanted. I feel like that monster that Jeff keeps talking about, that’s what it really was. If I had been powered up I think it would have been a different outcome last night, I could have outran that monster. MW-  It’s been a monster for sure. Thank you so much for the time today Brad, great to talk to you and all the best moving forward! BR-  Awesome, thank you Matt pleasure.

Here’s what happened this week…   Photo Courtesy of CBS   READ MORE:  ‘Survivor 41’: Episode 2 Recap: Introducing A New Advantage! Yase Tribe In this episode, we’re introduced to an entirely new “Beware Advantage.” On the Yase tribe, Liana was the first one near this advantage while reflecting by the fire. But, since her mind was elsewhere, she didn’t even notice it. This “Beware Advantage” was wrapped up in an envelope sitting pretty right by the campfire. Shortly after Liana missed it, Tiffany found it in clear sight while she was tending the fire. Tiffany immediately let her alliance, both Evvie and Liana, in on this brand new twist. This week’s “Beware Advantage” was different from the last one. The advantage said,  ‘you must get on the boat, or you’ll lose your vote.’  This boat would arrive late into the night, where the castaway would then have to sneak onto it and proceed to the next task. But, what happens next – is the risky part. Tiffany, without a doubt, took the risk and later on snuck onto this boat… Luvu Tribe  At the Luvu tribe, the castaways feel the most uneasy about Naseer. On one hand, they value his strength and survival skills. But, the thing is, Naseer is also throwing people’s names around without any clear strategy behind it. Sydney, who’s heard Naseer say that he wants either Deshawn and Danny voted off next, feels the most anxious about his game. But, since her guard was up, she noticed something faster than the rest of her tribe – the infamous “Beware Advantage” envelope. She keeps the advantage to herself and also sneaks off at night…   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Their tribe’s Beware Advantage was also laying around camp – just sitting there, clear as day. As a fan, I’m just wondering – why were these advantages so easy to find?! Hm… it just goes to show,  Survivor  producers are not messin’ around this season! Ua Tribe  Meanwhile, there was one castaway, in particular, who was granted the  Survivor  ‘advantage-lottery winner’ in this episode – and that was good ol’ cattle rancher, Brad. Brad was on fire this episode.  (Not literally  –  um, even though   that actually happened before back in season two).  While the rest of the castaways were sitting by the beach early in the morning, Brad found the “Beware Advantage” right by his feet (again, not hidden whatsoever). Brad was stoked. You can tell how much he loves this game by saying he is “lovin’ all the danger” of  Survivor . So, he, of course, agrees to take the risk and sneak off later into the night. But, before he did that – Brad continued to play  Survivor  the way  Survivor  is meant to be played! While everyone was curious about whether or not the Hidden Immunity Idol was already found, little did they know – Brad was holding it in his pocket the whole time. Yep. Brad did it again! Before sneaking off to participate in his first “Beware Advantage,” Brad found the 3-way shared Immunity Idol that was first introduced in last week’s episode. Last week, Xander from the Yase tribe found his first 3-way shared Immunity Idol. As a reminder, these 3-way Hidden Immunity Idols can only activate if all three of them are found at each camp. Now, Brad found his at the Ua camp. But, there’s still a catch – like Xander in last week’s episode, Brad, too, has to say a “secret phrase” at the next Immunity Challenge to indicate he found his third of the idol. Brad’s secret phrase is: “I didn’t realize this till now, but broccoli is just a bunch of small trees.” …man, do these phrases just get better and better. Now, Brad is holding two very valuable advantages in his game. To solidify his trust, he aligns himself with both Genie and Shan, and tells them all his secrets… especially now since he cannot vote until all three of the idols are found. Was sharing all his secrets a smart move for Brad? At this point – I’ll say, I was genuinely impressed with how Brad was playing this game!   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Beware Advantage  After each of the three castaways, Tiffany, Sydney, and Brad, found their (not so hidden) “Beware Advantage,” they all stepped onto a boat and separately arrived at another island late into the night. This was a risk itself because each member had to make this trip both fast and efficiently so they wouldn’t get caught by the rest of the tribe. Brad even went to the lengths of putting shoes on a few logs to look like he was still sleeping! READ MORE:  ‘Survivor 41’ Episode 1 Recap: Two Eliminations, One Summit The three instantly had an important decision to make. Like the  Survivor  Summits, they each had a choice to risk their next vote in order to gain a “steal a vote advantage.” The decision was between choosing either a tarp for the entire tribe or a “steal a vote advantage.” Before making their decision, the three got the chance to discuss with one another. Of course, all three of them wanted to gain a “steal a vote.” The thing is, if all three of them selected it, they’d all lose their vote. If all three chose a tarp, they’d all get a tarp. But, if just one person selects a tarp – then whoever chose the “steal a vote” option would receive that advantage. Make sense? ..Eh, I know, it’s sorta hard to keep up with these advantages. Okay, so here’s how it went down. As the three were chatting about what to do, Sydney began to feel weird about Tiffany’s intense demeanor. She didn’t trust her, and she chose “tarp” so she wouldn’t lose her vote. But, because Tiffany picked up on this “uneasy” vibe between her and Sydney, Tiffany got nervous as well, and also chose the tarp. Since Brad already lost his vote from finding his in-active Hidden Immunity Idol – he, of course, decided the “steal a vote option.” This means both Tiffany and Sydney didn’t receive a tarp, but Brad did get his “steal a vote” advantage! Brad now has gained three advantages just from this episode alone.   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Immunity Challenge And Reward On top of immunity this week, the tribes competed for a reward as well: a big plate of fruit. And by the way these castaways were salivating; you’d think they were looking at a slab of ribs… seemed like a much-needed reward to win!! But first, just like the hilarious outburst in last week’s episode, both Xander and Brad snuck in their secret phrases to sign they found their third of the Immunity Idol:   This keeps getting better and better! 😂👏🏽🦋🥦  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/HzZz0zNGZH   — SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 7, 2021 … even though Brad butchered his phrase, Xander understood the sign. Unfortunately, the two need just one more person from the Luvu tribe to find theirs to activate their idols. Until then, the two cannot vote at the next Tribal.   Photo Courtesy of CBS   During the challenge, the tribes were pretty even. One at a time, the castaways would have to swim across to a platform in the ocean, make their way across a rope balance beam, and swim to shore. After all of the castaways were on the beach, they’d have to dig up a big bag that carried multiple sandbags and bring it even further into the beach. And finally, to win the challenge, the tribes needed to toss their small sandbags onto a set of posts. First two tribes to finish, win both immunity and reward! As mentioned, it was a tight race – but it was JD who dropped the ball (or should I say sandbag) for the Ua tribe and lost. Both the Luvu and Yase tribes won immunity this week!   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Tribal Council Both Brad and JD are on the chopping block at this point. Shan, who’s been playing strategy this entire game so far, is the deciding vote once again. Brad and Genie are showing Shan every reason for her to trust them  (let’s not forget Brad showing her all his secret gadgets to advance their game!)  But, the thing is, Brad cannot vote and cannot use his “steal a vote” because so. He’s really putting his trust in Shan and Genie as he wants to get JD out next. There’s also Ricard, but he doesn’t trust Genie since she put his name down at the first Tribal Council. Because of this, Ricard is mostly aligning himself with Shan as well. And then, there’s JD – who thinks he has a strong alliance with Shan and Ricard… that is until he gets caught lying. Yep. Remember when JD received an extra vote from the  Survivor  Summit? Well, he’s been lying to his alliance – keeping the extra vote advantage info from Shan. Just before Tribal Council, Shan noticed the advantage paper in his pants and confronted him right away. So, JD says he must “come clean” to her and Ricard…   There’s a difference! 😬  #Survivor   pic.twitter.com/UIEZL0vbIw   — SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs)  October 7, 2021 This pissed off Shan. She knows she now can’t trust JD at all. So, to gain a little trust back in her eyes, she asks JD if she can hold onto his extra vote as his “punishment.” He gives it to her – no questions asked. But in the end, I was disappointed. Brad was completely blindsided! Shan ultimately decided he just had too much power in his pockets, and he was the next to get voted out.   Photo Courtesy of CBS   Ahhh – I was so bummed to see Brad go! He was playing so well in this episode. It just shows that you can’t trust anyone in this game. Brad simply put his fate into the wrong hands and got ahead of himself… What’d you think of this week’s vote?

The run game has been mostly an afterthought. But when Brady returned to New England, Tampa Bay focused more on the run. The rainy weather may have had something to do with it. But the Bucs’ Leonard Fournette had his best game of the season, picking up 92 yards for a solid 4.6 yards per carry. He could be in line for another big game in Week 5 against a Miami Dolphins run defense that gives up 136.8 yards on the ground per game.

(WJZ) —  Hate it or love it, social media has become a major part of many of our lives. But our reliance on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok can also be a double-edged sword.   On one hand, social media platforms are a great way for people to connect with friends and acquaintances. On the other hand, it can and foster feelings of jealousy and animosity among people who would normally get along.   As a communications expert recently explained to WJZ, young people are especially vulnerable to the effects of social media — for better or worse.   “It plays a role nobody could have possibly imagined 10 years ago,” said Dr. Elliot King, professor of communications at Loyola University Maryland.   Dr. King said recent testimony provided to Congress by a former Facebook employee confirms what social science research has been for some time: that social media can be particularly harmful to children.   “There’s no training that we’re being manipulated by social media platforms that’s known,” King said. “It would be good if we taught kids or adults how they’re being manipulated, so when they’re being manipulated, they can say, ‘Oh, you’re manipulating me.'”   Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee turned whistleblower,  compared Facebook to cigarettes , according to CBS News.   “Facebook understands that if they want to continue to grow, they have to find new users,” Haugen testified. “They have to make sure that that next generation is just as engaged on Instagram as the current one, and the way they’ll do that is by making sure that children establish habits before they have good self-regulation.”   As Dr. King pointed out, it’s important to keep in mind that the goal of social media is to keep people engaged. Platforms want users to keep scrolling because ultimately they’re selling your attention to advertisers.   Another thing users should consider, King said, is that consuming images and video of other people’s seemingly perfect lives can affect young people’s self-esteem and body image.   That’s why some parents keep tabs on how their children use social media, or how much time if spent browsing these platforms.   Lisa Kelemen said she’s always monitoring her teenagers’ activity on social media.   “It just seems like social anxiety is on the rise, and it seems like kids are really finding more comfort behind a screen,” Kelemen said. “And so that’s just a real concern for me.”   Peter Adams is a grandparent who believes communication is key when it comes to educating children about social media. That’s been his approach with his 12-year-old grandson.   “If you’re constantly looking at TikTok, Instagram, nothing wrong with Facebook, but you have to know when to cut it on and when to cut it off,” Adams said. “And I think that’s what a lot of our young people don’t realize.”                                           ", "sentiment": 0.09864393939393937, "subjectivity": 0.4316464646464645, "wordcount": 468}

Also, when Sam thinks she’s crazy because she continues to see the ghosts of Woodstone Manor, she tries to ignore them, making them even more determined to get her to acknowledge they’re real.   The ghosts are a close-knit, eclectic group that includes a saucy Prohibition-era lounge singer; a pompous 1700s militiaman; a ‘60s hippie fond of hallucinogens; an overly upbeat ‘80s scout troop leader; a cod-obsessed Viking explorer from 1009; a slick ‘90s finance bro; a sarcastic and witty native from the 1500s; and a society woman and wife of an 1800s robber baron who is Samantha’s ancestor, to name a few. If the spirits were anxious about the commotion a renovation and B&B will create in their home, it’s nothing compared to when they realize Samantha is the first live person who can see and hear them.

Police said a gun was recovered from the car. The  46-year-old was extradited to Maryland this week , where he faces first-degree murder charges in the deaths of the Robinettes and Reynolds.

In another shooting early Thursday morning, police said a 29-year-old was shot in the head inside a home in the 1700 block of Milton Avenue. A 26-year-old woman was also shot in the chest and died, according to the department. A few hours before that, police say a 16-year-old boy was shot and killed on North Edgewood Street in West Baltimore. “It’s a shame that the younger generation, they don’t even have a chance to live their lives,” said John Prince who lives in the area.

The network spanned D.C., Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey. According to court documents, Chester A. Moody, Jr., 47, of Glenn Dale, Maryland; Emmanuel A. Powe, Sr., 46, of Frederick, Maryland; and Odell S. Anderson, Sr., 52, of D.C. participated in almost every aspect of dog fighting from at least 2013 to 2018. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The three men reportedly participated in full-blown dog fighting shows that were planned months in advance. In one 2016 fight in Virginia, officials said two dogs, owned and sponsored by the defendants, died after losing fights. Officials said both Anderson and Moody trained and fought dogs with “Champion” or “Grand Champion” status, meaning they had won multiple consecutive fights. The trio reportedly owned dog fighting equipment like dog treadmills, veterinary kits, breeding stands and weighted collars. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “The violent and cruel act of dog fighting is a heinous form of animal abuse,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh for the Eastern District of Virginia. “These defendants served as leaders, breeders and trainers for a multi-year dog fighting operation and brazenly promoted this barbaric form of ‘entertainment’ for illegal personal gain. We must treat these animals — who are among society’s most vulnerable victims — with dignity and respect.” Moody pleaded guilty in April to one felony count of conspiracy to engage in dog fighting activities over several years. He will serve a year and a day in prison followed by a year of supervised release. Powe pleaded guilty in May to one felony count of conspiracy to engage in dog fighting activities over several years. He’ll serve 18 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Anderson pleaded guilty on June 1 to the same felony count of conspiracy to engage in dog fighting activities and also pleaded guilty to one count of causing a child under the age of 16 to attend an illegal animal fight venture.

(WJZ) —  Anne Arundel County Superintendent of Schools Dr. George Arlotto is seeking a $7.4 million budget increase to boost pay for school bus drivers and attendants. In a proposal announced Thursday, Dr. Arlotto said he’s asking the Board of Education for enough money to make sure every bus driver and attendant employed by the school district and its contractors receives a pay raise equal to $5 an hour. The proposal is part of an effort aimed at addressing a bus driver shortage, which has had a significant impact on bus routes this year. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Besides the budget increase, the superintendent also recommends spending $150,000 in federal funding to provide $2,000 signing bonuses to new hires, as well as $2 million that would go toward retention bonuses for existing drivers and attendants. The bonuses, Dr Arlotto said, would be financed through the county’s American Rescue Plan funds. Earlier this week drivers with the Annapolis Bus Company  went on strike , demanding higher compensation to match a tougher workload brought on by the shortage. About 80 Anne Arundel County school bus routes were canceled Tuesday. Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman said Tuesday the school system must make a plan. “We must get a plan together because it is that plan that’s going to give our current drivers the faith that things will get better,” Pittman  said Tuesday . “We won’t solve the shortage of drivers problem in this county until we address the fact that these jobs don’t pay a livable wage.” In his statement Thursday, the superintendent challenged Pittman’s remarks. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “Mr. Pittman’s statement yesterday that our school system has not been working on a plan to address this issue could not have been more incorrect,” Dr. Arlotto said. “We have actively been working on a plan, respecting that our bus services are provided by independent vendors and their employees. The County Executive and his administration have, in fact, been part of those ongoing conversations. What we have come up with at this point will not solve the problem overnight, but it will hasten the day when all of our bus routes are covered for all of our students.” “We now have a proposal that gives hope to our drivers and an incentive for others to join their ranks,” Pittman said in response to the announcement Thursday. “I look forward to working with Dr. Arlotto and the Board of Education on a funding plan and swift implementation.”         MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government                                   ", "sentiment": 0.14795783926218709, "subjectivity": 0.4573232323232323, "wordcount": 449}

Dr. Esther Liu, Chair of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center, said, “the risk of the illness itself far exceeds the risk of the vaccine.” She said she is disheartened to see young COVID patients, struggling as they fight the virus. She said parents should talk to their health care provider; “what we thankfully have not seen are any major complications of the vaccine, but it’s a risk benefit-I never promise my families anything is 100% effective or 100% safe.” Some parents and grandparents said they want the children in their life vaccinated, for their own safety and the safety of their family.

One woman told WJZ, “I think it’s dangerous for the older kids, we’ve seen myocarditis, so I think it’s a risk and I don’t think it should be allowed.” Vaccines have been available for children 12 and up since May, but only 50% of 16 and 17 year-olds are vaccinated. 43% of kids ages 12-15 have gotten the shots. As children attend school with their peers, transmission in the classroom is a top concern for health officials who are now seeing about 25% of weekly COVID cases are children. Dr. Liu said there has been a 25% increase in weekly pediatric COVID cases since early on in the pandemic when the younger age group was less susceptible to the disease. Now that kids are back in school, interacting with their peers, she said it is crucial they be protected. “The impact of this will be really able to protect our school-aged kids,” Dr. Liu said.

They’ve won three in a row, most recently putting up 36 points on the undefeated Carolina Panthers, who boasted one of the NFL’s top defenses. They’re followed by the Washington Football Team, who are off to a disappointing start. What was supposed to be one of the NFL’s top defenses is giving up yards and points in bunches. If not for a fair bit of luck, WFT could easily be winless. That would still put them only a game behind the 1-3 New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. The Giants seem to be emerging from the growing pains they’ve suffered with Daniel Jones in recent years. The Eagles, however, are still adapting to life in the Jalen Hurts era. While their young dual-threat quarterback provides plenty of excitement, they’ve still lost three straight. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts CBS DFW sports anchor Bill Jones looks at the three NFC East matchups in Week 5. All times listed are Eastern. Stream your local NFL On CBS game live on Paramount+. Philadelphia Eagles @ Carolina Panthers, Sunday, October 10 @ 1:00 p.m. The Eagles defense has given up over 40 points in recent weeks. The Cowboys put up 41 two weeks ago, and the Chiefs scored 42 last week. Dak Prescott threw for three touchdowns, and Patrick Mahomes had five of his own in those Eagles losses. While big losses to two of the NFL’s most high-powered offenses isn’t necessarily the best measure of a defense, it does suggest they are prone to allowing points. The Carolina Panthers could welcome back Christian McCaffrey from a strained hamstring. That would be a boost to the unit. According to Jones, “Carolina is doing just enough offensively, even without Christian McCaffrey at running back. Sam Darnold has found a new home in Carolina. He’s taking care of the football when he’s not going up against Trevon Diggs and the Cowboys, of course.” Darnold has been productive, when his offensive line gives him time. He went 26-39 for 301 yards and two TDs against the Cowboys and 23-34 for 304 yards against the Texans. But their defense has been stifling, at least up until their first loss. “The Panthers came into last week’s game against the Cowboys with the number-one-ranked defense in the league, number one against the run, number one against the pass,” Jones notes. “But we saw what the Cowboys did against them, put up 36 points on Carolina in the first three quarters of that game.” Philadelphia has been adapting to life under second-year quarterback Jalen Hurts. The Eagles have lost three straight after their Week 1 win over the Atlanta Falcons. Hurts’ numbers have been solid, both as a runner and a passer — 56.5 and 291.8 yards respectively — but his production hasn’t led to wins. According to Jones, “Philadelphia doesn’t have the same kind of offense that the Cowboys have, and the focus is on Jalen Hurts, as he tries to evolve into an NFL-caliber quarterback. He’s passed for a lot of yards, but a lot of that has been late in games. Like a couple of weeks ago against the Cowboys they got over 300 yards because they were so far behind.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University New Orleans Saints @ Washington Football Team, Sunday, October 10 @ 1:00 p.m. Washington is coming off a late win over the Falcons, while the Saints lost a tough one to the Giants in overtime. Both teams sit at 2-2, in a season that’s already had its share of ups and downs. Washington lost starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick in Week 1, and has been led by the exciting though inexperienced Taylor Heinicke. The Saints had to deal with being uprooted from New Orleans. “The Saints, it’s amazing, they started the year with a 38-3 win in Jacksonville against the Green Bay Packers,” Jones noted. “It was very disappointing for them, last week, losing their first game at home in New Orleans after having to transplant. Here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, they were working out at TCU for nearly a full month. So it was very disappointing for them to lose that game.” The Saints have also had their issues on offense of late. Jameis Winston has only topped 200 yards passing in one game this season. That’s a far cry from the standard Drew Brees set in his years with the team. According to Jones, “it’s a struggle offensively, even though Sean Payton is very creative as an offensive play caller, with Jameis Winston at quarterback. And they uses Taysom Hill some as well.” The Washington defense was supposed to be team strength coming into the season. But they’re allowing 417.5 yards and 30.5 points per game so far, fourth and third worst in the NFL respectively. That’s with basically the same lineup that made them one of the league’s top-ranked units last season. What defense will show up against the Saints? “I think Washington’s defense is just too tough,” Jones said. “I think Washington has gotten off to a disappointing start, because a lot of people pick them to win the division. But with a defense that’s pretty solid, that’ll keep you in games.” New York Giants @ Dallas Cowboys, Sunday, October 10 @ 4:25 p.m. While the Giants are 1-3 and the Cowboys are 3-1, records often don’t matter much in division matchups. Daniel Brown is coming off a career performance against the Saints, piling up 402 yards and two TDs on 28-40 passing. “Daniel Jones is playing the best football that he’s played in his three-year NFL career. He’s now in his third year. He’s the NFC Offensive Player of the Week from last week, having thrown for over 400 yards against the Saints last week.” And Jones will lead a Giants team into Dallas that easily could be 3-1. “I wouldn’t sleep on the Giants,” warned Jones. “When you look at what the Giants have done so far, their strength of schedule has not been that great. But a couple of weeks ago, Thursday night game against Washington, they had the game won. Dexter Lawrence jumps offsides on the field goal attempt by Washington that was no good, gave them a second chance. Washington kicks the field goal to win, 30-29. Then the next week against Atlanta, they lose on a last-second field goal, 17-14. They come back and win last week. They could easily be 2-2, if Dexter Lawrence doesn’t jump offsides in that Washington game. And they could also be 3-1 if they just pull out that tight game against Atlanta a couple weeks ago.” The Cowboys could easily be 4-0, if not for the last-minute heroics of Tom Brady in Week 1. Their offense is averaging 420.8 yards and 31.5 points, both top five in the league. And Dak Prescott has been impressive in his return under center. According to Jones, “as long as the Cowboys don’t pay attention to the hype and keep a level head, and so forth and continue to run the football and have a balanced offense, like they’ve had in the last couple of weeks, they should be able to win this game.” MORE NEWS:  'It's Monday Night Football': Ravens Fans Gearing Up For Tonight's Game Against The Indianapolis Colts The Dallas defense has been a little shaky so far this season, giving up 396.3 yards per game.

The Delta variant is driving up case numbers among the unvaccinated. President Biden is instituting stronger efforts to encourage vaccines, as case numbers are felt across certain segments of the economy. Some people have yet to experience any real improvement. Unemployment still exceeds pre-pandemic levels, even with jobs widely available in certain sectors. The federal unemployment bonus ended over a month ago. Millions of people remain short of food and behind on bills, and a fourth stimulus check could help. A few places, including California, have recognized that need for additional help and provided additional payments. But will the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) be sending out another stimulus check in 2021? That question hasn’t been answered definitively. But plenty of clues point where things are heading. Economic Recovery For Some READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Relief payments were intended to ease COVID’s economic impact and support the economy in the process. The third round of relief payments started back in March, courtesy of the American Rescue Plan (ARP). Over the following months, about  169 million people  received up to $1,400 each. That accounted for nearly all of the $422 billion set aside. The ARP checks closely followed the $600 payments from January, which came nine months after the $1,200 payments from the pandemic’s early days. They seem to have worked, but have also helped many who didn’t actually need the money. In the second quarter of 2021, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of  6.7 percent , according to the most recent estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. ( Supply shortages  may have prevented even faster growth.) That continues the torrid pace from the first quarter, which saw 6.4 percent growth. The  Conference Board  forecasts continued though slower growth through the rest of the year. The country’s  gross domestic product  (GDP), an estimate of economic activity across the U.S., has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. By that general measure, the economy has fully recovered. Broad segments of the workforce have endured little economic hardship during the pandemic. Many jobs performed at a desk in an office are just as easily performed at a desk in someone’s home. And with fewer places to spend money during much of the pandemic, plus three stimulus checks, many Americans saved more than they might have otherwise. The personal saving rate ballooned to 33.7 percent in April of 2020 and has remained well above pre-pandemic levels ever since. In August of 2021, it sat at  9.4 percent , still above the 8.3 percent from February of 2020, the month before the pandemic started. On  Face the Nation  back in June, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan  estimated  that its customers had not spent 65-70 percent of their last two stimulus checks. That extra savings combined with pent-up demand has likely helped drive the broader economy during the rebound. The  housing market  has also surged, thanks to low interest rates and people stuck at home realizing the limitations of their living space. The National Association of Realtors recently reported that the national median sales price for an existing home hit $356,700 in August, up 14.9 percent from August of 2020. Much of that rise was helped along by houses priced above the median. Housing inventory decreased over July, and was down 13.4 percent year over year. And of the homes that sold in August, 87 percent were for sale for less than a month. The stock market continues to perform well too. Despite a bumpy week, Dow Jones remains far above where it was at this time last year. It has regularly approached record territory. The market opened Friday morning at 34,757 as compared to 28,425 at this time a year ago. Concerns about the Delta variant and lagging vaccination rates in parts of the world still linger. COVID case numbers continue to rise, and mask guidelines have become more stringent in some parts of the country, thanks to the Delta variant. But the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) full approval of the Pfizer vaccine, along with the approval of booster shots for those at risk or over 65 yeas old, has been good news for the market. Individual investors who saved their stimulus cash remain invested. Bigger investors continue to bet on a strong economic recovery in the months ahead. While certain experts foresee some of the strongest economic growth in decades, many are also a little concerned about higher inflation. Recent projections indicate that prices will rise about  5.3 percent  in 2021. That’s compared to the 2.3 percent rate in 2019 and 1.7 percent rate in 2020. The latest data shows prices rising  5.3 percent  over the last 12 months. Should that rate persist for the rest of the year, it would be the highest in three decades. That possibility has become less likely of late. Prices moved up 0.3 percent in August, a slowdown from previous months. Core consumer prices — excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile — rose only 0.1 percent. Nevertheless, rising prices continue for many products that require semiconductors, including new cars, computers, and TVs. Price hikes and product shortages stem, in part, from the economy opening up all at once. Prices depressed by the pandemic have had to normalize. But companies couldn’t keep pace with a year’s worth of pent-up consumer demand. They also have had to revive and retool their supply chains in the midst of drastic changes in consumer demand patterns. And this has all happened as shipping issues and other constraints continue to slow production and delivery. COVID has altered how and what people consume. The way these changes continue to play out isn’t necessarily predictable. Companies, however, have had to guess where demand for their product will be when all the dust settles. Predicting the future is hard enough in a normal economy. It became much harder in an economy trying to move past a pandemic then forced to deal with a resurgence. Price changes and shortages across a whole range of products will likely continue to plague consumers in the short-term. But economists think they should improve with time. Consumer spending  is picking up again, with the rate up 0.8 percent in August, as compared to a 0.1 percent drop in July. Demand for travel and leisure continued to ease with the rise of the Delta variant. Spending on food and household supplies rebounded. New car purchases continue to be a drag, with semiconductor shortages still creating production and supply issues. Overall, goods spending remains above pre-pandemic levels, but could also be showing the effects  Delta variant  concerns. No Economic Recovery For Others The pandemic has further highlighted the growing imbalance across the broader economy. While many households have financially flourished during COVID, many others have fallen behind where they were in early 2020. Much of the gap depends on whether wage earners could work remotely during the shutdown or had public-facing jobs that required them to be on-site. Financial insecurity is still widespread, and the loss of a job and the loss of hours were some of the main reasons over the course of the pandemic. Nine percent of American adults (approximately 20 million people) reported a  shortage of food  in their household over the previous week, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of U.S. Census survey data from late September. Approximately 14 percent of renters (10.3 million people) have fallen behind on their rent, including 21 percent of renters with children in their household. The federal  eviction moratorium , which ended October 3, didn’t forgive rent that was owed, it pushed the debt into the future. And  evictions continued  in some parts of the country regardless. Meanwhile, only a fraction of the $46 billion Congress allocated for rental assistance has actually made it to tenants and landlords. As of late September, over a quarter of American adults (63 million people) reported some difficulty keeping up with expenses in the prior week. Employment also remains below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate fell to  4.8 percent  in September, with some workers finding jobs or leaving the workforce. Job growth continues to fall short of expectations. Forecasters expected roughly 490,000 new jobs in September, but employers only added about 194,000. (August saw about 366,000 new jobs.) Many fear the rise of the Delta variant is hindering growth. Low-wage jobs made up the bulk of those lost during the pandemic, and while plenty of openings have returned, many remain unfilled. Approximately  326,000 people  initially applied for unemployment insurance in the week ending October 2. (A typical pre-pandemic week saw about 250,000 new unemployment applications.) As of the week ending September 18, close to 4.2 million workers were receiving some form of unemployment aid. (The approximately 4.9 million people previously collecting PUA  lost benefits  on September 6, when the program ended.) Many jobless Americans have not received unemployment insurance and other government benefits, because of long waits, perceived ineligibility and other issues. Job growth still faces some headwinds, aside from the Delta variant. Some have argued that overly generous benefits made unemployment more attractive than working. But other considerations factor into one’s ability to work too. Remote schooling created childcare issues for many parents that summer break didn’t change. The resumption of in-person learning, if it lasts, could free up some parents to return to work. The full vaccination rate is  56.2 percent  for the country. But state percentages range from 69.8 percent in Vermont to 40.6 percent in West Virginia. Many counties across the country have vaccination rates lower than that. The threat of COVID, particularly the now-dominant Delta variant, is still real in places. Many people are uncomfortable working in public around strangers. A gap between labor force skills and job requirements can make hiring more difficult, not to mention the rising standards of what workers will accept in a job. And then there’s the general friction that inevitably arises when an entire economy slams its foot on the gas. As before the pandemic, many who are willing to work cannot find jobs with the wages and benefits they need to survive. According to  Marie Newman , a U.S. Representative from Illinois, “there is not a shortage of Americans looking for work, there is a shortage of Americans willing to work for starvation wages with no benefits, no health care, and no protections during a pandemic.” About half of all states tried to force the issue and push people back into the job market. These states, most led by Republicans, discontinued the $300  federal unemployment benefit bonus  for their citizens ahead of the official Labor Day end date, or at least attempted to. Analysis from a payroll services company called  Gusto  showed that cutting off federal benefits didn’t lead to  more hiring . The federal unemployment bonus and the previous round of stimulus checks helped Americans still awaiting their recovery to pay bills and put food on the table. The advance Child Tax Credit provides some additional support to families. But this money only goes so far. And some politicians feel that the payments haven’t been enough. Support For A Fourth Stimulus Check A group of Democratic Senators, including Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, sent a  letter to President Joe Biden  at the end of March requesting “recurring direct payments and automatic unemployment insurance extensions tied to economic conditions.” As the Senators reasoned in their letter, “this crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. Families should not be at the mercy of constantly-shifting legislative timelines and ad hoc solutions.” An earlier letter to  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris  from 53 Representatives, led by  Ilhan Omar  of Minnesota, carved out a similar position. “Recurring direct payments until the economy recovers will help ensure that people can meet their basic needs, provide racially equitable solutions, and shorten the length of the recession.” Additional co-signers included New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib, two other notable names among House Progressives. The letter didn’t place a number on the requested stimulus payments. But a tweet soon after put it at $2,000 per month for the length of the pandemic.   $2,000 monthly payments until the pandemic is over.  https://t.co/6tuia6prFJ   — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN)  January 28, 2021 A  May 17 letter  from members of the House Ways and Means Committee renewed the push for additional stimulus. “The ARP’s $1,400 checks alone will keep 11 million people out of poverty this year, with UI (unemployment insurance) expansion and other provisions in the bill accounting for the another five million. A fourth and fifth check could keep an additional 12 million out of poverty. Combined with the effects of the ARP, direct payments could reduce the number in poverty in 2021 from 44 million to 16 million.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn There’s also been talk about  automatic payments  that could be sent when specific economic metrics reach certain thresholds (for example, if unemployment rises to 6 percent). These triggers would make stimulus checks a reactive force in countering economic dips, sparing struggling Americans from Congressional delays. A majority of Americans also favor recurring relief payments. According to a January poll from  Data For Progress , nearly two-thirds of all voters support $2,000 monthly payments to all Americans for the length of the pandemic. Supporters include a majority of Independents and Republicans. A struggling restaurant owner’s  online petition  calling for $2,000 monthly payments for every American adult has surpassed 2.9 million signatures. The  Urban Institute  estimated that another stimulus payment could reduce poverty by at least 6.4 percent in 2021. Many economists are also onboard. A 2020  open letter  from experts in the field argued “direct cash payments are an essential tool that will boost economic security, drive consumer spending, hasten the recovery, and promote certainty at all levels of government and the economy – for as long as necessary.” California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a  new budget  into law in July, which includes a stimulus check for about two-thirds of the state’s residents. The $100 billion California Comeback Plan, as part of their  $262.2 billion budget , is paying $600 to residents earning between $30,000 and $75,000 per year. Residents in that income range who have kids are receiving $1,100. Those checks  started going out  the last Friday in August The state’s previous stimulus went to those with an annual income under $30,000. Other states have also authorized payments.  Maryland handed out  $300 or $500 checks to those who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on their tax returns.  Florida gave  $1,000 bonuses to teachers, which started showing up in August. Denton and Irving school districts in  north Texas  were scheduled to give retention bonuses of $500 and $2,000 respectively at the start of the school year. The Biden administration is also planning to give a one-time  $600 payment  to farm workers and meatpacking workers. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the plan in early September. The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated up to $700 million for the limited-scope stimulus check. The aid will be handed out through state agencies and include a pilot program giving extra money to grocery store workers. The Biden administration, which authored the third round of stimulus checks, isn’t against a fourth round. But the president recognizes their high price tag. He also has other priorities, specifically infrastructure and help for families. Neither the American Jobs Plan nor the American Families Plan, the administration’s original infrastructure and human infrastructure proposals, included another relief payment. Other plans currently bouncing around Congress don’t either. A Fourth Stimulus Check Is Unlikely All of the tacit and explicit support for stimulus checks keeps the possibility alive. The support doesn’t make a fourth payment likely, however. And there are many reasons why. Vaccinations are progressing steadily, albeit not as quickly as in the spring. Adults and those at least 12 years old are eligible to be inoculated in all 50 states. (Trials for children under 12 continue with approval expected soon.) Three different options are available to the public, with the Pfizer vaccine fully approved by the FDA. Booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine have also been approved and rolled out for those at risk or over 65. Actually putting needles in arms is taking time, even with supply readily available. Americans have received over 399 million doses, with 65.1 percent of the population having received at least one dose and 56.2 percent completely vaccinated. Vaccination numbers continue to increase at a rate of just under a million doses per day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its guidance and recommends that vaccinated people in areas with higher COVID transmission revert to wearing  masks indoors  again. With vaccinations rising, the nation’s economy continues to recover. Looser restrictions have helped businesses, and jobs are available in many sectors. Many industries are even complaining of worker shortages, which are leading to wage increases. The number of new unemployment claims remains lower than it has been for much of the pandemic. In September,  consumer confidence  dropped again due to ongoing concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices.  Consumer sentiment  ticked up a bit last month. Confidence, however, remains higher than it’s been for much of the pandemic. Consumer spending drives two-thirds of the country’s economy. And excess pandemic savings, along with three stimulus checks, has boosted people’s spending power. That spending power has increased even more since monthly Child Tax Credit payments started on July 15. The most recent payment went out September 15. An improved financial position generally also raises optimism for the future. The ongoing vaccinations, which have allowed the economy to reopen to some degree, certainly help. All that additional spending, along with the release of pent-up demand, has led to the availability of more jobs as companies try to hire to address consumer needs. With the economy growing, a fourth round of stimulus checks seems less urgent. Aside from the generally improving economy, the political machinations of Washington make a fourth stimulus check a longshot. The American Rescue Plan, which included the third stimulus check, passed along party lines. Republicans were not interested in spending anywhere close to $1.9 trillion, though some did support the third relief payment. They termed the package a “blue state bailout,” claiming it went well beyond the scope of COVID and would increase the deficit, leading to inflation. The Democrats used a process called  reconciliation  to pass the bill in the Senate without Republican support. That allows budget-related matters to proceed with a simple majority rather than the filibuster-proof 60 votes. Generally only one reconciliation bill can pass per fiscal year. But a subsequent ruling by the  Senate parliamentarian , who interprets the legislative body’s rules, opened up a path for additional spending legislation. Without reconciliation, any bill would need at least 10 Republican votes, along with every Democratic vote. But the Biden administration has other priorities. One of its biggest is addressing infrastructure. The proposed  American Jobs Plan , which aimed to rebuild roads, repair bridges, do away with lead pipes, extend broadband, modernize the country’s electric grid and much more, carried a price tag of $2.3 trillion. Biden and a group of Senators from both parties agreed upon a scaled-back infrastructure plan costing about $1 trillion. The resulting bipartisan bill, now called the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , passed the Senate in early August. Neither the original version nor the bipartisan bill that moved forward includes a fourth stimulus check. One could, in theory, be added when the House takes up the bill. That seems unlikely given the price tag. The American Families Plan, focused on childcare, education and more, would have cost another $1.8 trillion in its initial form. The Democrats are now pushing forward a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint that focuses on their various “human infrastructure” initiatives, such as Medicare expansion, child care, and climate change. A fourth stimulus check is not included, though one could theoretically still be added as well. The Democrats’ extended plan is a more likely home for a fourth stimulus check than a traditional infrastructure plan. Funding these plans will almost certainly involve tax increases on corporations and wealthy individuals, which Republicans would oppose. Plenty more negotiating seems inevitable before any bill gets passed into law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised not to take up the infrastructure bill until the Senate also passes the human infrastructure bill. Democrats are already laying the groundwork to use reconciliation again to push through this legislation. Joe Manchin  of West Virginia, among the most centrist Democratic Senators, has warned against overusing reconciliation. He is also apparently unwilling to do away with the filibuster, which would lower the number of votes needed to pass legislation to 51. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema doesn’t want to abandon the filibuster either. Manchin also wants to see the human infrastructure bill shrink. With bipartisanship still hard to come by, the Biden administration is in a tough spot. They’re unlikely to add a fourth stimulus check to any plan, driving up the price tag by hundreds of billions of dollars. They’re also unlikely to use reconciliation to pass another stimulus check on its own. What Other Aid Is Out There? While a fourth stimulus check is improbable, more direct payments to Americans have already been signed into law. Up until Labor Day, the jobless received extended unemployment benefits. The American Rescue Plan also includes an advance Child Tax Credit. Under the revised Child Tax Credit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is paying out $3,600 per year for each child up to five years old and $3,000 per year for each child ages six through 17. Monthly payments of up to $300 per child started July 15 and will continue through December of 2021. The remainder is to be issued when the recipient files their 2021 taxes. The benefit does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. In other words, qualifying families will receive the full amount, regardless of how much — or little — they owe in taxes. Payments start to phase out beyond a $75,000 annual income for individuals and beyond $150,000 for married couples. The more generous credit will apply only for 2021, though Biden has stated his interest in extending it through 2025. The ARP added $21.6 billion to the  Emergency Rental Assistance Program , which is being distributed to state and local governments, who then assist households. Most of the $46 billion total has yet to reach tenants and landlords. The infrastructure and human infrastructure plans also have the potential to create many jobs across a wide swath of the economy. How the proposed initiatives are ultimately distributed across the bipartisan bill or the broader Democratic plan remains to be seen. The American Families Plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave that could have reached as high as $4,000 per month, depending on a worker’s income. It also boosted the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and placed a ceiling on the cost of childcare for many families. The plan set aside $200 billion for universal preschool. In addition to helping working parents pay for childcare, the plan sought to allow more parents to return to the workforce. Look for similar programs and more when the specifics of the human infrastructure plan are worked out. Additional money in people’s pockets from any bill or proposed plan is still hypothetical, of course. Nothing has found its way through Congress yet. And it could be months until it does.

(AP) —  By the end of last week, it was clear that Baltimore’s streak of 100-yard rushing games mattered to coach John Harbaugh. His players are also aware of it, although some of them have downplayed it to some degree. The question now is whether the Indianapolis Colts can do anything to stop it. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “I just really will focus on our guys and execution with the plan,” Colts defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus said. “I won’t talk much about those other outside forces, to use those as motivation. I just think our guys are really focused on us and focused on the plan that we have going forward for this week.” The Ravens host the Colts on Monday night, and Eberflus’ diplomatic comment about Baltimore’s streak suggests it might not be as much of  a flashpoint  as it was last week. At the end of Baltimore’s win over Denver, the Ravens had quarterback Lamar Jackson run for a few more yards instead of taking a knee, pushing the team’s rushing total into triple digits for a 43rd consecutive game. That tied an NFL record — and left Broncos coach Vic Fangio furious. Harbaugh made no apologies for caring about the record. Ravens offensive lineman Patrick Mekari said the players weren’t that focused on reaching 100 yards — the coaches called a play, and the players’ job is to execute it. Still, the home crowd Monday will likely be quite aware of what another 100-yard rushing game would mean. “Getting a win and doing it with breaking a record, it would be pretty dope,” Jackson said. “Especially because it’s a rivalry record.” The Ravens (3-1) currently share the record with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who had 43 straight 100-yard rushing games from 1974-77. The Colts (1-3) are coming off their first win of the season. For what it’s worth, they held Miami to 35 yards rushing last week, but their first three opponents reached 100. Although Baltimore has managed to keep its streak going, the Ravens’ backfield has been unsettled thanks to season-ending injuries to J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards. Jackson’s passing has picked up — two of the top three regular-season games of his career in terms of yards passing have come in the past two weeks. STEADY PROGRESSION Indianapolis expected Carson Wentz’s strong arm and ability to run to open up its offense. Now the Colts are finally starting to see some results. Despite playing the first four games with at least one offensive line starter out — and playing the past two weeks with two sprained ankles himself — Wentz appears to be rounding into form. He’s completed 63.8% of his throws this season with five TD passes, plus one interception when Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald rerouted tight end Jack Doyle on a shovel pass. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “I think his overall decision-making has been very good,” first-year offensive coordinator Marcus Brady said. “He’s taking care of the ball both in the pocket with the pass rush as well as where he’s throwing the ball.” HOMESTAND The Ravens played three of their first four games on the road, but now they don’t have  another road game  until Nov. 11. The next four games for Baltimore are at home, with an open date included in that stretch. ANOTHER MILESTONE Linebacker Justin Houston, with the Ravens now after two seasons in Indianapolis, is 1 1/2 sacks away from 100 in his career. “Whatever quarterback I get it on, I’m going to ask the quarterback, ‘Can I keep that jersey?’” Houston said. UNDER THE LIGHTS This is the third night game for the Ravens already this season — their only other home game was a Sunday night win over Kansas City. Baltimore is 16-2 in home primetime games under Harbaugh. THE GAMBLER Colts coach Frank Reich uses sophisticated charts to help instruct his fourth-down decisions on game day. But he isn’t afraid to play a hunch — as he did last week at Miami. “We had a third-and-15 and threw an out route to (Michael) Pittman and ended up with fourth-and-less-than-one,” he said. “We had the green light to go for it but for whatever reason, I had a gut instinct to punt. That’s the one they fumbled, and we got it right back.” MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government Indy is 3 for 7 on fourth-down conversions this season.

He brought his Tampa Bay Buccaneers back late on the Patriots, driving 45 yards to set up the game-winning field goal. That elevated the defending Super Bowl champions to 3-1 ahead of their Week 5 matchup with the Miami Dolphins. They’ll host a Dolphins team that’s coming off its third straight loss. Miami, now 1-3, fell to the winless Indianapolis Colts in Week 4, failing to keep up with Carson Wentz, who was playing on two sprained ankles. Tom Brady continues to impress at the age of 44. While his former team limited him to only 22-43 passing for 269 yards and no touchdowns, he moved the ball when it mattered. Topping the Patriots gave him at least one win over  every team  in the league. He also set the record for regular-season  passing yards  in a career, surpassing Drew Brees. Brady leads the NFL in passing yards this season with 1,356 and has tossed 10 TD passes against only two interceptions. READ MORE:  Jackson Leads Ravens Back To 31-25 OT Win Over Colts While the GOAT deserves a lot of the credit for the Bucs’ perch atop the NFC South (in a tie with the Carolina Panthers), he is leading one of the NFL’s most high-powered offenses. Chris Godwin, Mike Evans and Antonio Brown present a formidable receiving trio. Leonard Fournette is dangerous out of the backfield. However,  Rob Gronkowski , the team’s touchdown leader and a favorite target of Brady from their days in New England, missed Week 4 with cracked and broken ribs. He’s expected to miss multiple games. Up until last week, the ground game was a bit of an afterthought in Tampa. But with the rainy weather in Foxborough, the Bucs relied heavily of Leonard Fournette. And he came through with 92 yards on 4.6 yards per carry. “Knowing how you can best attack a team, those are adjustments you have to make,” said NFL On CBS analyst Trent Green. Brady and company should be able to move the ball on a  Dolphins defense  that’s allowing 388.3 yards and 27.3 points per game. Both stats put them in the NFL’s bottom 10. Miami has given up at least 20 consecutive points three weeks in a row. They were able to contain the Colts for the first quarter plus, but gave up more big plays as the game wore on. The Dolphins defense allowed 103 yards on 16 carries to Jonathan Taylor and struggled to stop outside rushing plays. Their pass rush was only able to sack the immobile Carson Wentz twice. Lavonte David and Devin White lead the team in tackles, with 32 and 28 respectively. This isn’t the Dolphins team many were expecting at the season’s outset. “I’m actually surprised after having that first game,” Green said. “It’s a tall order to think they’re going to get turned around this week against the Bucs. It’s the NFL, so strange things can happen. Brian Flores has a background with practicing against Tom Brady all that time he was in New England. But Tom is running quite a different offense than what he was running in New England. So that’s going to be a tall order for the Dolphins to get things turned around.” READ MORE:  Washington Wizards Hold Open Practice At Morgan State University While the Dolphins’ defense is underperforming, their offense remains the real problem.  Tua Tagovailoa  is sidelined with a rib injury. He could return for the team’s Week 6 game with Jacksonville Jaguars, but that won’t help them this week. For now, they’ll continue to sputter along behind Jacoby Brissett. He completed 20 of 30 passes for 199 yards and two touchdowns against the Colts. But they had only  62 net passing yards  after three quarters. The team’s two passing touchdowns on Sunday give it a grand total of three on the season. Brissett faced a lot of pressure, getting sacked twice. “They had a specific set of plays and the way they wanted to run their offense with Tua, I remember from talking to the coaches back in week 1,” said Green. “You look at Tua, and you look at Jacoby Brissett, and they’re quite a bit different, different quarterbacks. So I’m sure that has a lot to do with it.” Brissett isn’t getting much help though. The offensive line has allowed 13 sacks on the season, fourth worst in the NFL. Myles Gaskin, the team’s leading rusher, has just 142 yards on the season. The line may struggle to block a solid Bucs run defense that’s allowing a league-low 47.5 yards per game. That number partially stems from the Brady-led offense forcing opposing offenses lighting up the scoreboard and forcing opposing offenses to rely on the pass. But that doesn’t account for all of it. The Bucs actually held the Patriots to  negative rushing yards  on Sunday, a first for the Tampa defense and only the fourth time this has happened since the AFL-NFL merger. They also sacked Mac Jones four times and hit him 12 more.

And even then, it may depend on how much Miami is willing to stretch the field.

CBS’ Katie Johnston spoke with Kittles to get the inside story on season two and what lies ahead for Marcus. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured KJ-  How excited are you to be back for round two? TK-  I can’t tell you how excited we are to be back—to get the response that we’ve gotten after the first season from the fans, from everybody that’s tuning into the show on Sunday nights—it’s incredible! We’re glad to be back and glad to be back in the city of New York doing it. KJ-  Tell me more about your character. What do you love about him? What does he struggle with this season? TK-  I play a character named Detective Marcus Dante. When we first meet him in season one, he’s on the lookout for this vigilante who seems to be popping up everywhere and solving these cases. Detective Dante is a very strait-laced guy, he doesn’t color outside the lines, he is a by-the-book, numbers sort of guy. Then he finds out this vigilante is a woman named Robyn McCall. He gets to know her a little bit. She challenges him a little bit and, by the end of the season, they’re actually helping each other with cases. When we get to season two, he’s not totally on her side yet. He’s still at a bit of a crossroads, but something happens to him—a tragic incident—and he needs her help because she’s the only person who can help him solve this crime. KJ-  In the season two trailer for  The Equalizer , we see a sneak peak of detective Marcus Dante teaming up with Queen Latifah’s character, Robyn McCall. What can we expect from your character and the unique alliance this season? READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn TK-  I think you can expect to see a lot of sparks fly. I think we’re ratcheting up the tension, the chemistry between McCall and Dante. Everything is bigger and better. The action increases. There’s so much excitement going on in this season, I can’t wait or you to see it. KJ-  On a more personal note, we’re still seemingly trying to tackle COVID. What has it been like shooting this upcoming season? How are the safety protocols on set? TK-  We’ve been following protocols. I think our crew has been incredible when it comes to following protocols. They’re the ones who have to keep the mask on at all times. You know, the actors, we get to take them off when we’re doing scenes. The crew has really been leading that. And everybody’s been doing everything they can to stay safe. KJ-  Anything else we haven’t talked about, but we should know before the season two premiere Sunday? TK-  There’s been a lot of imposition on what’s going to happen between McCall and Dante throughout the course of this season.  Without giving up any spoilers, I can say the tension will be explored. There is the possibility that something may ignite.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased by 0.11% to 3.78%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations dropped by one to 791. Of those hospitalized, 594 remain in acute care and 190 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 541,627 total confirmed cases and 10,333 deaths. There are 3,929,284 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,061,754 doses. Of those, 3,984,466 are first doses with 4,488 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,623,716 second doses, 3,692 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,568 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 311 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 148,004 additional or booster vaccine doses, 8,967 in the last day. The state reported 84.4% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured That’s the last thing he remembers. Kendal Hofstad is a custodian with Alomere and just happened to be in that wing of the hospital picking up garbage. “I opened the door and I thought I saw from the corner of my eye some scrubs lying on the floor. I didn’t think anything of it,” Hofstad said. “I thought I better go over there and check it out and I did, and Dr. Szajner was on the floor, unresponsive.” Hofstad called for help and after 12 long minutes of CPR, Szajner was helicoptered to CentraCare in St. Cloud, where a large clot was found in one of his main arteries. “He was initially showing very serious signs of brain injury and heart injury,” Dr. Daniel James Tiede said. After putting in a stent, Tiede used a fairly new piece of technology called an Impella Pump to stabilize Szajner. It’s thinner than a pencil and takes over the job of pumping blood so the heart can rest. Within a few days, Szajner took a turn for the better.

He’s here because of a fellow doctor, a heart pump, and a heads-up custodian. “I’m real happy for him and I’m glad he’s doing real well,” Hofstad said. “When this happened we became better friends, definitely,” Szajner said. “God is so great and gracious and blessed my family to have me around. I feel like every day is a present. It’s his gift.” Szajner is an anesthesiologist and he’s back at work. He has been an avid rock climber in the past and plans to get back to that activity in the near future.

(WJZ) —  A University of Maryland team just published the entire genome sequence of the state’s favorite crustacean — the blue crab. The researchers explained the best way to understand any organism is to understand its genetic blueprint. They say that they’ve learned the crabs’ functions including which genetic traits make the crabs particularly successful and reproducing or adapting to their environment, particularly in waters warmed by climate change. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The genome sequencing project was done by a team of four scientists over the course of four years at the Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology, (IMET) located in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor The project was lead by University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Professor Sook Chung at the IMET. She said understanding the crabs will help us keep them safe in a changing environment. “Marylanders love crabs, and everybody wants to have big, fat crabs in the fall. Understanding what makes them successful is located in the chromosomes,” said Chung, an expert in crab biology. “Knowing the full genome, we are several steps closer to identifying the genes responsible for growth, reproduction, and susceptibility to disease.” Researchers say these findings can help crab fisheries around the Chesapeake Bay and also with fishery policies. Understanding how likely crabs are to reproduce successfully could aid in fisheries policies in places like Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay, helping to maintain a healthy ecosystem and economy, the center said. The crab selected for sequencing was dubbed “The Chosen One.” Researchers isolated a DNA sample from the crab and sent it off for sequencing. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Genome sequencing isn’t simple or easy. The center said the sequencing needed a special computer running night and day for over six months. Associate Research Professor Tsvetan Bachvaroff was responsible for assembling the genome, the center said. “Imagine you take several volumes of an encyclopedia and you have a hundred copies of each volume. You put them all through a paper shredder and then you have to use that to reconstruct the original volumes of the encyclopedia,” Bachvaroff said. “Once the encyclopedia, or genome, is back in the correct order, you can begin to identify genes and use it like a reference book, looking up genes to answer questions.” IMET Executive Director Russell Hill said the sequencing will “fuel decades of research.” “The genome will be made publicly available so that scientists anywhere can use it, and it will fuel decades of research on the blue crab and other crustaceans,” Hill said.   MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government                                   ", "sentiment": 0.20688153310104532, "subjectivity": 0.4301684088269455, "wordcount": 453}

(WJZ) —  A Baltimore man was convicted Thursday of murder and other charges in connection with a  2019 shooting in Mondawmin that resulted in the death of one man  and injured three others. Donte Orlando Patterson, Jr, was found guilty of second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and use of a firearm in a crime of violence, according to the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office.

The charges stem from a shooting that unfolded shortly after 11 a.m. April 11, 2019, in Baltimore’s Mondawmin neighborhood. Officers investigating a ShotSpotter alert about gunfire in the area learned four people had been shot. One of them, Levar Mullen-El, later died of his injuries. The rest survived. Several 9mm and .40-caliber shell casings were recovered at the scene. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Police later recovered surveillance video, which showed a silver Infiniti sedan park in the area. Four people dressed in black were seen getting out of the vehicle and then returning to the car a short time later. Based on a search of police databases, police tracked down that vehicle and linked it to the April 11, 2019, shooting and a separate shooting that killed two people the night before. Patterson was seated on the hood of the vehicle when it was found about a week later on North Chester Street, prosecutors said. A warranted search of the vehicle found a live .4 caliber round, the same type of ammunition found at the shooting scene, on the vehicle’s floorboard. An analysis of Patterson’s cellphone recovered other evidence that authorities used to connect him to the crime.

(WJZ) —  Police have a suspect in custody after two women were killed in a Friday morning shooting inside a Prince George’s County senior living facility. The deadly shooting happened about 9 a.m. at Gateway Village, a senior living facility on Suffolk Avenue in Capitol Heights, according to the Prince George’s County Police Department. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Within 90 minutes of their arrival, investigators found two shooting victims inside the center and took the shooting suspect into custody, authorities said. Pointing to the need to preserve the integrity of the investigation, authorities did not immediately release details such as the identities of the victims and suspect, or a possible motive. During a Friday afternoon briefing, however, the Capitol Heights and Prince George’s County police departments provided reporters with a timeline detailing the sequence of events. About 9:10 a.m., Capitol Heights police were called to a disturbance at the senior living facility, Police Chief Mark Cummings said. Upon arrival, Cummings said, officers encountered a man who said “there was a shooter in the building.” Once inside the building, officers located a shooting victim in the hallway and a second shooting victim in an office, the chief said. At that point, they secured the scene and called for backup. When Prince George’s County police arrived on scene, they set up a perimeter around the facility and activated the department’s conflict management team, Deputy Chief Lakina Webster said. Webster said her agency’s officers then located the unnamed suspect on the third floor of the facility and “he was taken into custody without incident.” READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn It’s unclear whether the two shooting victims lived or worked at Gateway Village. Webster said investigators haven’t confirmed those details. Authorities also wouldn’t address speculation that the suspect is a facility resident who recently lost his job. “To keep the integrity of the investigation, we’re not going to release that information at this time,” Webster said. A facility resident, identified only as Donald, told WJLA that he saw the shooter surrender before police took him into custody. “I saw him, the shooter, lying in the hallway with his arms stretched out and his weapon like six feet in front of him,” Donald told WJLA. “He told me to let the police know he was no threat. He was ready, he was waiting for them.” Donald said when police first arrived, they treated him with suspicion in an apparent case of mistaken identity. “When they get there, they manhandled me. They pushed me up against the wall, twisted my arm behind me and would not listen,” Donald said. “They did not realize I was the one who called them.” In the wake of the shooting, county officials turned their attention to the welfare of the facility’s 89 residents. Some of them sheltered in place while others fled to a local fire station.

(WJZ) —  Most charges were dropped Friday against a  19-year-old man initially suspected in a shooting  at Towson University last month. The State’s Attorney’s Office dropped charges of attempted first-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault for Samuel Nnam, who was released while he awaits his next hearing. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Attorney Gary Bernstein, who represents Nnam, said his client is now considered a victim in the case, which stems from a shooting that unfolded on campus in the early morning hours of Sept. 4. “All the shooting charges involving my client, Samuel Nnam, were dismissed today,” Bernstein told WJZ. About 2 a.m. Sept.  4, a fight broke out at an unsanctioned party at Freedom Square on the university’s campus. At some point, gunshots rang out. Police investigating the shooting found a female student suffering from a gunshot wound. Another student was also wounded. Neither of their injuries were deemed life-threatening. Nnam, who was carried away from the scene, was found with a gunshot wound a short time later by a stairwell on campus. “He was shot in the back, so it turns out he was one of the victims in this case,” Bernstein said. Investigators initially identified Nnam as the suspect, based on surveillance footage and evidence recovered from the scene. The 19-year-old was arrested following his discharge from an area hospital and  has been in police custody while awaiting court proceedings in the case . READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “They knew he was shot. They thought it was self-inflicted,” Bernstein said of investigators working the case. Bernstein said when detectives took a closer look at surveillance video, it was evident there was no video showing his client fire a gun. “He was in a physical dispute with another individual who had picked up money my client had dropped,” he said. “But there’s no indication on the video that he shot him.” Another consideration for the court was Nnam’s clothing from the morning of the shooting. His clothes were initially missing, but his family later found them and handed them over to authorities. It was through those factors that detectives found the evidence did not point to Nnam. Still unclear is who pulled the trigger in the Sept. 4 shooting. Currently, Nnam only faces a charge of possession of a handgun. “The detectives worked on (the case) tireless along with the State’s Attorney’s Office,” Bernstein said. “My client could have sat in jail for another year waiting for trial if they hadn’t bothered to follow it up.” Joe Herring, director of Towson University’s Office of Public Safety and chief of the university police department said the agency continues to support Baltimore County’s investigation into the shooting.

On Thursday, the hip hop star shared behind-the-scenes photos of the two of them on the set of the highly anticipated event. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “GUESS WHO BTCHS?!!!!! #Andiconda #RHOP COMING SOON ON @BRAVOTV @bravoandy 😌🙏😍✨ #Moment4Life,” the 38-year-old star wrote on Instagram alongside the carousel of pictures. Back in July, Minaj shared a trailer for the show, in which the cast talked about their lives with remixed lyrics of her hit track, “Moment 4 Life.” “I’ll be hosting the reunion. 🥳 lmk what y’all want me to ask chile🥴,” the caption read. However, Minaj has provoked plenty of controversy since then, making headlines for her anti-vax comments. Last month, the “Super Bass” hitmaker suggested in a tweet to her 22.9 million followers that Covid-19 vaccines cause impotence, despite the fact there is no link between the vaccines and infertility. After revealing that she was not attending the Met Gala in New York City because of the Covid-19 vaccine requirement, she shared an unverified story about a friend of her cousin in Trinidad becoming impotent after getting a Covid-19 shot. “His testicles became swollen,” Minaj claimed in a tweet that quickly went viral. Just over 54% of the total US population is vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Another said: “It makes absolutely no sense to have her host the reunion.” However, other viewers welcomed the idea of seeing Minaj in the hosting chair. One simply reposted the picture of Minaj and Cohen with the caption: “Obsessed 😍 #RHOP @Andy @NICKIMINAJ.” Another added: “This gonna be so freaking epic&awesome @NICKIMINAJ @Andy @BravoTV.” CNN has contacted Bravo and Andy Cohen’s representatives for comment.

Besides that, she also serves as the school’s equity liaison and summer transition coordinator. The seventh-year teacher was named Baltimore County Public Schools’ Teacher of the Year in April, standing out from a crowd of more than 150 teachers across the county. From there, Ross was among 24 teachers from throughout the state vying for the top honor. Judges narrowed the field to eight finalists and ultimately named Ross the winner.

Making the honor even better was the fact that Ross got to share the experience with her parents, Vincent and Linette. “God has truly blessed us,” Vincent Ross said. “It’s been a blessing to watch her grow and mature.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased by 0.08% to 3.7%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations dropped by eight to 783. Of those hospitalized, 592 remain in acute care and 191 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 542,886 total confirmed cases and 10,353 deaths. There are 3,933,168 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,079,021 doses. Of those, 3,988,796 are first doses with 4,330 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,627,348 second doses, 3,632 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 305,820 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 252 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 157,057 additional or booster vaccine doses, 9,053 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The state reported 84.5% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

But the positivity rate did go down to 3.7 percent and more Marylanders are choosing to get vaccinated.   The virus continues to be a serious concern for health officials in Maryland. The state is reporting more than 1,000 new cases each day.   And for anyone who’s not vaccinated there’s still a higher risk of hospitalization and death.   That’s why they’re continuing to hold these vaccine clinics to get everyone protected.   The push to get Marylanders vaccinated against COVID-19 is not letting up.   “We want to make sure that we are doing our part to knock down COVID-19,” said Paul Finley, AIM chairman for Greater Maryland First Jurisdiction, the Auxiliaries and Ministries.   Greater Emmanuel Ministries Church of God in Christ on Saturday hosted a walk-up vaccine clinic with the Maryland Department of Health.   About 50 percent of this community has received at least one shot of the vaccine.   But church leaders want to try to get more people protected.   “I know that there’s some controversy as to if people want to get vaccinated or not. But we want to tell you that the science has proven that it’s a safe endeavor,” Finley said.   Statewide, over 64 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.   In Baltimore, the COVID transmission level remains high. And the need to get more people vaccinated remains important.   “We can help each other by being vaccinated,” Finley said.   Covid-19 Vaccines remain available 7 days a week, across Baltimore and Maryland.   Both the  city  and  state health  department have a list of vaccination clinics posted online for anyone to find out how to get their shot.

Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations dropped by thirty to 753. Of those hospitalized, 555 remain in acute care and 198 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 544,219 total confirmed cases and 10,363 deaths. There are 3,936,758 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,092,740 doses. Of those, 3,992,359 are first doses with 3,563 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,630,639 second doses, 3,291 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 306,119 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 299 in the last day. On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September.

The state reported 84.6% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

Sook Chung, a doctor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Since 2015 scientists have been studying blue crabs-what diseases impact them, how warmer water temperatures affect them, which females have the best reproductive ability, etc. In preparation for the future as climate change is seen as inevitable. “Some of the traits make them stronger animals to disease resistance or growing really fast,” said Chung. A female crab was taken from our waters in the fall of 2018, one of her babies became ‘the chosen one’ or who the genetic code was cracked from. It was a team effort that took years to complete. Billions of ‘genetic bases’ were sequenced together ‘just so’ in order to create the perfect DNA of the Maryland blue crab. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “The mother came from Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay, and the funding comes from Maryland citizens so all Marylanders work together,” said Chung. So all this science basically means one thing–the blue crab will never go extinct because scientists have a complete picture of what makes up the blue crab genome. They could recreate them with their recently recorded genetic code if needed. “Your genome is written digitized, you can keep it bringing it back. I hope that never happens but yes in the long term we can bring it back,” said Chung. And the code they have would make the strongest crabs in the water. So have no fear, Maryland’s staple icon and food aren’t going anywhere.

(AP) —  Odafe Oweh has already shown he’s ready for the big stage. The Baltimore rookie had a sack in his very first NFL game. Then the following weekend, he forced a late fumble — and recovered it — to save the Ravens in a victory over Kansas City. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured He had another sack last week in a win over Denver, and now the first-round draft pick from Penn State is setting his sights on the Ravens’ next challenge, Monday night’s game against Indianapolis. “I think I’ve adjusted pretty well for a rookie,” Oweh said. “Obviously, I can get better, in terms of reading everything and playing a little bit faster, but I feel like my athleticism helps me in a lot of spaces, where a lot of other rookies would struggle — stuff like that. But there’s always room for improvement, and I’m going to get better as the games go by.” The Ravens had two first-round picks this year: Oweh and receiver Rashod Bateman. Baltimore is still waiting for Bateman to make his debut. He’s been out with groin problems. Oweh was brought in to help Baltimore’s pass rush after the Ravens lost Matt Judon, Yannick Ngakoue and Jihad Ward to free agency. Oweh did not have a sack during Penn State’s truncated 2020 season, but he had seven in his first two seasons with the Nittany Lions and already has a couple for Baltimore. “I always just tell him to stay humble and continue to work,” Ravens linebacker Justin Houston said. “The sky is the limit for that kid.” In Baltimore’s win at Denver last week, Oweh knocked quarterback Teddy Bridgewater out of the game with a hit. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn “It’s a hard-hitting game, but I had no ill intent on trying to knock him out of the game or try to make sure he wasn’t playing football for the rest of the game,” Oweh said. “There was no ill intent, but our mentality is basically to try to be the Ravens’ defense — bring physicality — and do everything that we’ve got to do safely, no penalties, and just try to play hard-hitting football.” Pro Football Focus ranks Oweh 23rd in the NFL among edge defenders, one spot behind fellow rookie — and former Penn State teammate — Micah Parsons of the Dallas Cowboys. Also in that range at No. 28 is another rookie from the Big Ten, Kwity Paye of the Colts. Paye, a first-round pick out of Michigan, has been ruled out of this game against Oweh and the Ravens because of a hamstring injury. Interestingly, Oweh’s PFF ranking is much higher — fourth among edge defenders — against the run. He says it’s important to him to be an every-down player. “That’s my goal,” he said. “Since freshman year, when they were trying to make me a pass-rush specialist, I hate that. I don’t like doing that. So, I try to make sure I’m good in every phase.” Oweh has certainly had a chance to show off for a national audience. Baltimore’s first two games this season were on a Monday night and a Sunday night, and now the Ravens are back on Monday night against the Colts. Not that Oweh seems overly concerned with attention. MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government “I think he’s a humble kid, that’s just working hard and trying to get better every day, and I think that’s one of his best traits that he has,” Ravens defensive coordinator Don Martindale said. “So, we’re looking forward to every Sunday, or in this case, Monday night, to see what comes next. But he’s done everything we’ve asked him to do, and he’s reaping rewards (for) executing defenses and pass rushes and everything else. It’s been awesome.” (© Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

A Maryland Transportation Authority police officer assigned to the Operations Support Unit saw the driver of silver Monte Carlo commit a traffic violation just after 2:45 a.m. at Interstate 395 and Conway Street and followed the car onto the I-395 ramp and then I-95 south. The driver was speeding and weaving in and out of traffic, according to the statement.

The Monte Carlo exited I-95 south onto the Baltimore Beltway, and the officer, concerned the driver was impaired, followed, according to the statement. The Monte Carlo exited I-695 at Wilkens Avenue at a high rate of speed, lost control, crossed Wilkens Avenue, hit the median and was ejected from the vehicle, according to the statement. The officer provided first aid until paramedics arrived. The male driver, who was 26, was pronounced dead at the scene. Neither the driver nor the officer was not identified in the statement.

Camera footage generally is released within 14 days of an incident, although the statement said it could take longer if investigators need more time to interview witnesses, if there are technical delays caused by the need to redact the identities of witnesses, or to allow family members to view the video before it is released to the public. The IID is investigating the incident with the assistance of the Maryland State Police Crash Team.   MORE NEWS:  Annapolis Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Military Secrets To Foreign Government                                   ", "sentiment": 0.09103174603174603, "subjectivity": 0.3966666666666666, "wordcount": 346}

In Michigan, an emergency room physician said his hospital is still overwhelmed with patients. “I had just worked a couple of shifts in a row where I had six, seven people sitting in the emergency department, waiting for beds at other hospitals that didn’t exist,” Dr. Rob Davidson said Saturday. He said some ambulances “were six, seven hours away from being able to bring them to those places.” About 52% of Michigan residents have been fully vaccinated — lower than the national average of 56.4%, according to data Saturday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).   ‘Still way too high’ New Covid-19 cases are going “in the right direction — we have less than 100,000 cases a day,” Fauci said Sunday. But the US has about 95,000 new infections reported daily, which is “still way too high,” he said. “I would like to see it well below 10,000 and even much lower than that,” Fauci said. “But when you’re at 95,000, that’s still a situation where you have a high degree of dynamic circulation of virus.” And while daily Covid-19 deaths have declined in recent weeks, an average of more than 1,600 Americans are dying from Covid-19 every day, according to data this past week from Johns Hopkins University.   Death isn’t the only terrible outcome with Covid-19 It’s important for people to understand “not dying from Covid is a great thing, but that isn’t the only metric we should be using,” Davidson said. He said at his hospital, some Covid-19 patients have been on a ventilator for more than a month, and some have endured invasive procedures to stay alive. Even if they recover physically, some Covid-19 survivors end up suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, due to time spent in the ICU, Davidson said. A study published in February found 30% of Covid-19 survivors experienced PTSD, which is a psychological illness that usually occurs after someone has a life-threatening experience. Negative effects were found in people infected in their third trimester of pregnancy, as well as their babies. Between March and September of last year, symptomatic pregnant people at one Israeli hospital had higher rates of gestational diabetes, a lower white blood cell count, and experienced heavier bleeding during their delivery. Their babies also experienced more breathing problems, a research team reported in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine. The study has limitations since it only looked at women in one hospital, so its findings may not be true for all people who are pregnant.

A  large study published last month  showed more than one-third of Covid-19 patients suffered symptoms three to six months after getting infected. Some had multiple, long-lasting complications. Breathing problems, abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were among the most common issues reported. Accompanying data showed as many as 46% of children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 22 had experienced at least one symptom in the six months after recovering.   ‘Hit the reset button,’ top health official and evangelical Christian says A recent study by the Pew Research Center showed  White evangelical Protestants were among the least likely  adults to get vaccinated. The director of the National Institutes of Health — who identifies as an evangelical Christian — said it is time for that to change. “Christians, of all people, are supposed to be particularly worried about their neighbors,” Dr. Francis Collins told CNN on Saturday. He said those who are unvaccinated are more likely to get infected and spread the coronavirus to others. But for some reason, many evangelical Christians “have had a lot of trouble, in many instances, rolling up their sleeves,” Collins said. “Much of it is this disinformation that is so widely spread on the internet, and which has, I think, caused a lot of people to be confused or fearful about what the vaccinations might do to them,” Collins said. “And that is truly heartbreaking when we see, still, more than a thousand people losing their lives to this disease (daily), almost all of them unvaccinated, and therefore didn’t have to happen,” he said. “If you are a Christian, or if you’re anybody who has not yet gotten vaccinated, hit the reset button on whatever information you have that’s causing you to be doubtful or hesitant or fearful, and look at the evidence.”   Vaccines for kids under 5 may not come until next year For children under 5, Covid-19 vaccines may not be authorized until early next year, former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Sunday. The FDA is likely to ask for more data and perhaps for studies involving more children, because it is a new vaccine and a new virus, Gottlieb told CBS’s Face the Nation. “And that could push it into 2022. Previously we had talked about trying to have that data available before the end of this year, which could have prompted an authorization perhaps by the end of the year, at least in kids ages 2-4. I think that it’s more likely that it slips into the first quarter of next year at the very least, but not too far into next year,” said Gottlieb, who is also on Pfizer’s board. The FDA has called a meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), for October 26 to discuss pediatric vaccines. Pfizer has submitted data and a formal request for authorization for its one-third dose vaccine for use in children 5-11. But Gottlieb said he expects VRBPAC to also discuss what might be needed for authorization for the youngest children. Having more information to consider can raise public confidence in the vaccines, Gottlieb said. He is already confident and plans to vaccinate his own young daughters. “There’s a lot of parents like me that, as soon as the vaccines available for their children, are going to go out and get their kids vaccinated, that see the benefits of vaccination,” he said. “There’s a lot of parents who still have a lot of questions around vaccination. I think for them, they should have a conversation with their pediatrician to try to get comfortable with the idea of vaccinating kids.” Gottlieb said he thinks it will be years before the CDC recommends making Covid-19 vaccines part of the regular childhood vaccination schedule, which would open the door to school districts mandating them. “I think it’s a very long way off. Certainly CDC’s going to look at children ages 12-17 differently than 5-11,” he said.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday it has seen a 12% increase in reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,  or MIS-C , since late August. Doctors at a handful of children’s hospitals around the country say they are still treating more MIS-C cases than they had been earlier in the year, even though MIS-C is considered rare. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured “We had a nice long break from those cases over the summer and even into the fall where we could get an occasional MIS-C case here and there, but in the last three or four weeks, there has definitely been an uptick. And I would anticipate that to continue through the next several weeks,” said Dr. Amy Edwards, an infectious disease specialist at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland. CDC said  it is aware of 5,217 cases reported through October 4. At least 46 children have died from MIS-C — a more than 12% increase in deaths from the month before and one of the largest increases this year. Overall, children are much less likely than adults to be hospitalized or to die from Covid-19.  More than 5.9 million children  have been diagnosed with Covid-19, but MIS-C cases make up a minute fraction — far less than 1%– of all cases identified among children. Doctors don’t know for sure what causes MIS-C. Often kids have Covid-19 first, but not always. For those few kids that do go on to develop MIS-C, the condition seems to inflame different parts of the body, and it can be serious. CDC advises  parents or caregivers to contact a doctor right away if a child has a fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes or extra tiredness. At Children’s National in DC, the uptick in cases just started last week, according to Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Pediatric Diseases. This wave of new MIS-C cases hasn’t been as big as two surges earlier in the year where they saw up to about 60 MIS-C patients. For this wave, they’ve had about 18 MIS-C patients so far. At Children’s Hospital Colorado, they too saw “significantly” more MIS-C cases in September, compared to previous months, according to Dr. Sam Dominguez, a pediatric disease expert at the hospital. But he said they aren’t seeing the same rates as they were seeing in December 2020 and January 2021. Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta also noted an increase in MIS-C cases in late September, about nine weeks after the area saw a spike in cases. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn During the past four weeks, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta has treated 58 children with MIS-C — nearly 20% of all the MIS-C cases they’ve treated so far — but Jennifer Burkhardt, a spokesperson for the hospital, said that MIS-C is still considered rare. It has occurred in less than 5% of the almost 7,400 children they’ve treated for Covid-19. Burkhardt said to prevent MIS-C and Covid-19, the hospital strongly recommends that everyone who is eligible get the vaccine. Georgia’s vaccination rate lags far behind the rest of the country. While more than 56% of the US population is fully vaccinated,  according to the CDC , only 48% of Georgia’s eligible population has been fully vaccinated and only 46% of Georgia’s teens have, according to the  Georgia Department of Health . The uptick in cases has not impacted the country evenly. Regions with smaller spikes in Covid-19 cases, such as Chicago, do not report an increase in MIS-C, according to Dr. Bill Muller, an infectious disease specialist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “We did see a surge of Covid-19 cases with Delta, including increased hospitalizations, but it wasn’t anywhere near what the South had,” Muller said. Doctors say that’s why vaccines are so important, even if the little children aren’t eligible to get a vaccine. The adults around them who can will help get the community’s case numbers down. If the number of Covid-19 cases are lower, there is a much smaller chance kids will develop MIS-C. The kids that seem most vulnerable to MIS-C seem to share similar demographic traits. Most reported MIS-C cases were among children and adolescents between 5 and 13, with an average age of about 9, CDC said. More than half, 59%, were in males. MIS-C has disproportionately affected children of color. In its latest update, CDC said 61% of reported cases are in children who are Latino or non-Hispanic Black. Edwards at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland said a lot of the kids they treat for MIS-C had mild or even asymptomatic coronavirus infections first. She said that’s something for parents to keep in mind. “Even if you’re not sure whether your kid had Covid, if they had mild symptoms after being exposed to somebody, but then they got better and then about a month later, they seem to be getting sick again, especially if they have a very high fever, I would err on the side of having them checked out sooner rather than later,” Edwards said. “What we know about MIS-C is the earlier you intervene, the less sick the kids seem to get.” DeBiasi at Children’s National said that they have had great success treating patients with MIS-C.  Treatment  includes fluids, respiratory support, anti-inflammatories and an  immunoglobulin infusion . “Even the sickest kids with MIS-C who are in the intensive care unit and need a lot of support, really seem to turn around relatively quickly once they get the anti-inflammatory treatment started quickly,” DeBiasi said.

The percentage of people testing positive decreased slightly by 0.16% to 3.73%. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Doctors say the new cases are fueled by dangerous strains targeting the unvaccinated. During an August press conference, Gov. Larry Hogan said the Delta variant, a strain that is reportedly two to four times more contagious than the original virus strain, accounts for nearly every new confirmed case in Maryland. “The vaccines are without a doubt our single most effective tool to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and the surging Delta variant, and Maryland’s vaccination rate continues to outpace the nation,” Hogan said. More than 3.9 million Maryland adults are fully vaccinated. Hospitalizations dropped by eight to 745. Of those hospitalized, 550 remain in acute care and 188 are in the ICU. Since the pandemic began, there were 545,028 total confirmed cases and 10,370 deaths. There are 3,938,200 Marylanders fully vaccinated. The state has administered 8,097,873 doses. Of those, 3,993,650 are first doses with 1,291 administered in the past 24 hours. They have given out 3,631,999 second doses, 1,360 in the last day. “Thanks to the millions of people who have rolled up their sleeves, Maryland continues to be one of the most vaccinated states in America,” said Governor Hogan of the eight million milestone mark. “We have achieved these numbers with strong public health outreach, innovative lottery and scholarship promotions, and a relentless focus on equity.” The state began to administer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine again in April after the CDC and FDA lifted their pause on the vaccine due to a rare blood clot found in some women. A total of 306,201 Marylanders have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, 82 in the last day. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn On September 24, after the CDC granted final approval for Pfizer’s booster, Gov. Hogan announced the immediate authorization of the booster shot for Marylanders who have received their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Hogan  had already approved use  for vulnerable populations in early September. The state has administered 166,023 additional or booster vaccine doses, 2,400 in the last day. The state reported 84.6% of all adults in Maryland have received at least one dose of the vaccine. In August, the state launched a post-vaccination infections dashboard that is updated every Wednesday. There have been 18,243 total cases among fully vaccinated Marylanders as of last Wednesday, Sept. 22. Of those cases, 1,331 vaccinated Marylanders were hospitalized, representing 8.73% of all Covid cases hospitalized in the state. One hundred fifty-six fully vaccinated Marylanders have died, representing 8.36% of lab-confirmed Covid deaths in the state.

In a criminal complaint detailing espionage-related charges against Jonathan Toebbe, the government said he sold information for nearly the past year to a contact he believed represented a foreign power. That country was not named in the court documents. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured Toebbe, 42, was arrested in West Virginia on Saturday along with his wife, Diana, 45, after he had placed a removable memory card at a prearranged “dead drop” in the state, according to the Justice Department. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the Toebbes, who are from Annapolis, Maryland, have lawyers. The Navy declined to comment Sunday. The FBI says the scheme began in April 2020 when Jonathan Toebbe sent a package of Navy documents to a foreign government and wrote that he was interested in selling to that country operations manuals, performance reports and other sensitive information. Authorities say he also provided instructions for how to conduct the furtive relationship, with a letter that said: “I apologize for this poor translation into your language. Please forward this letter to your military intelligence agency. I believe this information will be of great value to your nation. This is not a hoax.” That package, which had a return address in Pittsburgh, was obtained by the FBI last December through its legal attache office in the unspecified foreign country. The court documents don’t explain how the FBI came to receive the package or from whom. In any event, the FBI used Toebbe’s outreach as the launching pad for a monthslong undercover operation in which an agent posing as a representative of a foreign contact made contact with Toebbe and agreed to pay thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency for the information that Toebbe was offering. After weeks of back and forth over email, the undercover agent in June sent Toebbe about $10,000 in cryptocurrency, describing it as a sign of good faith and trust, the FBI says. Weeks later, federal agents watched as the Toebbes arrived at an agreed-upon location in West Virginia for the exchange, with Diana Toebbe appearing to serve as a lookout for her husband during a dead-drop operation for which the FBI paid $20,000. The FBI recovered a blue memory card wrapped in plastic and placed between two slices of bread on a half of a peanut butter sandwich, court documents say. The records on the memory card included design elements and performance characteristics of Virginia-class submarine reactors. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The Justice Department describes those submarines as “cruise missile fast-attack submarines, which incorporate the latest in stealth, intelligence gathering, and weapons systems technology.” The memory card also included a typed message that said, in part: “I hope your experts are very happy with the sample provided and I understand the importance of a small exchange to grow our trust.” The FBI conducted similar dead-drop exchanges over the next several months, including one in August in eastern Virginia for which Toebbe was paid roughly $70,000. In that instance, prosecutors say, he concealed in a chewing gum package a memory card that contained schematic designs for the Virginia-class submarine. The complaint alleges violations of the Atomic Energy Act, which restricts the disclosure of information related to atomic weapons or nuclear materials. The Toebbes are expected to have their initial court appearances Tuesday in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Jonathan Toebbe has worked for the U.S. government since 2012, holding a top-secret security clearance and specializing in naval nuclear propulsion, the FBI says. He has also been assigned to a government-owned laboratory in the Pittsburgh area that officials say works on nuclear power for the U.S. Navy. No one answered at the Toebbe residence on Sunday afternoon in a waterside Annapolis community by the South River. An outside light was on above the door of their home, and a dog barked inside. John Cooley, who lives across the street from the Toebbes, said he counted more than 30 FBI agents on his block on Saturday from about 2:30 p.m. until after dark. He said agents went inside the home.

Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over the weekend and the Dallas-based airline accounted for nearly half of the flight cancellations worldwide Sunday. Another 363 flights were canceled Monday, leaving grounded flyers fed up. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The surge in cancellations upended people’s weekend plans, including those of Stan and Terri Dorsey, who were stranded in Baltimore while traveling from Pennsylvania to Portland, Maine. “Six hours we stood in line to get rebooked. Six hours with one gate agent rebooking hundreds of people,” said Terri Dorsey, adding that the couple boarded a flight at one point only to be told to get off. But it wasn’t a total loss, according to her husband, who joked that he was able to watch two football games just while standing in line. “It’s like, oh my goodness. We’re in Baltimore!

In a Sunday tweet, however, the Federal Aviation Administration pushed back against the airline’s explanation for canceled or delayed flights. “No FAA air traffic staffing shortages have been reported since Friday,” the tweet said. “Flight delays & cancellations occurred for a few hours Friday PM due to widespread severe weather, military training, & limited staffing in one area of the Jacksonville en route center. Some airlines continue to experience scheduling challenges due to aircraft and crews being out of place.” The Southwest Airline Pilots Association, the airline’s pilots union, last week asked a federal court to block the airline’s request that employees get vaccinated against COVID-19. According to CBS News, the  union has distanced its members from the delays and cancellations . “SWAPA is aware of operational difficulties affecting Southwest Airlines today due to a number of issues, but we can say with confidence that our pilots are not participating in any official or unofficial job actions,” the union said.

(AP) —  Four Maryland police officers will not be charged for fatally shooting a Black man they said fired first during a late-night foot chase in January. A Maryland grand jury declined to charge the officers from the Gaithersburg Police Department due to lack of evidence in a decision announced last week. READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The four officers were members of a plainclothes street crimes unit and told investigators they saw a “muzzle flash” from a gun aimed at them by Kwamena Ocran, 24, according to their recorded statements released by Montgomery County prosecutors. One of the officers said he heard a round pass by his head. All four officers fired on Ocran, who was running away from them. He was hit eight times, including twice in his “left lateral back,” according to a 12-page report of the case from prosecutors. The officers involved were Sgt. Willie Delgado, Officer Kyle Khuen, Cpl. Larbi Dakkouni, and Officer James Doyle. The shooting happened outside the Chelsea Park apartments in central Gaithersburg on Jan. 8 after they said they received a tip that Ocran was illegally carrying a gun he intended to sell, according to the prosecutors’ report. The four officers remain on administrative leave while Gaithersburg police conduct their own internal investigation. The incident was not recorded on video because, at the time, Gaithersburg’s plainclothes officers were to required to wear body cameras. Another officer, who was wearing a camera, arrived at the scene moments later and recorded footage of a gun next to Ocran’s body but investigators could not find physical evidence that he had fired it. Crime scene technicians failed to find shell casings from Ocran’s gun in three different metal detector sweeps of the scene. They were only able to find the 23 shell casings from the officers’ guns, prosecutors said. READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn Howard County Deputy State’s Attorney Christopher Sandmann said that while investigators had prepped Ocran’s hands for gunshot reside analysis, there was a “mistake or miscommunication” and Ocran’s hands were never swabbed for the test, he told  The Washington Post . According to Sandmann and Howard County State’s Attorney Rich Gibson, investigators did find gunshot residue on the right sleeve of Ocran, but grand jurors were told by an expert witness that it could have been transferred by the officers gunshots. Gibson and Sandmann said the lack of evidence does not mean the officers are lying and that it could have been lost in the mud. Brian McDaniel, an attorney for Ocran’s mother, said the family maintains the officers killed Ocran illegally and he never shot at them. “He was my youngest child. They took him away from me,” Ocran’s mother, Melody Cooper told The Washington Post “He was a great brother, a great son, a great uncle. He had his whole life in front of him.” McDaniel said he expects to receive the full investigation files from prosecutors so he can conduct an independent probe. Police began their investigation into Ocran in December when they received a tip that Ocran, who was recently incarcerated for robbery, carried a gun which is illegal for someone with his criminal record. The tip indicated Ocran had said he was “not going back to jail” and would “shoot it out,” the prosecutors’ report said.

But parents are wondering when exactly the money will arrive. Last month’s check came on September 15 for those with direct deposit, or soon after for those dependent on the U.S. postal system. This month’s payment will be sent on October 15. Advance payments will continue next month and through the end of the year, thanks to the American Rescue Plan passed back in March. Though another round of stimulus checks seems to have been shelved, Democratic lawmakers are looking to extend the advance Child Tax Credit through 2025. Families can use the Child Tax Credit money however they like. That means the extra $250 or $300 per child can be put toward essentials like food or rent. It may also be spent on school supplies or a new computer, should COVID push students back into remote learning. Other households may apply the money toward piano lessons, daycare or even diapers. Regardless, the money comes at a time when much of the other pandemic aid —  most recently the extra unemployment insurance — has ended. Knowing that additional income is coming allows for a measure of security and flexibility in a world that’s full of surprises. How Much Should Your Check Be? READ MORE:  'He's An Extremely Lucky Individual': Home Explosion In Edgewood Leaves Man Seriously Injured The IRS is paying $3,600 total per child to parents of children up to five years of age. That drops to $3,000 for each child ages six through 17. Half of the total is being paid as six monthly payments and half as a 2021 tax credit. So each month through December parents of a younger child are receiving $300, and parents of an older child are receiving $250. The IRS has also made a one-time payment of $500 for dependents age 18 or full-time college students up through age 24.   Share information about the advance  #ChildTaxCredit  to help eligible families who are not required to file taxes register now to get monthly payments. See  #IRS  resources at  https://t.co/2G6i7dXm0z *Thanks Logan for helping us spread the word!*  pic.twitter.com/L95TXCQJfb   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 11, 2021 The updated Child Tax Credit is based on parents’ modified adjusted gross income (AGI), as reflected on their 2020 tax filing. (AGI is the sum of one’s wages, interest, dividends, alimony, retirement distributions and other sources of income minus certain deductions, such as student loan interest, alimony payments and retirement contributions.) The amount  phases out  at a rate of $50 for every $1,000 of annual income beyond $75,000 for an individual and beyond $150,000 for a married couple. The benefit is fully refundable, meaning it does not depend on the recipient’s current tax burden. Qualifying families receive the full amount, regardless of what they owe in taxes. There is no limit to the number of dependents that can be claimed. For example, suppose a married couple has a three-year-old child and a seven-year-old child and showed an annual joint income of $120,000 on their 2020 taxes. The IRS is sending them $550 per month. That’s $300 per month ($3,600 / 12) for the younger child and $250 per month ($3,000 / 12) for the older child. Those payments will last through December. The couple would then receive the $3,300 balance — $1,800 ($300 X 6) for the younger child and $1,500 ($250 X 6) for the older child — as part of their 2021 tax refund. Parents of a child who ages out of an age bracket are paid the lesser amount. That means if a five-year-old turns six in 2021, the parents will receive a total credit of $3,000 for the year, not $3,600. Likewise, if a 17-year-old turns 18 in 2021, the parents are receiving $500, not $3,000. An income increase in 2021 to an amount above the $75,000 ($150,000) threshold could lower a household’s Child Tax Credit. The IRS has confirmed that they’ll soon allow claimants to adjust their income and custodial information online, thus lowering their payments. Failure to do so could increase one’s tax bill or reduce one’s tax refund once 2021 taxes are filed. Eligibility requires that the dependent be a part of the household for at least half of the year and be at least half supported by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who makes above $95,000 ($170,000) — where the Credit phases out entirely — will not be eligible for the expanded credit. But they can still claim the existing $2,000 credit per child. How Do You Make Changes For Future Payments? The IRS has three different tools to help recipients and potential recipients update their information on file, register and check eligibility. Child Tax Credit Update Portal READ MORE:  Robbery Suspect Found Dead After Shootout With Police In Woodlawn The  Child Tax Credit Update Portal  allows users to make sure they are registered to receive advance payments. It also lets recipients unenroll from advance payments in favor of a one-time credit when filing their 2021 taxes. The deadline for the next payment was October 4. (Subsequent opt-out deadlines for future payments will occur three days before the first Thursday of the month from which a person is opting out.) Here are the remaining opt-out deadlines:   Payment Date: November 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 1   Payment Date: December 15 / Opt-Out Deadline: November 29   The tool also allows users to add or modify bank account information for direct deposit, view their payment history, and update their mailing address. Other features coming to the portal include changing one’s income and dependents. To access this portal, users need an IRS username or an ID.me account. ID.me is a sign-in service used by various government agencies, including the IRS, Social Security Administration and Treasury Department, to authenticate users. Users need valid photo identification to create an account.   Some families may prefer to wait until the end of the year and receive the entire  #ChildTaxCredit  instead of receiving advance payments. An  #IRS  tool lets them do just that:  https://t.co/Qt9TAuwjvv   pic.twitter.com/OEok6WQhII   — IRSnews (@IRSnews)  October 11, 2021 Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool The  Child Tax Credit Non-Filer Sign-Up Tool  is to help parents of children born before 2021 who don’t typically file taxes but qualify for advance Child Tax Credit payments. That means parents who have not filed their 2020 taxes, are not required to file, and don’t plan to file. (Parents who claimed their dependents on their 2019 tax return should not use this tool.) Users enter their personal information, including their name, mailing address, email address, date of birth, relevant social security numbers, bank account information, and identity protection PIN. The IRS uses the information to check eligibility and, once confirmed, will begin making payments. The IRS and experts advise using the tool on a desktop or laptop computer rather than a mobile device. Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant The  Child Tax Credit Eligibility Assistant  lets parents check if they are eligible to receive advance Child Tax Credit payments. Users will need a copy of their 2020 tax return or, barring that, their 2019 tax return. It’s also fine to estimate income and expenses from the appropriate tax year, though the result may not be accurate. The assistant asks multiple questions to determine eligibility, but does not ask for sensitive information. No entries are recorded.
