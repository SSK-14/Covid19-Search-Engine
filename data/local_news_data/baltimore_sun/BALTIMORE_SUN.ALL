Another coronavirus vaccine is in the works in Maryland labs
.W
Two Maryland biotech firms said Tuesday they will join the effort to make a vaccine against the new coronavirus that is sickening people in the state and across the globe. Emergent BioSolutions Inc. will produce the experimental vaccine that was developed by Novavax Inc. to protect against COVID-19 by using a genetically engineered protein nanoparticle technology. The effort is among others in government and private labs to develop a vaccine on an expedited basis, though a commercially available product isn’t expected immediately. Government health officials say it will be a year to a year and a half before one is developed, tested for safety and efficacy and manufactured for public use. Emergent said testing in humans for safety, a phase 1 trial, would begin in the next four months. Emergent is a Gaithersburg-based company that makes its own vaccines and other therapies and produces them for other pharmaceutical companies. It has two in Baltimore that will be involved in the production. Gaithersburg-based Novavax makes vaccines for known and emerging infectious diseases. Emergent has contracts with the federal government agencies, including the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services, to produce vaccines to counter public health threats such as anthrax and flu, as well as develop new defenses against the Zika and Ebola viruses and cyanide exposure. “The increasing threat of COVID-19 requires a comprehensive response and we continue to evaluate various vaccine, therapeutic, and [contract manufacturing] approaches to enable us to marshal resources to make a meaningful impact on this global public health emergency,” said Robert G. Kramer Sr., Emergent’s president and CEO, in a statement. Emergent said drug substances will be produced at the company’s plant by the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and final products will be produced at the fill, finish and packaging facility in the Carroll-Camden Industrial Area. Novavax also announced Tuesday that it was awarded $4 million to accelerate coronavirus vaccine development from the foundation Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the pair were in discussions about additional funding for the coming trial. “This first stage of funding from CEPI is critical to enable ongoing development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidates,” said Stanley C. Erck, president and CEO of Novavax. “We commend CEPI for its role as a vital partner to bridge the funding gap for innovative biotech companies like Novavax, which have robust vaccine technology platforms. Novavax is working tirelessly to create a vaccine against this growing epidemic.” The University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development also is already working on a vaccine for the new virus as part of a consortium established by the National Institutes of Health at Emory University in Atlanta to quickly tackle new infectious diseases. Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, director of the Maryland center, is co-leading the project, has said the group’s vaccine will be based on a vaccine for another coronavirus and the initial trial would be in the spring.

First Baltimore City case of coronavirus confirmed
.W
Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Saturday night confirmed the city’s first case of the new coronavirus. The patient is a man in his 60s, according to a statement from the mayor’s office. Few details were provided on the case, including where in the city the man lives; Young said the city health department is investigating. "We don’t have any additional information beyond what’s been released,” said Lester Davis, a spokesman for Young. Young urged all residents to take precautions against the respiratory virus, “especially our older adult population who are at higher risk for contracting this virus.” The city has canceled permitted gatherings of more 250 or more people. Activities are canceled at senior centers. And schools and recreation centers are closed for the next two weeks. Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said city officials have worked closely with other government agencies to respond. "Our staff has been preparing for this possibility for the last two months, and will be working with all appropriate local, state, and federal agencies to address COVID-19,” she said in a statement. "Social distancing remains of the utmost of importance as we aim to limit the spread of COVID-19.” State officials said Saturday they have confirmed 26 cases of coronavirus in Maryland, up from 19 on Friday. On Friday night, Johns Hopkins Hospital officials confirmed a “provider” there has tested positive for COVID-19, but provided few details, including the person’s gender or role at the medical institution. It was not clear late Saturday whether the city case was part of the state’s total count of 26, or whether it was a separate case from the one announced earlier by Hopkins.

Harford reporting its first ‘probable’ coronavirus deaths
.W
Harford County has its first deaths likely related to the new coronavirus, as the Maryland Department of Health began announcing “probable” deaths due to COVID-19 for the first time on Wednesday. Three people have likely died in Harford due to the respiratory disease, according to state data. “A death is classified as probable if the person’s death certificate lists COVID19 as the cause of death, but it has not yet been confirmed by a laboratory test,” tweeted Kata D. Hall, Gov. Larry Hogan’s deputy communications director. Details of the three probable deaths were not immediately available. Confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Harford went up by five on Wednesday, to 152. The Aberdeen ZIP code 21001, showed eight confirmed cases of coronavirus there. It is the first time that community has registered since the state began releasing data by ZIP code earlier this week. For privacy purposes, the state does not list the number of cases by ZIP code if it is seven of fewer. Bel Air and Edgewood remain the most affected communities in Harford. There are 42 total confirmed cases between Bel Air’s two ZIP codes and 34 confirmed cases in Edgewood. Abingdon (16), Forest Hill (13) and Joppa (13) are the only other ZIP codes in Harford with more than seven confirmed cases. Statewide, the number of cases surpassed 10,000 for the first time, including 413 Marylanders reported to have died from the virus — 349 confirmed and 64 probable deaths. This story may be updated.

Corporations are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic | COMMENTARY
.W
Societies gripped by cataclysmic wars, depressions or pandemics can become acutely sensitive to power and privilege. Weeks before the coronavirus virus crushed the U.S. stock market, Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina apparently used information he gleaned from his role as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee about the ferocity of the coming pandemic to unload 33 stocks held by him and his spouse, estimated at between $628,033 and $1.72 million, in some industries likely to be hardest hit by the global outbreak. While publicly parroting Mr. Trump’s happy talk at the time, Mr. Burr confided to several of his political funders that the disease would be comparable to the deadly 1918 flu pandemic. Then the market tanked, along with the retirement savings of millions of Americans. Even some pundits on Fox News are now calling for Mr. Burr’s resignation. When society faces a common threat, exploiting a special advantage is morally repugnant. Call it "Burring." However tolerable Burring may be in normal times, it isn't now. In normal times, corporations get special favors from Washington in exchange for generous campaign contributions, and no one bats an eye. Recall the Trump tax cut, which delivered $1.9 trillion to big corporations and the wealthy. Yet the coronavirus should have altered business as usual. The most recent Senate Republican relief package, which would give airlines $58 billion and give billions more to other industries, is pure Burring. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried lamely to distinguish it from the notorious bank bailouts of 2008. “We are not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes,” Mr. McConnell said. “We are talking about loans, which must be repaid, for American employers whom the government itself is temporarily crushing for the sake of public health.” But the airlines are big enough to get their own loans from banks at rock-bottom interest rates. Their planes and landing slots are more than adequate collateral. Why do airlines deserve to be bailed out? Over the last decade they spent 96% of their free cash flow, including billions in tax savings from the Trump tax cut, to buy back shares of their own stock. This boosted executive bonuses and pleased wealthy investors but did nothing to strengthen the airlines for the long term. Meanwhile, the four biggest carriers gained so much market power they jacked up prices on popular routes and slashed services. (Remember legroom and free bag checks?) United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz did his own Burring last week, warning that if Congress doesn't bailout the airline by the end of March, United will start firing its employees. But even if bailed out, what are the odds United would keep paying all its workers if the pandemic forced it to stop flying? The bailout would be for shareholders and executives, not employees. While generous toward airlines and other industries, the Republican bill is absurdly stingy toward people, stipulating a one-time payment of up to $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. Some 64 million households with incomes below $50,000 would get as little as $600. This will do almost nothing to help job-losers pay their mortgages, rents and other bills for the duration of the crisis, expected to last at least the next three months. The Republican coronavirus bill is about as Burring as legislation can be — exposing the underlying structure of power in America as clearly as Mr. Burr’s stock trades. In this national crisis, it’s just as morally repulsive. Take a look at how big corporations are treating their hourly workers in this pandemic and you see more Burring. Walmart, the largest employer in America, doesn’t give its employees paid sick leave and limits its 500,000 part-time workers to 48 hours paid time off per year. This policy is now threatening countless lives. (In one survey, 88% of Walmart employees reported sometimes coming to work when sick.) None of the giants of the fast-food industry — McDonald’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Dunkin’ Donuts, Wendy’s, Taco Bell, Subway — give their workers paid sick leave, either. Amazon, one of the richest corporations in the world, which paid almost no taxes last year, is offering unpaid time off for workers who are sick and just two weeks' paid leave for workers who test positive for the virus. Meanwhile, it demands that its employees put in mandatory overtime. And here's the most Burring thing of all: These corporations have made sure they and other companies with more than 500 employees are exempt from the requirement in the House coronavirus bill that employers provide paid sick leave. At a time when almost everyone feels burdened and fearful, the use of power and privilege to exploit the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of others is morally intolerable. We are all in this together, or should be. Whatever form it takes, Burring must be stopped. Robert Reich’s new book, “The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It,” will be out in March.

What is coronavirus and what precautions should people be taking? 
.W
An outbreak of hundreds of cases of a new coronavirus has resulted in at least 132 deaths, more than 6,000 cases and travel restrictions that are affecting millions of people in China. The fifth case of the respiratory illness in the United States was confirmed in Arizona on Sunday. Other cases, all among travelers from China, were reported in California, Illinios and Washington state. There are dozens of cases under investigation, including one in Maryland. With the virus hitting close to home, what can people do to stay healthy? What is coronavirus? Human coronaviruses are common throughout the world, causing respiratory illnesses that result in runny noses, sore throats and coughs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus is named for nobs that protrude from its surface, making it resemble a crown, an expert said. The virus family includes the common cold, as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS, which spread to dozens of countries, sickening more than 8,000 and killing 774 people before it was contained in 2003, according to the CDC. Also in the virus family is MERS, a respiratory illness that emerged in 2012 and is associated with a high mortality rate. Now, scientists have identified a new coronavirus that was first confirmed in Wuhan, China. It can cause a more severe illness than a typical cold, according to Michael Ison, a professor of infectious diseases and organ transplantation at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. To try to contain the outbreak, the Chinese government has ordered a travel lockdown in central China after about 260 cases were identified in Wuhan. As of Wednesday, more than 6,000 have been infected globally, mostly in China. What are the symptoms? The virus can result in a runny nose, sore throat and cough, experts say. It can develop into a fever and lung infection that causes shortness of breath. People should see a doctor if they experience a worsening cough, experts said. “The illness can start like a regular cold. You feel crummy,” Ison said. Dr. Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Texas Southwestern, said patients have presented with fever, malaise and a dry cough. Ison said there is a polymerase chain reaction test, or PCR test, available to identify the virus, but it is currently only available at the CDC. Officials expect labs run by state health departments, including the one in Maryland, to be able to test people soon. So far, the fatality rate from the new virus is relatively low and usually confined to the elderly or those with an underlying medical condition, Ison said, but he noted that could change as more cases emerge. How likely are you to get it? Experts say the likelihood of Americans who haven’t recently traveled to China contracting the new virus is relatively low. “We know how to control these viruses,” said Perl, though she cautioned that there is a lot scientists don’t know yet about the new virus. “There are control measures that people might find invasive, but really, we can control this.” The CDC said this week that screening of travelers will be expanded to 20 airports. Doctors remind people that it’s flu season, and they should be taking precautions to avoid contracting a wide variety of illnesses. “Everyone is fixated on the coronavirus but there is a relatively low number of cases,” Ison said. “There have been thousands of deaths already this year of influenza.” What precautions can you take? Experts remind people to make sure they are frequently washing their hands and not going to work if they start to show symptoms — not just to ward off the new coronavirus, but also the more common flu and other viruses. “Use of just simple masks reduces transmission,” Perl said. Doctors say it’s not too late to get a flu shot to ward off influenza, though it would not protect people from the new strain of coronavirus. There are no approved treatments for the new coronavirus, Ison said. It is either cleared by the patient’s immune system and they recover, or the patient dies of the infection. “If they can continue doing simple things ... that’s going to help,” Perl said. What’s happening in Maryland? Several researchers in Maryland are contributing to the effort to prepare for and treat coronaviruses. Hospitals are all prepared to handle a potential case, though officials ask people who believe they may have become infected to call a medical provider first to be pre-screened. Johns Hopkins Hospital has a Biocontainment Unit able to care for patients particularly sick and possibly highly contagious. Local universities and colleges, as well as businesses, which have international students, faculty and workers, have sent alerts with CDC guidelines about monitoring for symptoms and reporting potential cases among those who have traveled in the past two weeks. Local health departments and the state health department are in contact with the state’s Emergency Operations Center to coordinate any response needed. “At my direction, the state is taking every precaution to prepare and mobilize whatever resources are necessary to address the coronavirus.” Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement. “Our state government team is in close communication with federal officials and will continue to remain so on an ongoing basis.” He also emphasized that while the threat in Maryland remains low, officials are taking the matter seriously and are encouraging Marylanders to stay informed.

Not all is equal with coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
As I hunker down in my house, protected from COVID-19, I know that there are those without homes who expose themselves to coronavirus everyday. I stuff my refrigerator with groceries to limit venturing out, but know too many can’t afford to stockpile food. Friends have ventured into low-income neighborhoods to find hand sanitizer, meat and toilet paper, where people don’t have the means to hoard. Shelves were bare closer to home. I work safely from my dining room table, but know there are others who must report to hourly wage jobs, some with no sick leave, that put them in harm’s way of contracting a deadly virus, and bringing it home to their families. They can’t afford not to go to work. The coronavirus pandemic is exposing the steep wealth gaps in this country that have always existed, but too many people found easy to ignore when unemployment was low and the stock market booming. There were always kids who got their main meals from school and college students barely surviving. Now, these inequalities are hitting us smack in the face. Sure people had jobs, but how well did those jobs pay when people are struggling with rent just a couple of weeks into the pandemic? One lost paycheck and they can’t cover all their expenses. A survey last summer by Bankrate found that nearly three in 10, or 28%, of U.S. adults have no emergency savings, and one in four have a rainy day fund, but not enough money squirreled away to cover three months of expenses. We are now starting to see the consequences of living paycheck to paycheck, something many people don’t have a choice but to do. Across the country 3.3 million people applied for jobless benefits last week, including nearly 42,000 in Maryland, and that number will continue to grow. How many of them will be able to make that money, which is just part of their normal income, stretch far enough to pay for basic necessities? And that gig economy that supposedly gave people such flexibility and freedom? The other side of that story is that many people were also forced into these gigs as second jobs to make ends meet. As people are laid off, working for the likes of Uber, DoorDash and Instacart are now primary sources of income that likely don’t cover the bills. The white collar professionals are not the ones keeping the country churning right now. It is the janitors, grocery clerks, delivery people and home health care workers taking care of the sick and homebound. They are putting their lives at risk so that rest of us aren’t woefully inconvenienced. Many work with no protective gear and with hope and mercy that they won’t contract the deadly respiratory virus. And if they do, that they won’t be one of the ones to die. COVID-19 is killing young and old, healthy and ill. Already there are stories of Amazon warehouse workers and postal employees who have contracted the virus — and many others who are scared they will be next. A Maryland Transmit Administration bus driver in Baltimore now has the virus, which resulted in disrupted service, and another hardship for people who need public transportation to get to work or even the grocery store for food. Not to mention, who knows how many people the driver exposed to the virus. It is up to the rest of us to have compassion for those who are putting their lives at risk and act accordingly. Stay home. It’s not that hard. I for one am not leaving the house unless absolutely necessary. I try to order groceries online ahead of time and pick them up so I don’t have to go in the store. We must all practice selflessness and put human lives before our own comfort levels. Stir crazy is the way I feel most days, but I try not to whine too much and make myself feel better with walks outside with my husband. After all, we have it better than a lot of people. No one knows how long this pandemic will last, or how much more damage it will inflict on the economy and further expose wealth inequalities. If we learn anything when we get to the other side of this pandemic, may it be that we take better care of the country’s most vulnerable. We cannot continue to be a place where the haves and have nots live such disparately different lives. Andrea K. McDaniels is The Sun’s deputy editorial page editor.

Life goes on amid coronavirus: Tell us your story
.W
One month has passed since we first asked readers to share snapshots of daily life amid coronavirus through emailed essays and photographs. Since then, some of us have lost jobs or gotten ill, many of us have experienced the kindnesses of others, and most of us have endured moments of extreme frustration and boredom. Now, with a phased reopening in sight, we’d like to ask for your stories and images again, this time in partnership with the Maryland Historical Society. The organization has launched a “Collecting in Quarantine” initiative to capture how Marylanders are living through this unique moment in history. The hope is that 100 years from how, these tales and pictures will lend historical perspective to our nation’s next challenge — much like stories of the 1918 flu informed our response to the novel coronavirus. Send your stories, in 450 words or fewer, of lessons learned and life lived to talkback@baltimoresun.com with the subject line “CORONAVIRUS STORY.” Include your name, phone number and street address for verification purposes. We’ll edit and compile our favorites for later publication in The Sun, and share them with the Maryland Historical Society for potential inclusion in their collection, which will be saved for future generations. The Baltimore Sun editorial board — made up of Opinion Editor Tricia Bishop, Deputy Editor Andrea K. McDaniels and writer Peter Jensen — offers opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers. It is separate from the newsroom.

How cancer prepared me for coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
Recovering from cancer and chemotherapy is a challenge on its own. But having to deal with that, along with my job as a high school sports reporter and the outbreak of the coronavirus has been intriguing, to say the least. I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma just a little over a month after I began working with the Baltimore Sun Media last summer. From July until January, I had 12 rounds of chemotherapy, along with the sickness and all of the horrific side effects — including the overwhelming thoughts that went through my head on a daily basis. Would I accidentally touch someone who had a cold or the flu? What could I do if I got sick? During the course of my chemotherapy, I kept disinfectant wipes and spray, vitamin C powder, hand sanitizer, face masks and a number of other items at the ready to protect my health. I still got sick, however. There were days after my treatments where I’d get a cold, it would go away, and then I would get treatment two weeks later and get sick once again. After the chemo ended Jan. 20 — the same day the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S. — it left me with a weakened immune system for several weeks. Simply doing my job became worrisome. As a high school sports reporter, I often introduce myself with a handshake, which can lead to the transfer of germs — germs that could ravage my immune system. Packed gyms are also a hotbed for viruses and bacteria, as players sweat, students and other fans cough and sneeze. Then there was church. I’m in the midst of taking Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults classes to join the Catholic faith. Weeks ago, there were still handshakes, and people dipping their fingers into the holy water and passing the communal cup of wine. All of that was detrimental to me. But as my immune system strengthened, the precautions others took because of coronavirus grew. Churches and other houses of worship stopped encouraging touching, first, then stopped congregating altogether. Same with sports. All public schools are closed in Maryland for the next two weeks, and any sporting events cancelled. Even the professional sports teams are taking a pause: The National Basketball Association suspended its regular season, Major League Baseball canceled spring training and delayed the season’s start, the National Hockey League suspended games, the PGA Tour cancelled the Player’s Championship, and so on. The times that we live in are so strange. I may not be immuno-compromised anymore, but I’m still well prepared. Every day that I step into the office at The Baltimore Sun, which may not be for too much longer as we move to a telework model, I wipe down my desk with disinfectant wipes. Before that, I wipe down my steering wheel before driving into work. I have loads of antibacterial soap at the house, along with wipes and other things. I’ll also wash my hands before and after every meal, going to the gym, usage of electronics, etc. In the event that I get sick or others around me are coughing, I have three boxes of protective face masks at my office, at my home and in my car. Cancer prepared me well for the coronavirus. I get the irony: Something that nearly killed me, trained me to beat something that’s killing others. Some 130,000 people are infected worldwide, and 5,000 people have died — many of them because of compromised immune systems. I’m no longer in that demographic, and I’m thankful for it every day. I also understand why I have to continue to protect myself to protect others. If I get coronavirus, I will likely shake it off relatively quickly as a young, now healthy person. But I could pass it on to someone who’s struggling, like I once was. So, let me leave you with this: Please wash your hands and clean — profusely. You aren’t just in control of your health right now. You have a large responsibility for the health of people who are immunocompromised, the very young and the elderly. With so many people at risk, you have a duty to keep them safe. It’s time for all of us to re-evaluate our hygiene and make it a priority for others to emulate so that we can prevent another outbreak such as this one. This isn’t about just you or just me. It’s about all of us, caring for each other. Kyle J. Andrews (kandrews@baltsun.com) is a high school sports reporter for the Baltimore Sun Media Group.

McDaniel College moves spring semester teaching online, cancels events in response to coronavirus
.W
McDaniel College announced Tuesday that all instruction for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester will move online after spring break. The move affects graduate and undergraduate programs, and will begin March 23. Colleges around the state have been closing their campuses and in-person gatherings as the coronavirus also known by the disease it causes, COVID-19, spreads around the United States. The Westminster college has not yet made a decision about whether to hold commencement ceremonies for students earning master’s and bachelor’s degrees currently scheduled for May 23. The college also canceled all events on the campus for the rest of the semester in order to follow the state government’s mandate against gatherings of more than 50 people. These cancellations include cultural events and performances, lectures, and large-format admissions and alumni events. Any changes regarding athletics will be made after decisions are announced from the Centennial Conference. The McDaniel College Coronavirus Task Force sent a message to the campus Tuesday, calling the move to an online format a “difficult but necessary decision.” Residence Life will communicate with students in the coming few days about how to move items out of residence halls. The college had previously closed the residences to students except for a small number who applied for approval to stay. Only visitors with appointments are permitted to access the campus. “Faculty and staff will be receiving further communication about their options during this time,” according to an email announcement. The college posted a list of contact information for services that will be available during online instruction, such as academic and student support services. The Wellness Center will be reachable by phone, at 410-857-2243, or email, wellness@mcdaniel.edu, during business hours Monday through Friday. Two cases of the coronavirus, also known by the disease it causes, COVID-19, have been confirmed in Carroll County as of Tuesday morning. At least 57 people have confirmed COVID-19 infections in the state as of Tuesday morning, according to Mike Ricci, spokesman for Hogan, though the second Carroll case was not included in that total. The all-campus message concluded, “Please know that the College remains committed to our students-first mission. We are dedicated to our students and their future. Thank you to our tremendous campus community for your flexibility and adaptability to the sudden changes that have been required during this uncertain time. We are here to support you and look forward to your physical return back to the Hill.” The college continues to provide updates and information through its COVID-19 webpage at www.mcdaniel.edu. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the health department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 am. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Other cancellations and closings Effective at end of business March 17, Piney Run and Bear Branch nature centers, as well as Hap Baker Firearms Facility, are closed until further notice. Piney Run Park will be open from 7 a.m. to sunset on weekdays only. The gate house and boat house will be closed, and no boating will be permitted. The Historical Society of Carroll County announced that it would be closed through March 27. That includes exhibit galleries, historic houses, the gift shop and library. Additionally, all events have been canceled through April 4. Manchester’s Town Hall was closed to the public until the end of March or early April. All town meetings during that time have been canceled and not been rescheduled. The town is placing priority on vital services including police and public safety, water and wastewater services. Charlotte’s Quest Nature Center in Manchester canceled all upcoming events until a later date, but the nature center area remains open for hiking and other outdoor activities. The center encouraged people to get fresh air and exercise while practicing social distancing. Bulk trash pickup in Hampstead scheduled for March 21 was postponed in order to limit person-to-person contact. A new date has not been determined as of March 17, but the town will reach out to residents when one is chosen. Regular trash/recycling collection will continue as scheduled.

Second Maryland resident gets tested for coronavirus
.W
A second person is being tested for the coronavirus in Maryland, after the first person tested negative last week. The new virus continues to sicken and kill people, largely in China where cases were first discovered. It has crept into other countries, and there are now 11 people who have tested positive in the United States. Health officials have been preparing for more. The state health department has not released information about the people being tested or where they are located. The first person tested was in isolation at home. The health department would not say whether the second person being tested for the virus, which causes respiratory symptoms, is at home or in a hospital. All hospitals in the state are prepared to quarantine patients, and those considered particularly sick could go to a specially prepared Biocontainment Unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Other measures have been taken across the country to try and stave off the coronavirus, a family of viruses that includes SARS, MERS and the common cold. Most people with the virus have been travelers, but since the virus has been found to transmit from person to person, anyone coming from China is subject to inspection and quarantine to prevent further spread. China also has instituted extreme travel restrictions, but cases continue to emerge outside of the country. There are now cases reported in 28 countries, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are almost 21,000 cases reported globally and 427 deaths, and the World Health Organization has declared the virus a global public health emergency. Health officials continue to say the threat in Maryland is low. They recommend taking the same precautions as recommended for flu, which includes washing hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick. Also, they have said flu, another unrelated virus, is widespread in Maryland and across the country and it’s not too late to get a flu shot.

Maryland passes 20,000 infections, nears 1,000 deaths from coronavirus
.W
Maryland reported 626 new cases and 71 more deaths from the novel coronavirus Tuesday, pushing the state past 20,000 cases as it draws closer to 1,000 victims of the virus. The additions bring Maryland to 20,113 infections and 929 victims of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The state possibly already has surpassed 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus, with another 87 deaths considered probably caused by the virus, though laboratory tests didn’t confirm those infections. Including negative tests, Maryland added 2,809 test results to its records Tuesday, a steep drop after consecutive days with more than 7,000 results reported as 500,000 tests purchased from South Korea are put to use. Those additional tests have factored into a jump in Maryland’s confirmed cases. Since Friday, the state has seen a 21% increase in confirmed infections. Tuesday ended a five-day string of more than 800 new cases being confirmed each day. Only two days before Thursday had more than 800 new cases. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has said he won’t initiate his plan to reopen the state until there is a 14-day downward trend in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Maryland has yet to have more than two consecutive days with fewer new cases than the prior day. Tuesday’s 71 newly reported deaths make up the state’s second deadliest day due to the virus after Saturday’s 74. One bright spot in the data was only 15 new hospitalization reported Tuesday. Maryland hospitals are currently caring for 1,528 patients confirmed to have the coronavirus, with 551 of those in intensive care, the state reported. Of those infected, 1,295 have been released from isolation, the state said. Nearly 90% of the state’s confirmed deaths are in those at least 60 years old, the age group considered to be most susceptible to the virus. The state announced Monday it would begin to report virus infections and deaths at nursing homes, with several counties reporting that residents of long-term senior care facilities make up a large portion of their COVID-19 deaths. The state had not reported that data as of Tuesday morning. African Americans, who represent about 30% of Maryland’s population, account for about 44% of the state’s cases and virus-related deaths among those whose race was known. Including probable deaths, the plurality of the state’s reported victims of the virus have been white, though Maryland’s white population is double its black population, according to U.S. census data.

Maryland prison system confirms first coronavirus cases
.W
Maryland prison officials confirmed its first cases of the new coronavirus, saying one inmate and two non-correctional contract employees at two different facilities have tested positive for COVID-19. The three victims are associated with correctional facilities in Baltimore and Jessup, officials said. They did not immediately specify which facilities were affected. “The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services has COVID-19 Response Teams working to determine whether any other staff or inmates may have had contact with the three individuals who tested positive,” the system said in a statement. The statement said the department has been deep-cleaning its facilities — including the ones affected — for days and has identified locations and spaces within its facilities for isolation and quarantine. The development follows calls from Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, defense attorneys, medical professionals and others for Gov. Larry Hogan to release certain older, immuno-compromised and parole-eligible prisoners. More than 200 Johns Hopkins University public health faculty and staff penned a letter last week. Mosby’s office reiterated the push for Hogan to establish a plan for reducing prison populations and preventing spread of the virus. In a statement, the office says there needs to be a comprehensive plan on handling prisons and COVID-19. “Today’s news confirming the first coronavirus cases in Maryland prisons underscores that now, more than ever, the Governor must immediately formulate and implement a comprehensive plan for safely handling prisons and COVID-19," a statement reads from Zy Richardson, spokesperson with the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office. "I, along with public health officials, public defenders, and criminal justice experts have provided detailed proposals to Governor Hogan and still stand ready to assist him in any way to prevent the spread. The clock is ticking and we must act now to protect the public’s health.” Hogan said two weeks ago that prisoners were “safer where they are." His office said more recently that they were reviewing the Hopkins letter but said the prison system was taking steps to ensure prisoner safety. Leonard Rubenstein, a program director for the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the confirmation of cases is evidence that the governor needs to take swift action in reducing statewide prisoner populations. If the population stays at the same level, Rubenstein says, the virus will spread at a rapid pace. “These cases underline the urgency for the governor to take action very, very quickly. If people don’t get out, it will spread very quickly and make it difficult to create the space to protect inmates and staff from infection,” Rubenstein said. “We can unfortunately expect rapid spread if the population is not reduced.” Lauren-Brooke Eisen, director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said there needs to be a push across the country for more elderly people with health issues and offenders who are no longer a threat to society to be released. “We are worried about all the people behind bars, especially those 50 or older and those who may have health problems," Eisen said. "We are worried about the deaths that we may start to see behind bars, we know how quickly they spread. "We are urging more released for people across the country.” Earlier Monday, a prison system spokesman said there had been no positive cases within the system, but could not answer whether tests were being administered. It remains unclear how inmates are being tested and screened. Corrections department spokesman Mark Vernarelli said that the system had “canceled visits, modified inmate movements and implemented grab-and-go meals where possible.” “We’re stressing health information and personal hygiene for both employees and inmates and detainees,” Vernarelli continued. “Temperature checks and health questionnaires are being administered to staff at every shift change.” Vernarelli also said that there were “enhanced cleaning procedures” and inmates were being given “extra soap at no cost.” In addition to the cases in the state prison system, an outbreak has been reported at the maximum security Clifton T. Perkins psychiatric hospital, which provides treatment to offenders deemed not criminally responsible or incompetent to stand trial. That facility is run by the Maryland Department of Health, which has not provided any information about the situation. Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3, which represents some of the employees inside the facility, told The Sun said that the outbreak at Perkins was indicative of a larger issue with how the state is handling some essential employees. “We have been warning the administration about this happening for weeks,” Moran said. This article will be updated. Baltimore Sun reporter Phil Davis contributed to this article.

Leimkuhler: Coming to terms with coronavirus
.W
We are in the midst of a global health crisis the likes of which our generation has never seen. Yet, unlike the events of 9/11, when most everyone remembered exactly where they were and what they were doing when terrorists crashed two passenger jets into the twin towers, it’s almost impossible to pinpoint the exact moment the current coronavirus pandemic derailed life as we know it. In late 2019, 17 years after a respiratory virus known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome first appeared in China, reports of a new, yet similar viral illness originating in Wuhan, China began to trickle into the news. The first death associated with this new virus was reported in January. Around the world this news may have initially been met with some measure of detached sympathy and curiosity. We had seen this before. SARS, despite quickly traveling to 29 countries, causing large outbreaks throughout the world, and ultimately causing the death of 774 of the 8,098 infected people, was contained relatively rapidly, caused no deaths in the U.S., and has had no known transmissions since 2004. And so, upon learning about this new virus, the general public may not have felt any real sense of urgency. Rather, many of us may have responded to the news with a collective shrug and simply carried on with our busy lives. Then, in early February, news outlets reported that the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship with more than 3,000 people aboard, had been quarantined in Japan. While the ship was docked in Yokohama, Japan, businessinsider.com reported that the initial 10 cases of the novel coronavirus ballooned to more than 700 over the course of its two-week quarantine, including 44 passengers who were flown back to the U.S. and were required to undergo and additional 14-day quarantine. News of the cruise ship in Japan is what initially caught my attention. My daughter, an Ohio University freshman and a member of the university’s world-renowned marching band, the Marching 110, was slated for a 10-day tour of Japan in May with stops in Kyoto and Tokyo, and a performance in Disneyland. The rapid spread of the virus on the cruise ship gave me the first inkling that the 110’s trip abroad might be in jeopardy. By the end of the month, it was a certainty. On Feb. 27, Japan announced it had closed schools until the end of March and, the next day, Tokyo Disney Resorts reported that it had closed both of its parks due to the coronavirus. I sent my daughter a text with a link to the article on the park closures and asked if there had been any updates regarding the band’s highly anticipated tour. At the time, the tour was still a go, the band directors echoing the naïve hopes and expectations of many: that the situation would likely resolve itself within a few months. Instead, the virus triggered massive outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy, and by Feb. 29 the U.S. had reported its first death on American soil. Five days later, on March 5, Ohio University officially canceled the band’s tour, along with all other international programs, and, from there, the dominoes quickly began to fall. On March 8, some 60 million Italian residents were placed on lockdown. Three days later, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic and President Trump banned travel from 26 European countries. By March 13, the U.S. had declared a national emergency over the novel coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, many colleges had already commenced their spring breaks. By the time Italy was on lockdown, my daughter and three of her friends were already in Florida. Four days into their trip, WHO declared the pandemic and Ohio University instructed students not to return to campus. With the university closed and spring break extended, it made no sense for my daughter to drive back to her Ohio with her friends — all of whom are Ohio residents — so she decided to remain in Florida with her grandparents, who had hosted the group during their spring break. Adding to that decision was the fact that we had a recently purchased a car in Florida that needed to be driven back to Maryland. While some people were ransacking store shelves — panic-buying hand sanitizer and stockpiling toilet paper — I was mulling how best to get my daughter, and the new car, home. Various driving and flying options were considered, but when my own trip to Sedona, Arizona was canceled out of an “abundance of caution” — a phrase which, given the circumstances, has quickly become part of our nation’s vernacular — my schedule was suddenly wide open. For better or worse, and possibly because, like many, we were still operating in a state of denial — we were, after all, still four days away from nearly all U.S. states declaring a State of Emergency — I changed my Southwest reservation from Phoenix to Tampa. When Maryland announced it would be closing its public schools, I booked two additional tickets for my younger daughters and the three of us breezed through a deserted BWI terminal and were among a mere 40 passengers aboard the nearly-empty 175-seat aircraft. Throughout our travels, we bathed in hand gel and wore gloves on the flight as a reminder not to touch our faces or eat with our hands, and arrived in sunny Florida where, it seemed, the majority of residents were oblivious or indifferent to the rapidly evolving health crisis. Editor’s note: This column is the first of three in a series about the coronavirus.

Baltimore County Department of Corrections inmate tests positive for coronavirus
.W
An inmate in the Baltimore County Department of Corrections has tested positive for the coronavirus, county officials announced Friday. The inmate is a black man in his 50s and is in quarantine, though he is not yet exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were 57 confirmed cases of the virus in the Maryland prison system. “Ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of both our professional and dedicated staff and all those at our detention center continues to be our top priority as we navigate this global pandemic,” Baltimore County Department of Corrections Director Gail M. Watts said in a statement. “We will continue to follow the recommendations of federal, state, and local health officials and aggressively adopt public health best practices as we respond to this rapidly evolving crisis.” The Baltimore County Department of Corrections and Department of Health are coordinating to conduct a trace investigation to determine which staff or inmates might have had contact with the infected inmate, who will be monitored in the medical unit for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended period. His housing unit is also under a quarantine protocol, the department said. The department said it has followed CDC guidelines for cleaning facilities and use of personal protective equipment. It’s also worked to ensure that employees feeling ill are sent home, while suspending family and friend visitation for inmates. Of the 57 cases in the state prison system reported Wednesday, 10 were inmates. Maryland also began reporting its overall coronavirus data by race this week. Through Thursday’s case total, 49% of those infected whose race was known were black, though African Americans represent only 30% of Maryland’s overall population, according to U.S. Census data.

Amy Klobuchar’s husband, a University of Baltimore law professor, tests positive for coronavirus
.W
John Bessler, a University of Baltimore law professor and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s husband, has tested positive for the coronavirus, his wife wrote in a Medium post Monday. Bessler, 52, received the results at 7 a.m. Monday, Klobuchar wrote, and is isolated from the senator and their daughter, Abigail. “John started to feel sick when I was in Minnesota and he was in Washington D.C. and like so many others who have had the disease, he thought it was just a cold,” she wrote. “Yet he immediately quarantined himself just in case and stopped going to his job teaching in Baltimore.” Klobuchar wrote his condition stayed poor and that he got tested “when he started coughing up blood.” She wrote he was checked into a hospital in Virginia and “has pneumonia and is oxygen but not a ventilator.” Bessler started teaching at the University of Baltimore’s law school in 2009, a few years after his wife was elected to her first term in the Senate in 2006. He also acted as an adviser to Klobuchar during her unsuccessful campaign for president this year. “While this is his story and not mine, I wanted to let my colleagues and constituents know that since John and I have been in different places for the last two weeks and I am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me not to get a test,” Klobuchar wrote. “I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease,” she continued. The disease has upended life for much of the country, with more than 35,000 confirmed cases and over 400 deaths in the U.S.

Health Department: Six new coronavirus deaths in Carroll County
.W
Six more deaths attributed to the coronavirus have been reported by the Carroll County Health Department, five of them associated with long-term care facilities. In Carroll County, 413 people have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to data released by the Health Department on Monday evening. That’s up by 25 since Friday, 11 of them in Westminster. Carroll has had 53 fatalities. There have been 48 coronavirus deaths of those who live in or work at Carroll living facilities, up from 43 on Friday. Additionally, 243 residents or staff members of such facilities who live in Carroll have tested positive for the disease, up from 235. Seventeen new community cases — that is, not residents or staffers of long-term care facilities — were reported, including one death since Friday, bringing to five the number of community fatalities. The new cases included one person younger than 10 and two older than 80. Of the 170 Carroll countians confirmed to have the virus who are not at a long-term care facility, 83 are women, 87 are men. Two are younger than 10 years old, three are in the 10-19 range; 30 are 20-29 years old; 18 are 30-39; 24 are 40-49; 56 are 50-59; 22 are 60-69; seven are 70-79; and eight are 80-89. There are 27 current hospitalizations of those who have tested positive. Carroll County considers 72 people to be recovered from the disease, up by one since Friday. According to Health Department data, Westminster has the most cases in Carroll, with 178 across two ZIP codes including 11 new cases since Friday, followed by Mount Airy with 116, Sykesville/Eldersburg with 57, Hampstead with 12, Finksburg with 11, Taneytown and Manchester with 10. Data is suppressed in ZIP codes with seven cases or fewer. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

Baltimore water bills delayed due to teleworking complications, coronavirus
.W
Baltimore residents’ water bills are delayed by several weeks because of complications tied to the coronavirus pandemic. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said water billing will resume May 8, and that residents should expect higher than normal bills that include charges for part of March and all of April. He said that new procedures — put in place to allow Department of Public Works staffers to telework and adhere to distancing guidelines — held up the process. “To protect staff from COVID-19, the Department of Public Works put in place a new procedure to enable water billing and customer service staff to telework,” the Democrat said. “This process took a few weeks to put in place.” This is the second time within a year that the city’s water customers have faced a billing disruption. A ransomware attack crippled the city’s computer network last summer. That halted water billing for three months. By the time the system was back up, many households received bills for about $300 to $400. Getting hit with such a large charge was difficult for many low-income households. Young’s administration has pledged to waive late fees as residents deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus that has left thousands unemployed. He reiterated a pledge not to shut off water service if someone doesn’t pay their bill. Young also announced Wednesday a water bill discount program that will begin in May for residents who have lost their jobs during the public health crisis. Starting May 8, eligible residents will receive a 43% discount on charges for water and sewer usage and a waiver for Bay Restoration and Storm Water Remediation fees. The discount is good for one year. Similar discount programs for customers with low incomes typically knock about $40 off a residential bill. Advocates for affordable water thanked the mayor for introducing the program, but said he must go further to protect residents. The city’s existing water assistance program — on which the Emergency COVID-19 Discount is based — requires tenants to have landlords add them to the water account in order to receive help. That’s been a barrier for many residents who rent their homes, advocates say. “Additional support is crucial, as many residents who have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic already received unaffordable water bills,” Rianna Eckel, of Food & Water Action, said in a statement. She urged the administration to take steps to ensure the city’s large population of renters are able to enroll easily in the expanded relief program. The application will be available at cityservices.baltimorecity.gov/BH20 and bmorechildren.com/bh2o.

Baltimore-area Amazon warehouse worker tests positive for the coronavirus
.W
A Baltimore-area Amazon warehouse worker has tested positive for the new coronavirus, a spokesman confirmed Tuesday. Amazon spokesman Timothy Carter confirmed that an employee at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Sparrows Point has tested positive for COVID-19 and wrote in an email that the company is “supporting the individual who is recovering.” “We are following guidelines from health officials and medical experts, and are taking extreme measures to ensure the safety of employees at the site,” Carter wrote. The company maintains a policy where anyone who was in close contact with the diagnosed individual is asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, with pay. Opened at the site of the former Sparrows Point steel mill in eastern Baltimore County, the 855,000-square-foot warehouse opened last year and employs 2,000 people. Amazon fired a worker who organized a walkout at a New York warehouse to demand greater protection against the new coronavirus, saying the employee himself flouted distancing rules and put others at risk. Several Amazon workers walked out of the warehouse, demanding the facility be shut and cleaned during a paid time off after the co-worker tested positive for the virus. About 100 workers were expected to attend the rally, but Amazon said the actual number was much lower. At least 1,660 cases of the disease have been confirmed in Maryland and at least 18 people have died from the virus, according to the state health department. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Big 33 Football Classic canceled due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Big 33 Football Classic, which has been played every year since 1957, has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Scholastic Football Coaches Association-Big33 committee decided that the game could not be held during the 2020 year. All events, including the Big 33 Football Classic, the East West Game, PSFCA High School Combine, USA Football 1st Down Clinic, Military Murph Competition and the Big 33 Fan Experience, were canceled. The classic was scheduled for May 25 at Central Dauphin’s Landis Field at Speed Ebersole Stadium with Maryland’s top high school football stars taking on Pennsylvania’s elite group. “Due to the uncertainty of the weeks ahead with the Coronavirus constraints placed upon each individual, our schools, families, and the organizations and businesses that help make this holiday weekend one of the best in the country, we cannot move forward in holding these events or our exciting football games,” said Big 33 executive director Garry Cathell. “Our top priority is the health, safety and welfare of all of our participants, families, workers, sponsors, and fans.” According to a statement released by Team Marlyand, the players, cheerleaders and buddies will still be honored in some fashion. “We are discussing what we plan to do later this week to honor those selected and unable to play. Overall, it is a huge honor to be selected for the team," the statement read. "To be selected as one of the top 38 players in the state is something our guys have taken very seriously. "Obviously the game weekend itself can’t really be replicated but hopefully we can come up with something. We truly feel bad for every senior in the state who is missing things like prom and graduation. Unfortunately that is just what we all have to deal with now.” A plan will be in place for both teams’ athletes to receive their gear and gifts from the game. Team Maryland is outfitted by Under Armour, while Team Pennsylvania’s gear is from Adidas, but both factories closed because of the ongoing threat of the coronavirus. At a later date, players will be honored on each team’s social media platforms and invited back to other events. Area players, including Mount Saint Joseph’s Marlowe Wax, Tyler Leavy and Aamir Hall, Karon Ball (Towson), Michael Gray (Lake Clifton), St. Frances’ Tyler Thomas, Bryce Johnson-Maith and Jonathan Wallace, Nick Harris (Marriots Ridge), Kamar Missouri (Mervo), Montre Harris (Franklin), Jordan Morant (Milford Mill), Deonte Ferguson (Concordia Prep) and Peter Moore (Calvert Hall), were set to play for Team Maryland. Each Super Bowl has had at least one player who competed in The Big 33 Football Classic.

Maryland Department of Juvenile Services reports first coronavirus case
.W
The Maryland Department of Juvenile Services reported Monday its first positive case of coronavirus in a staff member, state officials confirmed. The department was notified Sunday that a staff member working at the Lower Eastern Shore Children’s Center in Salisbury tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, according to department a news release. The employee last worked at the facility March 27 and has quarantined since then. Staff at Lower Eastern Shore Children’s Center are working with the DJS medical director and state and local health departments to “ensure that all appropriate measures are taken,” the release state. Some of the measures include that all staff and youth are required to wear protective masks. Each youth newly admitted to DJS custody must undergo a medical evaluation during intake and are housed separately until he or she has been monitored for COVID-19 related symptoms and cleared. Those who were in contact with the worker are quarantining, with further tests ordered. Employees who display symptoms or test positive must be medically cleared to return to work, the release states. Facility entry is also being limited to essential personnel, with all persons entering DJS buildings completing a medical screening and temperature check. DJS and the Maryland Department of Education have maintained education services to date, but are planning to transition to a distance learning model, the release states.

Here’s how to reduce your stress over the coronavirus pandemic
.W
Maryland is stressed out by the coronavirus and the social distancing required to slow the outbreak’s spread, according to researchers. But local psychologists say maintaining daily goals and communication with loved ones can reduce pandemic-related anxiety. Maryland so far has 580 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Four deaths have been reported, and 23 patients have been released from isolation. Public services are restricted statewide and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has closed nonessential businesses. Academics are studying the pandemic’s mental impact. A recent poll from the American Psychiatric Association found 48% of Americans are anxious about getting coronavirus. And a February study from King’s College London shows quarantines “can, on occasion, create dramatic effects.” Five psychologists spoke with The Baltimore Sun to explain why the pandemic is stressing us out. They also provided guidance on how to protect your mental health during this time. Pandemics cause anxiety, depression Calling pandemics “an experience out of the ordinary” akin to trauma, Laura Murray, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University Department of International Health, said psychologists are seeing a lot of anxiety and worry among residents. Everyone reacts differently to events, she said, but “there tends to be more fear” as the severity of the pandemic increases. The impact of pandemics and reducing social contacts, according to psychologists, also includes difficulty concentrating or performing well at work or school, fear about infection or the future and irritability. Chetan Joshi, counseling center director for the University of Maryland, College Park, said some people are experiencing varying degrees of panic attacks, depression and even some post traumatic stress disorder-like symptoms. Research also suggests pandemics and quarantines can disrupt sleep, cause changes in appetite, or turn people toward inappropriate coping habits, such as substance use, said Jason Parcover, director of Loyola University Maryland’s counseling center. Nearly four in 10 Americans are anxious about becoming seriously ill or dying from the coronavirus, a national poll shows. And 62% of Americans are anxious about their loved ones getting sick. Health care professionals are also stressed because their work puts themselves and their families at greater risk for infection. Quarantined health care workers worry about causing extra work for their colleagues, Parcover said. Research also suggests health care workers are negatively affected by stigmatizing attitudes from others who may avoid them for fear of infection, he added. Joshi said health care providers’ significant focus on their work is likely keeping them distracted from their own anxiety to an extent. However, Joshi said health care workers face “an extra edge potentially to their anxiety and depression” due to the stress inherent to their work, and frustration, and anger as a result of factors such as the limited availability of personal protective equipment like facial masks. Social distancing could foster loneliness The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise citizens to practice social distancing — stay at home or 6 feet away from others, avoid crowds and don’t touch one another. Social distancing is intended to stop or slow down the spread of coronavirus, but “it’s almost shocking for people because it’s human nature to want to see and literally be able to reach out and touch people,” said clinical psychologist Anita M. Wells, an associate professor in the Department of Psychology at Morgan State University. Wells said social distancing is hard for people right now because we’re used to having the “choice” of seeing people whenever possible, so there’s a “sense of loss, a great sadness” over the current situation. Johannes Thrul, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, urged researchers to monitor loneliness moving forward because he expects those feelings to worsen with increased fear over infections and the economy. Routines can reduce stress The phrase “social distancing” itself potentially elicits feelings of loneliness and hopelessness, Parcover said, so it’s important to stay connected to people virtually. “Just because you are having to stay at home doesn’t mean that you become completely disconnected,” Joshi said. Focusing on things in our control and letting go of things we can’t control will be “critical” in navigating this experience, Joshi said. We can’t control how long this pandemic will last, for instance, but Joshi said we can try to control how we respond to it. Murray urged people to connect with someone daily because someone might be “starting to seclude themselves a little bit more because they are worried or anxious.” People should schedule online dinners via video conferencing as well, Thrul said. “You’re not alone,” Murray said. “Everyone is feeling some degree of worry and anxiety, but these are great things to do to manage.” Creating and focusing on daily schedules helps to address stress, psychologists said. Start the day by writing goals and make an effort to think about three things to be grateful for in life. Doing something new can also combat feelings of monotony, Wells said. She advises people to write down their reflections during this time to acknowledge and understand their feelings. It’s also important to practice daily self-care, such as exercise, meditation or yoga, and even video games. Parcover and Thrul said we should prioritize getting a healthy amount of sleep and eating well. Joshi said “speak up and be an advocate for yourself” if you’re feeling unwell. We should also “keep a sense of hope” and be compassionate with ourselves and others during these stressful times. Limit your media intake and be selective about where you gather your information, as over-consuming news “exacerbates” stress. Murray said consume news three times a day for five to 10 minutes. Thrul said to try to keep your mind off the news cycle during the rest of the day. Last, people can always seek a mental health professional for assistance during the pandemic. Many counselors offer appointments via telephone or video conferencing. “Even though we’re physically distancing, we can still socially encourage and support each other. That’s vital during this time for our mental health and well-being,” Wells said. If you are in an acute mental health crisis, don’t hesitate to contact the 800-273-TALK (8255) lifeline or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor from the crisis text line.

FBI, local Maryland police agencies warn against coronavirus-related scams
.W
The FBI warned Americans to stay watchful of coronavirus-related scams, including fake emails from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, phishing emails advertising testing kits, and masks and people selling counterfeit treatments to the virus. The intelligence agency has seen a rise in scams related to the coronavirus and is encouraging people to look out for emails from senders that claim to be the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other organizations offering information about the virus. Using links in an email, scammers can remotely steal personal information or lock a computer and demand a ransom to reopen it, the agency reported. Nationally, the agency has seen hundreds of COVID-19 fraud cases, and has charged at least two so far outside of Maryland. A federal court in Texas issued a temporary restraining order against a website selling fraudulent coronavirus vaccines, and a southern California man was arrested for soliciting money, claiming it would be used to market a pill that prevents the virus along with an injectable cure, according to two U.S. Attorney’s Offices. The agency does not confirm the existence of investigations as a policy and was unable to supply figures specific to the local area. Some scam emails claim to offer financial assistance as elected officials work in Washington, D.C., to pass an unprecedented economic stimulus bill aimed at helping businesses and providing direct cash payments to Americans financially impacted by the coronavirus. These fake emails ask recipients to verify their personal information to receive a check, which opens them up to theft. “Government agencies are not sending unsolicited emails seeking your private information in order to send you money,” a news release from the FBI states. Those phishing emails can also be related to airline carrier refunds, charitable causes, general financial aid and fake test kits, cures or vaccines, the agency reported. The agency also cautioned against anyone claiming to sell a vaccine or cure for the virus. No vaccine exists, according to the CDC, though many are being tested. Counterfeit protective equipment like masks, gowns, face-shields and gloves also present a danger to purchasers. To date, the Harford County Sheriff’s Office has not received reports of coronavirus-related scams, but cautioned county residents to stay alert and not share their personal information over the internet. “It’s an unfortunate reality that criminals will take advantage of people during a crisis. We encourage Harford County residents to remain vigilant. If it seems to good to be true, it mostly likely is,” the office said. Baltimore County Police Department Director of Public Affairs Vickie Warehime said that there are no known reports of COVID-19 scamming in Baltimore County, but she also clarified that sometimes people do not report scams because they are embarrassed to have fallen for the ploy. She said the Baltimore County Police Department is following the FBI’s lead and encouraged anybody who is the victim to call 911 so they can identify the scam and put a stop to it. "It is best that we know if you are the victim of a scam so we can alert others,” she said. Victims of these internet scams and those wishing to report suspicious activity can also contact the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center. The agency recommends practicing “cyber hygiene” and avoiding attachments and links from unfamiliar senders, verifying the legitimacy of websites visited and not disclosing personal information like social security numbers, financial details usernames or passwords over emails and robocalls, the release states. The coronavirus has sickened at least 774 Marylanders and killed five, according to figures released Friday, and Gov. Larry Hogan said the crisis is still in its early stages with more cases expected in the days to come.

Harford has its first confirmed coronavirus death, Glassman announces
.W
Harford County Executive Barry Glassman confirmed the county’s first coronavirus-related death Friday. The person who died was 27-years-old male with underlying medical conditions, Glassman said in his weekly emailed update on the county’s response to the virus. . The man died April 13 and he was posthumously diagnosed with COVID-19 by the medical examiner. The Maryland Department of Health also listed six “probable” coronavirus-related deaths in Harford on its website. A probable case means that COVID-19 has been listed as the cause of death on a person’s death certificate, but it had not yet been verified by a positive test. It’s unclear if the confirmed death is among the six probable ones announced earlier Friday. As of Friday, Maryland reported over 11,000 confirmed cases of the virus, including 176 in Harford County. There have been 425 confirmed deaths associated with the virus across the state. In response to the growing threat, Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order Wednesday that mandates use of cloth masks or face coverings on public transportation and in stores by 7 a.m. Saturday. The order, Glassman clarifies, does not require citizens to use N95 masks, which should be reserved for first responders and medical personnel. Guidance on how to make and wear a homemade cloth mask is available on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website. Harford County also began receiving a shipment of personal protective equipment meant to supply its first responders, Glassman said. The county ordered 100,000 N95 masks, 500,000 surgical masks and 100,000 gowns to ensure the safety of police, fire and EMS personnel. Glassman exhorted people to stay safe and continue efforts to slow the virus’ spread. CORRECTION: Due to incorrect information received from Harford County Government, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated the travel history for the 27-year-old Harford resident who died of coronavirus.

My son and the coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
My son lives in China, where he teaches at an international school in Shenzhen, so I have been getting daily reports about the coronavirus outbreak in the region. Early last week, he was preparing for a long-planned hiking trip in a mountainous area in southwestern China to visit Tiger Leaping Gorge. His trip was paid for, and he was packed and ready to leave Wednesday for his Lunar New Year school holiday. As the coronavirus news broke last Monday, he called and said he was thinking about cancelling his trip. It would entail many hours of travel on crowded trains and he might contract the virus in such close quarters. Like any mother would do, I told him not to go — without hesitation. He was over 8,000 miles away, and there wasn’t much I could do except talk to him by phone and report news that he might not have access to in China. Despite being in the midst of a fast-growing viral epidemic, he wasn’t convinced of the risk that day. I trusted, or at least hoped, that he would come around, but his lifelong pattern of independence was not in my favor in this debate. At a young age, he put himself to bed with no assistance. After college, he took a job teaching high school on a tropical French Island, Reunion, that is surrounded by shark-infested waters off the coast of Africa. He moved on after that to a teaching gig at a college in Ecuador before the latest gig in China teaching kindergarten and first grade. During school holidays, he visits as many countries as he can, which my collection of post cards can attest. He has traveled so much he had to add extra pages to his passport. So he was determined to go on this trip and went shopping to get face masks, hand sanitizer, bottled water and food. The usually busy streets were not too crowded. Many stores and restaurants were closing, and hand sanitizer and soap were nowwhere to be found — sold out everywhere. To think, he used to laugh at my husband’s carefully stocked emergency supply kit of water, flashlights, peanut butter and powdered milk that lives in the laundry room, perched on top of a spare refrigerator. We video chatted as he shopped, and since face masks are de rigueur, his face was mostly covered during the call. I sent him an online photo that showed a man in a face mask with a lit cigarette poking through a hole in the middle. The real public health issue that needs to be addressed, he contended, is spitting, a nasty habit outlawed in Hong Kong but not where he lives in mainland China. That, and the sale of bushmeat in the markets, has fueled the spread of this virus, my son was convinced. (Spitting was outlawed in Baltimore in the late 1800s to help prevent the spread of tuberculosis). Later that day, the news broke about the quarantining of Wuhan, ground zero for the virus. My son finally came to his senses. This worried mother breathed a sigh of relief. Wisely, he canceled his trip. A few days later, more Chinese cities were closed to travel, and Hong Kong canceled schools for a month. My son’s school did the same. A friend sent him a photo of Corona beers with a message that said his refrigerator was infected with the corona virus. As more and more case reports emerged about the spread of the virus to other cities and countries, we talked by phone multiple times a day. I was a nervous wreck, a worried mom. How long would it be before the epidemic peaked? How far and how fast would it spread? Was it advisable for him to stay in Shenzhen for a month until schools opened, and would he even be able to get out of China now? Lucky for my anxious heart, my son decided to decamp as quickly as he could. It took two days of an “apocalyptic nightmare," as he described it, to get a visa to Sri Lanka and a flight out of China.

Maryland reports 723 coronavirus deaths, 879 new cases
.W
Maryland health department officials reported 723 total deaths Friday and 879 new cases of the coronavirus, a slight decrease in the the number of cases added the day before. The state added 43 confirmed deaths over the last 24 hours. Another 75 deaths were listed as probably caused by COVID-19 but not confirmed by a laboratory test. Maryland has yet to see more than two consecutive days in which the number of new cases was lower than the day before. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has said he will start to make decisions about reopening the state’s economy after new cases decrease 14 days in a row. About 141 more people have been hospitalized for complications related to COVID-19 since Thursday, the state reported, bringing the number of beds occupied to about 1,400 and total hospitalizations over time to 3,618. At about this time last month, only 108 hospital beds were occupied due to the coronavirus, an increase of over 1000%. The state also reported more total cases in the 20-29 age group than those over 80, though the latter group outpaces the former in confirmed fatalities. Black Marylanders, meanwhile, continue to outnumber other reported racial and ethnic groups in total cases, with over 6,000 of the state’s 16,616 cases, which equates to about 36%. Black and white Maryland residents have about the same number of total related deaths — with 289 and 275, respectively — though black Marylanders make up a smaller portion of the state’s overall population. Prince George’s County continues to lead all other jurisdictions in total case count. ZIP code 20783, in Prince Goerge’s, surpassing Baltimore City’s 21215.

Proud of Maryland’s coronavirus response | READER COMMENTARY
.W
We were in Australia when the world first heard of COVID-19 in December, and then we went to Hawaii before landing back in Baltimore in late February. After being in so many different places and seeing how governments and local officials handled this virus, I am so proud of our governor and how our Maryland officials have handled this (“Maryland Gov. Hogan announces closure of nonessential businesses due to coronavirus pandemic,” March 23). It is unfortunate that we cannot always trust what our government officials say here in the United States and the world, but in Maryland we can. And it makes me extremely proud to be from Maryland.

Fourth Harford sheriff’s deputy tests positive for coronavirus
.W
A fourth Harford County Sheriff’s deputy has tested positive for coronavirus, the office announced Tuesday. The deputy was working in the Investigative Services Bureau temporarily, sheriff’s office spokesperson Cristie Hopkins said. He was not working in the same building as the previous three positive cases, and his assignment required minimal, “if any,” interaction with the public, Hopkins said. He had been out of the workplace since April 4. “Appropriate measures to sanitize the office building are currently underway,” Hopkins said. Three other sheriff’s office personnel tested positive for the virus — the first being a supervisor in the Investigative Services Bureau, which the office confirmed Friday, and two detectives in the unit, whose tests returned positive on Monday. Six other sheriff’s office employees have been tested, one of those tests came back negative on Monday, Hopkins said. The office is still awaiting results of the five other tests. Currently, 44% of the office’s civilian personnel are teleworking, Hopkins said. This story may be updated.

GBMC discharges first coronavirus patient who was on ventilator
.W
The Greater Baltimore Medical Center discharged its first coronavirus patient Wednesday who required being hooked up to a ventilator. In a video message, GBMC President and CEO John B. Chessare said the hospital was “pausing for a moment of celebration.” The president said in the video that the emergency department has not seen an increase in the number of patients with respiratory symptoms. Currently the hospital is treating nine patients who tested positive for COVID-19, Chessare said in the video, and is awaiting tests for an additional 25-30 people who are experiencing respiratory symptoms. Maryland reported nearly 2,000 positive coronavirus tests Wednesday, a 20% day-to-day increase. The death toll also rose to 31 people. “I want to assure you that GBMC is not letting down its guard down,” Chessare said. “If there is a significant surge of COVID-19 patients over the next couple of weeks, we will be ready.” The hospital president thanked those working in the hospital, including the nurses and doctors. He also thanked the community for its unwavering support. “When our doctors and nurses know the community has their back, it boosts up their morale and makes them want to serve even more,” he said.

Second case of coronavirus announced in Carroll County
.W
A family member of the first man found with the coronavirus in Carroll County has contracted the disease, according to the county health department. The second Carroll countian with the coronavirus, known by the disease it causes, COVID-19, is a woman in her 30s with mild symptoms, a Tuesday morning news release from the Carroll County Health Department states. She is in good condition and is recovering at home. The first Carroll case, a man in his 40s, was announced Friday afternoon. The health department is not releasing where in the county the two people have traveled, citing a need to protect their identities. “We are very grateful that Carroll County’s first two cases are experiencing extremely mild illness and are being very cooperative with public health guidelines,” Ed Singer, Carroll County health officer, says in the release. The health department is investigating these cases with the help of the Maryland Department of Health, the release reads. Communicable disease nurses will identify people who had contact with the patients and advise them of any actions to take. The health department will share information, as soon as possible, if any risk to the public is identified. “We know people all across the county and the country are being asked to adhere to sweeping restrictions on their activity,” Stephen Wantz, president of the Board of County Commissioners, said in the release. “We appreciate everyone’s cooperation as we believe this social distancing is critical to saving lives in our community.” Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. At least 57 people have confirmed COVID-19 infections in the state as of Tuesday morning, according to Mike Ricci, spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan, though the second Carroll case was not included in that total. In following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hogan declared Monday that gatherings of 50 people or more should be postponed or cancelled. He also ordered nonessential businesses such as bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to close. As of Tuesday evening, the coronavirus had resulted in at least 97 deaths in the United States out of about 5,900 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic March 11. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

The Baltimore City Sheriff’s Office confirmed Wednesday that two deputies have tested positive for coronavirus. Maj. Sabrina Tapp-Harper said the deputies work in the unit that serves evictions, though that work has been on hold with evictions halted due to coronavirus. Tapp-Harper said the deputies were assigned to an office in the Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse, formerly known as Courthouse East, and that the facilities will receive a deep cleaning. Tapp-Harper said services would not be disrupted, although it likely result in services involving other actions, including protective orders, being relocated to the Clarence Mitchell Courthouse. Tapp-Harper said nine additional deputies have been placed on quarantine as a precaution. The deputies who tested positive reported having family members that were determined to have COVID-19, but returned to work until they came down with symptoms themselves, Tapp-Harper said.

Maryland casinos see their revenues plummet in March amid coronavirus
.W
Revenues at the state’s six casinos plunged by more than half last month compared to a year ago after they were closed as part of the effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency said Friday. Casinos were closed on March 16 as part of a series of mandates by Gov. Larry Hogan that shuttered eat-in restaurants, shopping malls, gyms, movie theaters and other gathering places. Last month’s casino revenues were down almost 58 percent compared to March 2019, a drop of $94.6 million according to the agency. Total revenues for the six casinos for March were $68.7 million, officials said. Lottery sales also were down about 30 percent, said Gordon Medenica, director of the agency. “Bars and restaurants, which are closed under the current directive, account for about 15% of our retailers,” Medenica said in a statement. "People simply are staying home, as they should, and not playing as much.” The drop in gaming revenues comes a year after the state’s casinos hit their single-month record, generating $163.2 million last March, Maryland Lottery and Gaming said. The Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore recorded the largest decrease, more than 61 percent compared to the prior March, while Live Casino & Hotel in Anne Arundel County had the smallest, less than 56 percent. The casinos contributed nearly $28.3 million to the state in March, including $21.2 million to the Education Trust Fund, the agency said. By comparison, casino revenues totaled $151.3 million in February, a more than 10 percent increase over the previous February. The casinos contributed $62.9 million to the state, including $47.2 million for the education fund.

Archdiocese of Baltimore, Episcopal bishops release coronavirus reopening guidelines
.W
The Archdiocese of Baltimore has provided a plan to reopen its parishes after in-person gatherings have been canceled during the coronavirus pandemic. The Catholic church will institute a phased-in approach, Archbishop William E. Lori wrote in a news release Sunday, informed by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s three-stage plan to reopen the state. The first step of the church’s plan will be reopening churches for private prayer, with the number of people allowed to gather limited to three and the enforcement of social distancing guidelines. Confessions, weddings, funerals and baptisms will resume during this stage, with continued limits on the number of people present. In the second step, public Masses will “most likely” resume, with limitations on gatherings and changes to the service due to social distancing guidelines. The obligation to attend Mass will initially be suspended for those who are sick, vulnerable to COVID-19 or uncomfortable joining. Lori wrote that while he believes the first phase of the plan can be implemented “relatively soon,” he does not have a timeline. Maryland has yet to enter the first stage of its reopening, which would allow religious institutions to offer “limited attendance” at outdoor worship. The Episcopal dioceses are taking a similar approach. The bishops of Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., pledged to coordinate their reopening efforts as the political leaders of the region have been doing, and announced a phased reopening plan for when services are allowed to resume. “The hard truth is that we will not be able to welcome all people into our places of worship for the foreseeable future,” the bishops wrote in the announcement. “Thus we must prepare for different stages of regathering, following the guidelines of civic leaders. "Moreover, the process of regathering may not be uniform, but vary according to county or region, and we must also prepare for the possibility of suspending in-person gatherings again should cases of infection rise.” Phase one, while stay-at-home orders and other crowd restrictions are in place, consists of virtual worship, bible study and other activities. When case numbers, hospitalizations and intensive care cases have declined for two weeks and significantly limited gatherings are allowed, phase two will accommodate “small indoor church worship," while maintaining social distance and limiting attendees. As cases “near zero," businesses reopen and governments relax restrictions, phase four will allow for more people to worship together and larger group ministries, including youth groups, camps and classes, to resume. But “restrictive practices may still guide the celebration of Eucharist,” the bishops said. Once a vaccine is available to the general public and treatments have been proven effective, phase four will lift the remaining restrictions and allow an unlimited number of worshipers to attend services, “except ... those who are known to be infectious, actively sick or who display any of the symptoms of being ill," the bishops said.

Baltimore losing $20 million per month under coronavirus restrictions
.W
Baltimore is losing $20 million per month in revenue under social distancing restrictions that have shuttered businesses and forced people out of work to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, city officials said Friday. The revenue loss is a combination of reduced income taxes as city residents have lost their jobs, falling tourism revenue, hurt by a lack of visitors during the outbreak, and declining highway user funds from people not gassing up their cars. About a third of the city’s general fund revenue, which it relies on to cover expenses, is “significantly at risk” because of the pandemic, said Bob Cenname, Baltimore’s budget director. City officials released new details about the revenue shortfall as they prepare to close fiscal year 2020 and pass a budget for fiscal year 2021, which begins July 1. Baltimore officials previously announced the city expects to face a $42 million deficit for the current fiscal year as a result of the virus, which had killed more than 723 Marylanders as of Friday and sickened about 16,600. Maryland has been under a stay-at-home order for nearly a month in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, and nonessential businesses have been closed since mid-March. Of the city’s revenue streams hurt the worst, tourism, which includes hotel taxes, convention center fees and some parking meter funds, are the most “at risk,” Cenname said. “We’re not seeing small declines on those sources. We’re seeing almost zero [revenue],” he said. Compounding the revenue losses are increased expenses for coronavirus-related purchases including masks and gloves for front-line workers. So far, the city has spent about $20 million in coronavirus-related expenses, said Henry Raymond, Baltimore’s chief financial officer. That figure will likely increase to $45 million to $48 million by June 30, he said. Baltimore officials expect to be reimbursed for those coronavirus-related expenses by federal stabilization funds being distributed to municipalities across the United States. Henry said he believes the stabilization funds will cover the $20 million spent so far. City officials do not believe, however, the stabilization funds will cover all revenue losses caused during the virus, Cenname and Henry cautioned. Baltimore will have to make up that difference elsewhere, likely from city’s rainy day fund. The city has $145 million in the fund at present. “The rainy day fund exists because it’s a backstop for a situation like this,” Cenname said. “It’s very likely, almost certain we’ll have to tap the rainy day fund for those lost revenues.” Democratic City Council President Brandon Scott has called for the city to use $25 million from its rainy day fund to support small businesses, laid-off workers and homeless people as they cope with the fallout. Scott is running against incumbent Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young this year. Baltimore’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 anticipates a $103 million shortage in revenue based on the assumption that serious restrictions on movement and gathering due to the virus could remain in place through September. If the city’s situation remains the same after that or worsens, finance officials would have to increase that expected shortfall, Cenname said. To address some of that shortage, Young has submitted several proposals to the unions representing Baltimore’s workforce including furloughs, pay cuts and layoffs. Young’s spokesman said Friday the mayor wants to avoid layoffs. The administration has been having “productive discussions” with union leaders, he said. Sgt. Mike Mancuso, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said Friday he has had no discussions with city administrators since the various options were suggested to city unions the second week of April. “I imagine they are with the unions that are not front-line. Their people are getting full salaries to stay home and work or not work and FOP and Fire are getting COVID-19,” he said, adding that nearly 30 police officers have tested positive for the virus. Earlier this week, The Washington Post reported that major metropolises including Baltimore; Austin, Texas, Boston and Detroit may struggle to access a $500 billion emergency lending program offered by the Federal Reserve in an effort to shore up local government budgets. The story said cities with fewer than a million residents would not qualify. Baltimore has fewer than 600,000 residents, according to recent census estimates. Davis said Friday there are "no anticipated concerns or problems at all” with getting money from the federal government to assist with the pandemic. Baltimore will be seeking assistance directly from federal officials not from the state, he said. Baltimore Sun reporter Jessica Anderson contributed to this article.

Three new cases of coronavirus confirmed in Howard County
.W
Howard County confirmed three new cases of coronavirus mid-day Monday, bringing the countywide total to four. The cases are a man in his 40s who is on dialysis in the hospital, a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions who is self-isolating at home and a woman in her 70s who also is self-isolating at home, according to the county. The three new Howard cases would bring the statewide total to 40 as of Monday. The first case of coronavirus in Howard was reported Sunday, an 82-year-old woman with underlying health conditions who is a resident at Lorien Health Services’ Elkridge facility. She is being treated at a hospital, though Howard County could not confirm which one. During transport of that first patient, six Howard County emergency responders were exposed, according to acting Fire Chief Bill Anuszewski. “All providers have been contacted, are self-quarantining and are in relatively good spirits consider the circumstances,” Anuszewski said. On Sunday, when County Executive Calvin Ball announced the first case, he also signed a state of emergency mandating social distancing measures including closing The Mall in Columbia, the shops at Savage Mill and the county’s movie theaters. On Monday, Gov. Larry Hogan took that one step further and announced that restaurants, bars and gyms would close statewide beginning at 5 p.m. Grocery stores, banks, pharmacies and other essential services will remain open. While closing restaurants, Hogan’s order permits drive-thru, carryout and food delivery service. “We need to remain vigilant, but calm, and continue practicing social distancing,” Ball said in a statement Monday. “We will only be successful in slowing this virus if we work together.”

Impeachment not a good excuse for slow coronavirus response | COMMENTARY
.W
A reporter asked President Donald Trump this week what he thought of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s claim that impeachment distracted Mr. Trump from tackling the coronavirus epidemic earlier. The president gave a rambling answer but ultimately settled on a firm no. “I don’t think I would have done better had I not been impeached, OK?” Mr. Trump said. “And I think that’s a great tribute to something. Maybe it’s a tribute to me. But I don’t think I would’ve acted any differently or I don’t think I would’ve acted any faster.” Mr. Trump’s response threw cold water on what was becoming a common talking point on the right. A week earlier, Henry Olsen, a very Trump-sympathetic columnist for the Washington Post, had written a column headlined, “Let’s be honest. Impeachment hurt Mr. Trump’s response to coronavirus.” As China was locking down its cities, Mr. Olsen argued, “the White House was focused on addressing this threat to its survival, not on preparing for a threat from China that might never even materialize.” Other conservatives, including my friends and former National Review colleagues Rich Lowry and Dan McLaughlin, made similar arguments. They emphasized how fortunate we are, in retrospect, that Republicans refused to allow witnesses at the trial, or the distraction might have lasted well into February. As a matter of analysis, this argument is plausible, perhaps even probable. As Mr. Trump repeatedly reminds us, he made a tough and controversial decision to curtail travel from China early on. That was the right thing to do. But it was only a wise decision because it bought us time to marshal resources to fight the inevitable outbreak here in the states. Then, the administration didn’t use that time wisely and failed to adequately prepare. Consider that both South Korea and the United States recorded their first confirmed case on Jan. 20. South Korea immediately went into overdrive with testing, social distancing and contact tracing. The U.S. did not. The fact that South Korea has the pandemic under relative control and the U.S. doesn’t speaks volumes. But the White House insists that the president always took the threat seriously. "I don't believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus," Vice President Mike Pence said this week, despite countless examples of the president belittling the threat of the coronavirus. Politically, it’s smart for Mr. McConnell to blame impeachment. He’s chiefly interested in his own re-election and protecting the Republican majority in the Senate. But Mr. Trump’s calculation is different. Both psychologically and politically, he thinks admitting error is a profound mistake. Admitting he took his eye off the ball because of impeachment might not go over well with the non-base voters he needs to get re-elected. Hence the talking point that he’s done everything right from day one. My problem with the pin-it-on-impeachment argument is twofold. First, it confuses the difference between an explanation and an excuse. If I tell you that I robbed a liquor store because I wanted the money to buy a new car, that's an explanation, not an excuse. If I did it because kidnappers threatened to harm my family, that's an excuse. For people who think there was no merit whatsoever to the impeachment of Mr. Trump, and that whatever mistakes he made in his response to the coronavirus were because of it, blaming the Democrats makes some sense. But that raises my second objection. Whether or not you think the president should have been impeached or removed, Mr. Trump is not simply a victim. As Ramesh Ponnuru (also of National Review) notes, this attempt to shift the blame “implicitly treats Democratic behavior as the variable and Republican behavior as the constant.” Some Democrats have always wanted to impeach Mr. Trump simply because they can’t stand him. But others — most importantly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — resisted such efforts by the bomb-throwers. Then, Mr. Trump did something — chiefly, he pressured Ukraine to muddy up presidential candidate Joe Biden — and that changed the equation. If impeaching the president is a bad idea because it might distract him from a crisis like the one we're now in, behaving in a way that might invite impeachment is a bad idea, too. In other words, there are no constants here. All the players are dependent variables playing off each other. So many of the arguments marshalled to defend Mr. Trump take it as a given that he can’t change, so everyone else should accommodate him, and if they don’t, they’re to blame for his irrational response. He’s like the cantankerous uncle who comes to Thanksgiving dinner. He won’t change, so there’s no point in getting mad at his behavior. Instead, you get mad at the nephew who sets him off: “You should have known better!” Maybe that's true of the nephew, but it's no less true of the uncle.

Harford County Sheriff’s deputy tests positive for coronavirus
.W
The Harford County Sheriff’s Office announced Friday that a deputy has tested positive for the novel coronavirus sweeping through Maryland. In a statement posted to the office’s Facebook page, Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler said the deputy was a supervisor assigned to the Investigative Services Bureau and had been non-symptomatic when he was last in the workplace on March 26. Sheriff’s office spokeswoman Cristie Hopkins said that the the deputy spent minimal time working with the public. The office declined to release more identifying information about the deputy. The office will now begin tracking and informing those who the deputy had contact with and could have been exposed to the virus, in accordance with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, to curtail its spread. The deputy is feeling better and is expected to make a full recovery, Gahler said in the statement. The possibility of the virus’ transmission to the sheriff’s office was not unexpected, according to the statement. “While a positive test result within our ranks was anticipated, it is no less concerning,” Gahler said. “Once again, I want to recognize the courageousness and selflessness of our Agency members, and everyone on the front line, providing public safety in our County in the face of this threat.” Gahler said Harford County residents should not hesitate to call 911 in the event of an emergency or to report a crime. The office has set up a telephone reporting unit that takes reports of crimes over the phone without any physical contact with county residents, according to the statement. Deputies are also equipped with personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves and eye protection. “Please stay safe and stay home. We are all in this together,” Gahler wrote. There are 41 confirmed cases of the virus in Harford County as of Friday morning and over 2,700 in the state, the number of which has exponentially increased since the first cases were reported on March 4, according to data from the Maryland Department of Health.

.W
Two screening officers at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport tested positive for the coronavirus and are at home resting, according to a spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA officers last worked at the airport more than 14 days ago, spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said late Saturday. Farbstein said she was unable to provide additional information Saturday night. It remains unknown whether additional airport workers are being tested or quarantined. The coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 disease it causes, has infected more than 1,000 people across Maryland and killed 10 of them, according to figures released Saturday by the state health department. The TSA formed a website to track cases that arise at American airports. Cases are only listed on the map for which an officer tests positive within 14 days. After 14 days, the case is removed from the map. Visit the map at www.tsa.gov/coronavirus.

Baltimore-area summer camps facing uncertainty due to coronavirus
.W
For some Baltimore-area children, summers are consumed with the carefree days of summer camp activities like swimming, singing songs, perfecting a lacrosse pass, making crafts and sharing snowballs with newfound friends. But the uncertainty of coronavirus has forced organizers around Maryland to re-evaluate what camp will look like, if they are able to hold it. And some others are already canceling some activities. Y in Central Maryland CEO John Hoey said his organization is making contingency plans should its camp schedule need to eventually be altered. “We are not just waiting, we are doing a lot of work to prepare for what will be a very different camp than I think any of us have ever experienced,” Hoey said. One of the differences will be monitoring the health of the campers. “We are going to be ready, we certainly know that there will be significant health restrictions that we will be prepared to deal with,” he said. “We know that there are going to be fewer kids, even though I think clearly everybody who has kids at home would love for their kids to be going to camp this summer. But certain parents are going to be very careful about that and they are going to not want that.” Hoey is also aware that the lack of person-to-person contact learning for children because Maryland schools have been closed since March 16. Schools will not reopen before May 18, if at all for the remainder of the school year. “We also recognize that while summer camp is going to be and needs to be about fun for the kids, there is going to be a segment of parents who feel that they will want a little more academic enrichment and we’ve always had in our camps enrichment activities interspersed, so we are looking at ways to maybe amp that up a little bit without having it overtake camp,” he said. “I always say the trick is to have learning opportunities for kids while they are not realizing that they are learning.” Hoey has seen the effect it has had on summer camps at the 17 Y camps in five counties (Baltimore, Howard, Anne Arundel, Harford and Carroll) and Baltimore City. “Before this whole situation resulted in the shutdown, our registration levels were as high as they have ever been and people have continued to register, but obviously at a much slower rate,” Hoey said. “If we can’t deliver camp for the week they registered they will get a full refund, so nobody is really putting any money at risk.” While the Y camps and many other local organizations are continuing to accept registration, other camps — like the UMBC Summer Day Camp — have already canceled sessions. The first three weeks of the UMBC camp, scheduled to take place between June 15 and July 2, will not be held and a refund plan is being developed for those families who have already made payments. The downturn in the economy which has left many families struggling financially is also a concern, Hoey said. “The other issue is, sadly, the unemployment rate is skyrocketing, so there are people who are not going to be working, so they may decide against it,” Hoey said. “We are not for-profit, so we raise money to try to get everybody into camp, but we know that the need is going to be much higher than it ever has been, so we are actually working hard on raising money to fund people who couldn’t otherwise afford it.” There are three Y camps in Howard County:Camp Ilchester, the Y in Ellicott City (Dancel) and St. John’s Parish Day School. The tenuous situation extends to camps of all shapes and sizes, with plenty of camps not affiliated with the Y of Central Maryland facing similar obstacles. In Howard County, that includes a multitude of camps associated with the Columbia Association and Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks. Amid the uncertainty, these organizations are holding out hope that camps might be able to be held in some capacity. Along those lines, registration largely remains open. The Columbia Association, for example, is accepting registrations for camps in June, July and August despite the organization itself currently being closed and no reopening date set. “It is too early to make decisions as the situation is rather fluid. If we are not open by the first week of June, the camps that operate in June will be cancelled,” said Paul Gleichauf, CA interim chief marketing officer. Gleichauf added the Columbia Association reopening is directly subject to the “determinations of the governor and his public health officials.” “CA leadership continues to plan for re-opening under a range of potential scenarios driven by length of closure and the possibility that some facilities and programs may be permitted to re-open sooner than others.” Howard County is operating under a similar mindset, as Marketing and Public Information Superintendent Anna Hunter said the rec and parks department is “still planning for and taking registration for summer camps.” The Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks has currently cancelled all programs and events through May 15 and will be reassessing the need to extend that date when it gets closer. Both the CA and rec and parks have said that should camps be forced to cancel because of the coronavirus, registrants will be able to receive a refund. In the case of the Department of Recreation and Parks, an option would also be available to apply the registration fee as a credit toward a future camp or league. Sport-specific camps are not immune to the uncertainty either. In Harford County, one of the oldest sports camps in the Baltimore area — the Harford Lacrosse Camp — is hoping to hold its 40th camp at Rocks State Park. The camp, started in 1981 by Harford lacrosse legends John Grubb and Frank Mezzanotte, began as a boys only camp. It has since added a girls camp and this year, for the first time, a camp for younger boys only. Co-directors Grubb and Mezzanotte still run the camps along with co-director Jason Bellamy, who joined forces with them a few years ago. “So, right now, we’re just waiting to see. We’re waiting to see the directives from the governor, all the way down to the facilities that we are running camps in,” Bellamy said. “Once we clear any of those hurdles, we’d have to make our own decisions on the safety of what we are able to offer student athletes.” The camp for younger boys, grades three through eight, is scheduled for July 6 to 10 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at The Arena Club. The overall boys camp at the Rocks State Park 4-H Facility, is set for July 13-16 for boys entering grade one through 12. “Last year we had over 200 kids here,” Bellamy said. The girls camp, also at the 4-H facility, is set for July 20 to 23 and is for girls in grade one to 12. Both camps have options for campers. They can do a short-day program, a long-day program or there’s an overnight option. “Our registration is open on our website. When schools closed in middle of March, we removed the requirement of paying a deposit, so now you can register without paying a deposit,” Bellamy said. Bellamy said they will continue to work to get plans in place. Thought is on their end, that they can go to the last minute. “It’s really just staffing, letting our staff know whether we’re gonna do it or not. Other than that, we’ll have all the tools and things that we need to run the camp with, whether we have it this year or not,” Bellamy said. “We can probably go pretty late on the decision. It’s just going to be the governor’s decisions and the two facilities that we run the camp at. Their timelines and those things.” Big picture, Hoey and fellow directors expressed a similar sentiment — they would like nothing better than seeing kids having fun again at various camps. “Kids are cooped up, we want them out, kids need to be active, we all know that and while as parents we are all trying to keep our kids active, it’s just harder,” Hoey said. “I always say plan for the worst, hope for the best.” Baltimore Sun Media reporters Brent Kennedy and Randy McRoberts contributed to this article.

Maryland life amid coronavirus: reader stories | COMMENTARY
.W
Weeks into a stay-at-home order from Gov. Larry Hogan to prevent the spread of COVID-19, many of us are getting more used to the idea of only going out when it is important. More people are wearing masks, and streets are emptier than ever. People have also lost their jobs and wonder how they will feed their families and pay bills. It hasn’t been an easy time, and many of us are itching to get back to the way things were, but this may be the new normal for the foreseeable future. We have all found our ways to cope and bright spots in such a dark period. We’ve asked readers to share their stories of how life has changed and how they are coping in 450 words or less. They’ve been lightly edited for length and clarity, and more can be found online at baltimoresun.com/opinion. Submit your own at talkback@baltimoresun.com, with the subject line “coronavirus story.” We’ll edit and compile our favorites for later publication in The Sun and share them with the Maryland Historical Society for potential inclusion in their “Collecting in Quarantine” initiative to preserve for future generations how Marylanders are living through this unique moment in history. A virtual dance school When Gov. Hogan initially announced that schools were closing, my two main concerns were how to continue to teach ballet, tap and hip-hop ensemble and still interact on a daily basis with the beautiful students and families that come to the Maryland Academy of Dance. And how to ensure that my team of instructors and other staff could continue to earn steady incomes in what had become the new stay-at-home normal. Empathy, honesty and integrity lead my decisions. I tried to take into account all view points and do what was best for our school, teachers and families. I simply had to keep business going during this pandemic. That meant turning into a virtual dance school. My administrative team and I immediately sprung into action to transition our two buildings, which includes seven dance studios, 375 students and 17 teachers, into one virtual training facility — all within just two days. By the time Monday classes began at 5:30 p.m., March 16, we were officially The Virtual Maryland Academy of Dance. We set up our classes through the Zoom app, which every family has downloaded and is able to use for live instruction. Not only have we been able to keep the business alive, but we understand now more than ever that seeing familiar faces and connecting with other people is good for the soul and everyone’s well-being. Listening to the kids socialize before class or brighten up when they see familiar faces on their screens has been priceless. In the nine dance seasons we have been in business, the academy has truly become a family. Not being able to see one another was going to take a toll on all of us. Seeing how important that social aspect was, we’ve added other activities in addition to dance instruction to keep the camaraderie the school was known for and encourage our families to continue to interact with us and one another. Through our virtual classroom portals, website and social media pages we have implemented dance challenges and movie nights, where we all get together on Saturday nights to log on as a virtual family and watch the same movie. There are also opportunities for students to have one-on-one chats with the director and access free online dance videos, classes, memberships and other fun activities that can be implemented into their daily home-schooling curriculum. As we move into the next realm of the quarantine, the students continue to be dedicated to their craft and eager to learn. We will continue to adjust to this new normal and enjoy and appreciate the simple things that keep us connected. Darby Iva Pack, director of Maryland Academy of Dance in Baltimore County Faith and resilience in pandemic job loss and work injury Our story has been about resilience. I, my wife and five kids have to be strong, creative and have faith to not let our minds become idle during this pandemic. We manage by organizing egg hunts, educational hangman games, reading time, school work, family movie time, dancing and arts and crafts projects. Keeping the kids active and positive helps keeps us as parents active and positive as well. But it is sometimes hard as I deal with a shoulder injury I suffered on the job. My wife was laid off from her job as an EMT so she isn’t working. It can be stressful to think about the financial hardship we face while trying to take care of five kids. We have turned to faith in our home and resilience. We rely on food banks to feed our family. We thank these organizations greatly for their help. Life has definitely changed in other ways as well. We can’t imagine going out in this world every day without mask, gloves and hand sanitizer — just like we carry a wallet. There are no more high-fives or hugs when we see friends and family in public. No Sunday dinners with extended family, church, date nights or weekend parties. Malls and shopping centers are closed. It feels like we are living in a science fiction movie. But it’s reality. But we are resilient and we will get through and overcome and surpass this pandemic called COVID-19. Orlando Barnes, Columbia From tennis to trash walks I am a 76-year-old woman who, prior to the COVID-19, found exercise on a tennis court. Now I take daily “trash walks” for exercise and a sense of purpose. Equipped with a face mask, gloves, a large plastic bag and a grabber (a helpful device left over from knee surgery), I walk 3 to 4 miles grabbing debris from sidewalks and gutters. I am joined by one of my tennis partners and together we pick up 200 to 300 pieces of debris (our specialty is plastic) per walk that otherwise would have ended up in storm drains and the Chesapeake Bay. Our walks began in our own neighborhood of Bolton Hill, but the thrill of the chase to grab one more bottle or can has led us up and down Charles Street, Eutaw Place, St. Paul Street and Maryland Avenue. We always take note of where we can empty our catch into city trash bins. We welcome any fellow confined citizens to come and join us. Lynn Cripps, Baltimore Virtual college reveal We’ve been friends with three other families forever. Each family has two or three kids. My daughter is the oldest of all of them. Last spring, when she was finishing high school, we decided to host a college reveal party. Sort of like the now popular gender reveal parties, but instead of baby blue or pink, the reveal would be the colors of the college she planned to attend. Going in, I had limited expectations, but it turned into a really positive time to celebrate her accomplishments, pray over her and wish her well in this scary and exciting new chapter. This spring, the second oldest (a boy in one of the other families) was up. He too planned to attend college, but what would that look like this year? The final part of his college search had been curtailed and family finances were suddenly less secure. Given the uncertainty, would he and his family want to make such a commitment? And would there be any opportunity to honor him, like we had my daughter? We soon found out. In late April, one week before the college decision deadline, we received an email from his mother with the subject line “College Reveal Ready.” It was on! We were asked to guess the winning college and to make a “Go XXX!” sign to support it. Then, on the day of, we received a knock on the door. When we opened it, no one was there — just three small homemade boxes, wrapped with string and with a “no peeking” sign on top. That evening for dinner, we joined the four-frame Zoom call, one window for each family. We all scrunched together and waved our signs. Then at the designated moment, we ripped the box tops off. Inside were red velvet whoopie pies and cupcakes, with yellow butter cream frosting. In an instant, we knew he would be going to Calvin University. There was much clapping and hollering. I sunk my teeth into a cupcake and thought what a sweet moment it was, despite all the uncertainties. Barnaby Wickham, Baltimore Gardening my way through the pandemic Working in the garden has both given me a way to fill up the dull days of the shutdown and to cling to a promise of better days ahead. When the wind isn’t blowing and my knees are willing, I ride my bike from my Bolton Hill home to the plots I rent in the community garden in Druid Hill Park. There is not much traffic, a few joggers and dog walkers but we all keep our 6-foot distance. The only tight space is on the Wyman Park Drive overpass that crosses the Jones Falls stream. More often than not, a photographer or two is planted on the overpass sidewalk aiming a camera at the nest a night heron has made in trees above the stream. Nature attracts even in a pandemic. In the park, crews have taken down the basketball goals and the ball fields are empty of teams, yet the roads are alive with exercisers. Runners, cyclists and parents pushing strollers are regulars. In March, no one wore masks. In April, they are common. There are 70-plus plots in our community garden, but crowding has not been a problem. Sometimes I am there alone, with just the wind, the mockingbirds and the worms. When human company does arrive, conversation breaks out at a distance. We discuss gardening routines and disruptions of normal life. Munching on an apple, I talk with Tom a respiratory therapist with the Veterans Affairs who installed a drip irrigation watering system in his garden plot. At his request I toss him my apple core which he deposits in a buried jug, home for a colony of compost-eating red worms. He tells me that at the hospital he had become so accustomed to wearing a mask that he accidentally tried to eat a sandwich while still masked. It did not go well. Jamie, a woodworker, has fashioned raised-bed wood boxes as well as an elaborate trellis for his crops. He reports that his work routine has changed. Lately he has been busy making coffins for funeral homes. Teresa pauses from turning over the soil in her plot to say she recently chose not to attend the funeral of a relative because it would mean too many people would be gathered too close together. Spring is a time of anticipation, especially now. Like many gardeners I can’t wait for uncertain weather to yield to familiar warmth. I know some of the seedlings — tomato, eggplant, fennel — nursed under my basement grow light might shrivel when they are soon exposed to the harsh realities of garden life. But some will make it. And the prospect of enjoying the salad days of summer keeps me going in the gloom. Rob Kasper, Baltimore Turning a job loss into opportunity I had worked in the automotive industry since 1995; where I became accustomed to the ups and downs of the business. But I always wanted to work in a field that gave me a sense of higher value and more stability. So, I decided to become a part-time independent life insurance agent, which I’ve done on and off since 2012. Then in March, I was laid off from my full-time automotive job due to COVID-19. This was the second layoff in my field of work since the 2008 financial crisis. Maybe it is out of fear, or just determination to make a legacy for myself and my family; I decided to launch a full-time business. I am now the sole proprietor of Dunlap Financial Services, an independent life, health, travel, and Motor Club of America agent. I was once a young, black, male, unintentionally heading down the wrong path. I am now 47 years old, engaged to be married for the first time on May 9 (our wedding plans have changed due to the virus), and I am excited about turning another negative (layoff) into a triple positive and overcome the past and build the future. Greg Dunlap, Baltimore Backyard haircuts and coming home during a pandemic Where I grew up, there was (and is to this day) a charter bus garage adjacent to our backyard. I fell asleep to the sounds of idling engines and the ringing of singing tools as mechanics burned the midnight oil. To me, it was a beautiful place. Of our property we could boast two things: the first, our noisy, but arboreal backyard; and the second, our father’s presence, which earned us the distinction of being one of the few two-parent households in the neighborhood. When I was 4, my father began to take me to the barbershop. It became a tradition. I would sit for hours, intermittently listening to the din of shoptalk. Once we got our fades, we would go to 7-Eleven, where my father would buy Slurpees. This would continue until my adolescence, at which point I realized that my cut grew antiquated. I would also realize that I was too afraid to speak up about it. One day, I decided otherwise. A new barber had rented a booth in the shop near where the younger clientele would congregate. I leapt at the opportunity, telling the junior barber what I wanted. I sat in the chair, excited and confident, and was promptly taken for a fool. My fade had ended up becoming a completely bald head. In light of this, and in the middle of my parent’s breakup, I had decided to break the tradition I had shared with dad for 10 years. It would be the last time I visited the shop. He couldn't understand. His disapproval of my growing hair and my growing disdain for barbershops culminated in a yearslong tension between us. Eventually, enough years passed for my hair to stretch past my shoulders. With those years also came healing and reconciliation. My father became not only accustomed, but fascinated by my new hair. I would maintain my distance from barbers, instead coming to own a pair of clippers for the sake of trimming my hair. My father and I are close. That one decision set me on the path to earn my autonomy and his respect. My father and I laugh together, perhaps more now than in my childhood. I love him, unconditionally. After a decade, during a pandemic, I came home. Dad called, asking a favor. We met up the next day. At almost 24-years-old, my hair, long, copper and coiled into locks, falls between my shoulder blades. For Dad, age 60 approaches, and his hair, like mine, is largely bereft of the dark ebony coils that I remember growing up. Our yard is no longer the verdant garden it once was. No longer do humming buses lull me to sleep. The bus company grew tired of our ‘arboretum’, which encroached upon their property. Their heavy-handed pruning killed the trees. Mom and dad are no longer together. Yet, somehow, in spite of COVID-19, our family reunited, our yard became a barbershop, and I was holding the clippers. Philip Harris, Baltimore Theater productions with my granddaughters As an involved grandmother, I have been lucky enough to have become a significant part of my two granddaughters’ lives. From the time they were infants, creating lasting memories with them has always been a top priority for me. This was relatively easy when they were babies and through preschool, even though they lived an hour away. However, once they started first grade, it became harder to see them. Before the pandemic, we had sporadic sleepovers, because they live so far away and have activity-filled schedules. Since the virus has made this method of interaction taboo, I had to find some other way to communicate and engage them. Enter the widely popular FaceTime and Zoom apps. Since the kids weren’t in school, I have been able to connect with them on a daily basis using the technology. Initially, I started reading them children’s classics, like “Little Women.” Ironically, the book about a family coping with a profound loss after the Civil War proves very appropriate to the current times we are now facing. After reading each chapter, I asked the girls the moral (there usually was one), and they were able to describe it accurately. For instance, being happy with what you have as long as you are around those you love. I called our daily readings, “Nonni’s Book Club.” As Easter approached, I became more creative and directed a play with the girls acting all the roles. The Easter play was comprised of two parts; one was religious and the other was a musical with Easter songs. Each part included costumes and choreography put together by the girls. The “Easter Parade” number was replete with floppy, flowery, beach hats as bonnets and umbrellas as twirling parasols. During one performance, the older granddaughter scolded the younger one for kicking too high. To which the younger one replied: “What do you want, I play soccer!” The hardest part was insuring the number of lines in the “play” were equal — those munchkins even counted how many words each had. (I don’t know how Spielberg does it!) Rave reviews proclaimed it was a smashing success, even though they were from biased family and friends. I must admit, that I really miss my granddaughters’ warm hugs, sweet kisses and precious little arms around my neck. Unfortunately, like everyone else, this is our normal until a vaccine can be discovered. In the interim, I will relish this daily interaction with them, that I never had before the crisis. So even in the midst of all the devastating tragedy, I found this opportunity that would never have been possible otherwise. It is the highlight of my very long day, and oh, the memories we are creating. Linda deKowzan, Lutherville I survived war, I can survive COVID-19 Seventy-five years ago my family joined another family in a covered wagon and fled from the Russian army only 35 miles away advancing toward our home in East Germany. Our group consisted of two mothers with three children each and a French POW who drove our wagon pulled by two big horses. We headed west into the unknown. Everyone was scared, many had lost family members and no one knew how or when the war would end. The fear and the unknown are somewhat similar to life today. However the danger was much greater then. We were not allowed to flee and thus were afraid of fanatical Nazis, who might stop us, and foreign airplanes overhead that were dropping bombs. We just hoped to get out alive and were lucky that we did. Today, I’m in my comfortable home. In good weather I go out and garden and feel very lucky. And best of all, I am looking forward to the birth of our first great-grandchild later this year. Bettina Jenkins, Baltimore Forget reading; I’m sewing face masks If you told me six months ago that while under a pandemic-induced government order to remain at home, I would spend my time making face masks, I would not have believed you. I have always been a voracious reader and a compulsive writer. My answer would have been that I would dive into my reading and make more progress on writing my young adult novel. But that is not what I do. What I do is sew face masks. This opportunity fell into my lap. When I heard that there would be no in-person Easter service or Preakness festivities, my heart sank. I enjoy sewing, but there was no point in making my annual Easter and Preakness dresses and hat like usual. I felt sad and sorry for myself. Then someone asked for face masks. I had an abundance of fabric scraps, elastic and seam binding. I was off and running. To date I have made approximately 15 dozen face masks for friends and family and neighbors, as well as health care facilities like Johns Hopkins, University of Maryland Saint Joseph’s Medical Center, Gilchrist Hospice, Greater Baltimore Medical Center and our own Jacksonville Senior Center. I also made some for veterinary workers. With all that sewing, I eventually ran out of supplies. That is when the magic started happening. I have received the most beautiful fabrics from generous people in our community. Beautiful animal prints came in via a connection on the Nextdoor social media service. My friend from college sent an entire box of batik cotton in glorious prints. My neighbor dropped off a large box of ribbons and spools of thread. Others contributed seam binding and elastic which has become as valuable as toilet paper. My own grandson, Luke, age 11, sent a check for $20 for supplies. In an ingenious stroke of parenting, his father distributed his work bonus among his three children with a caveat. They had to research charities and make a presentation to him to explain their choices. My face masking enterprise, quite literally, made the cut. I think the pandemic has made many of us more self-reliant. I know I have unjammed my sewing machine several times. Before I would have just taken it to the shop. I also am keeping it well-oiled and maintained when before that task may have lapsed. In many ways this unfortunate pandemic has brought out the good in many people. People tell me I am noble for doing this work. No. I just enjoy sewing. I love choosing the fabric, threading the machine, even ironing the mask when it is completed. It is a tactile experience. So, you will excuse me now while I get back to my face masks. Linda Rains Allman, Phoenix “Everything is closed because of breaking news” “Everything is closed because of breaking news.” That is how my son with autism describes COVID-19 and the closures that are in place because of it. For people with autism, routine and structure are vital. In one day he lost his job and his day program. His schedule for weeks has been reduced to home activities and walks. It’s is difficult because we cannot tell him when this will end. We cannot show our fear and anxiety which would set off his anxiety. He has self-imposed food restrictions so, yes, we frantically purchased as much of his particular food in mass. If you could not find Stouffer’s Macaroni & Cheese you can blame me. My husband and I could eat grubs as long as he has macaroni and cheese. Since his schedule and obsessive compulsive disorder dictate that we shop for his food one week at a time, extra food has to be hidden from him. Thank goodness for friends with extra freezer space. Social distancing isn’t something we can explain to him. When we go to a store we wipe everything and remind him to “stay close and hands in your pockets.” I’m pretty sure I scared a family at Wegmans grocery when I yelled, “Andrew STOP!” when he got too close to them. In my defense, they didn’t appear to be taking this seriously, so I think they needed to be frightened of me if not the virus. We always joked that eating dirt during his formative years gave him an amazing immune system and we hope it will protect him, and in turn us, from getting sick. We are over age 60 and live alone with him. Concerned about what would happen to him if we became ill, hospitalized, or worse, we updated our will to protect him. He could not be left home alone and out-of- state family would not be able to help him. Not exactly a highlight of our captivity. On the flip side, he is oblivious of the seriousness of the pandemic. So we put on a happy face and live in “Andrewland” with games, Disney movies and drive-thru french fries. We look forward to no more breaking news. Paige Pape, Towson At home looking after my parents I am stuck at home in Brooklyn Park with my parents while COVID-19 has everyone on virtual lockdown. I usually work overseas in Iraq as a contractor doing information technology work in a surgical hospital, which I have done for 17 years. I also was a soldier for 13 years. I had to come home in January due to the unrest which was going on in Iraq. I wait at home to one day go back, but thankful my company is still paying me as I can do remote work for all the people who work for my company around the world. I am already used to staying at home because I normally work on a compound and cannot go anywhere. So this is easy for me. I am really glad to be home with my parents whom I can take care of and make sure they are doing well, as I think we are in this for the long haul. I don’t leave the house much except to walk the dog in the yard. I cannot take a chance of going anywhere because I do not want to pass this on to my parents. My day is spent working out, watching Netflix and walking the dog. I have got mail patrol also. I am the only one allowed to initially handle any mail that comes in. I wear gloves, Lysol wipes and do not bring the letters and packages through the house. Instead, I walk around back, clean it off and hold it up to the window so my Mum can see and let me know if it stays or goes. We have also been ordering groceries to have them delivered about every two to three weeks so that I am not going out to the store and maybe picking the virus up. The hardest part of all of this is going to be mental, but you have to stay as busy as you can and have a plan whether it is to get in better shape or clean the house. Jerry Parsons, Brooklyn Park Grocery shopping like its 1973 As an elder trying to outwit a virus, I’ve said goodbye to easygoing and spontaneous food shopping. Stripped shelves and frantic competition now force me to stay in the fast lane and plan my every move. I’ve reverted to the mindset of my mid-20s. Then, shopping was made hectic by: a tight budget, reliance on public transit, and a menu dictated in part by deliveries from a food co-op. If they sent goat milk, I had to plan accordingly, and not forget the right ingredients. Suddenly, 2020 feels like 1973. Baltimore-area food stores began offering early-morning slots to reduce the risk of coronavirus. Hence, at 6:30 a.m. on March 20 — the first day that one local chain provided sheltered shopping for seniors — I arrived at a supermarket in Columbia. Dozens of early birds were already there, jostling with personnel who were resolutely restocking. I pulled my turtleneck nearly up to my eyes and went directly to the meat counter. It was picked over, yet better-stocked than would be likely later that day. I secured my prize: a corned beef brisket, to mark St. Patrick’s Day (just three days late). Next, I bee-lined to the bread aisle. Success! Pumpernickel, to make brisket sandwiches from the leftovers. I saw a friend from church and we chatted, quite briefly and at a distance. When the senior-shopping slot ended at 7 a.m., I was in line for self checkout. My 7:10 a.m. receipt was for $59.69. Next stop, an organic grocery store, where I had learned that at-risk customers could shop prior to the store’s 8 a.m. opening. One catch: I found the carts chained together outside and had to settle for a basket. I selected a 2-pound bag of carrots. Among staples at home, I already possessed cabbage, potatoes and sauerkraut to go with the corned beef. But I also wanted Swiss chard to prepare with poached eggs for breakfast. A produce manager was replenishing the chard, and I kept my distance as he helped me find my preferred rainbow variety. I still had a long list: cage-free eggs, nuts, pickles, power bars. Also, my favorite sparkling water was on sale, in bulk. But where to put it? I grabbed a cart from a worker doing inventory and tossed in my shopping basket and water. Time was growing short. As in my youth, when I watched the clock to avoid missing a bus home, I rushed to the cashier. My receipt, for $40.11, read 7:58 a.m. I exited, feeling stressed. I might have eluded the virus — but not the bad old day s of treating the grocery store like a racetrack. Patricia Fanning, Columbia COVID-19 gave us quality time with our dog in her last days “Every cloud has a silver lining” is an expression that has been around probably as long as pandemics have. Our family has taken the social distancing guidelines very seriously. Three out of four of us have not ventured out into the world since March 13th — 47 days and counting. And while that has seemed to be our cloud, I have realized that we experienced a silver lining during this time as well. Our 12-year-old black lab Bella was a little confused about the sudden 24-hour company she now had. She was having episodes where she struggled to breathe, and when these occurred, we surrounded her like a little tribe, encouraging her to stay calm and work her way through it. As these episodes increased, we realized that her quality of life was rapidly declining. But how lucky were we that we weren’t rushing off to work, to school, and to sports practices? How lucky were we to be able to cuddle with her, to feed her treats and to shower her with our love and affection all day long? And when the day came, we weren’t distracted by meetings or homework or other obligations. Our world shrank until it was just our family. On a sunny day, at her favorite spot on our Bush River-Park Beach, we spent two hours focusing just on her. Time we never would have had if it weren’t for the social distancing guidelines we were following to fight COVID-19. We reminisced about Bella’s adventures near and far — from our neighborhood to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. We told her how much we loved her, how much we will miss her, and how sad we were that dogs can’t live longer. So now it’s quiet around here. We stay in our house for our safety and the safety of others. But now it’s just a house — a place to in which to shelter. For our house is not truly a home without our dog Bella in it. Shelley Mezan, Aberdeen Business is shutdown, but not for good It was a surreal feeling when Gov. Larry Hogan announced the closing of nonessential businesses. I had heard the words, but in that moment I had so many questions. I am self-employed and the BrowoloJy eyebrow, skin care and makeup salon is my main source of income. So what now? Can I work from home? Can I provide mobile services? How long will this last? Do I have to pay the salon’s rent? So many questions! I had just invested a large amount of money into learning a new semi-permanent makeup technique for brows and had only done one client before this all happened. This service was to be the addition I needed to take my business to a new level and I was excited to start. COVID-19 put an immediate stop to that as well as all other services in an instant. After hearing the news, not processing it fully, I immediately went to the salon, which is located in a building of over 100 other salon suites. Mondays are typically stylists days off so there weren’t many people there. Those of us that did show up were there to take our products home with us. I didn’t know what to take or how much to take because I wasn’t even sure how long this was going to last. My thought process was to let myself have at least a few of each item so I can still sell products and possibly offer mobile services if any clients contacted me. As things continued to escalate, I realized that it wasn’t safe to enter their homes and later it had been decided that mobile services would not be permitted. As we approach week 6 of the shutdown with no sign of when we will be allowed to reopen I have been through all of the emotions. Happy that I am safe and healthy, and so is my family, uncertain and frustrated, but also having a sense of calm that I can appreciate through this process. Sadness comes in when I look at my appointment book and see all of the networking and social events, proms and weddings that I would have provided services for now canceled. Slowing down and having time to do all of the things I never have time to do has been the bitter sweetness in this situation. I am able to maintain business through product sales. I also have a home-based business that provides health and wellness products, which has been perfect with so many of us dealing with stress and anxiety right now. Most of all, my clients have been so amazing and sowing monetary gifts into my business as if they were receiving their regular monthly services. That has been the most unexpected and touching gesture and I am so grateful for them. It feels good to know that they are with me during this time and that when this is over they will still be there. COVID-19 has taken away many business opportunities but it has not taken my business. BrowoloJy is still alive and will come back even stronger when this is all said and done. Jalea Dodson, Lochearn

.W
Carroll County saw 10 more coronavirus cases, but no deaths, according to data released by the health department on Thursday afternoon. There have been 526 coronavirus cases in Carroll and 65 deaths. Of the 10 new cases, three were at elder care facilities and seven are community cases, that is, positive tests for Carroll countians who are not residents or staff members at long-term care facilities. Eight more people were released from isolation, meaning that 115 residents are no longer considered sick (at least 72 hours have passed since recovery and at least seven days have passed since symptoms first occurred). There have been 32 hospitalizations of community members. Of Carroll’s 234 community cases, six are younger than 10 years old; 11 are in the 10-19 range; 37 are 20-29 years old; 30 are 30-39; 28 are 40-49; 79 are 50-59; 30 are 60-69; five are 70-79; and eight are 80-89. Westminster has the most cases in Carroll, with 220 across two ZIP codes. Mount Airy has 129, followed by Sykesville/Eldersburg with 94, Hampstead with 19, Taneytown with 18, Manchester with 14, Finksburg with 11 and New Windsor with eight. There have been 13 cases in other Carroll ZIP codes. (Data is suppressed in ZIP codes with seven cases or fewer to protect confidentiality.) There have been 292 living facility cases. The health department lists all facilities with active outbreaks, excluding those at which at least 14 days have passed since the last outbreak. There are currently eight facilities in Carroll with an active outbreak.  Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

Howard County Pride canceled due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
This year’s Howard County Pride has been canceled, joining the long list of county and state events forced to postpone or cancel after the growing threat of the coronavirus has spread across the country. The second annual Howard County Pride was set to take place June 27; now those plans will have to wait until next year, said Jumel Howard, president of the Howard County Pride group. “We [had] been monitoring the developments regarding COVID-19 for some time now. It’s been difficult to see how things were going to unfold because you get different messaging from different people,” said Howard, 24, of Columbia. The inaugural event to celebrate the county’s LGBT community attracted 10,000 people to Centennial Park in June 2019. This year, the celebration was to move to Merriweather Park at Symphony Woods in downtown Columbia. Inner Arbor Trust, the nonprofit that controls Merriweather Park, had originally suggested the event be postponed until the end of the year. Howard said with increasing uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, he felt canceling would be a better decision. Earlier this week, the Annapolis Pride Parade, which also held its inaugural event last year, scheduled for June 27 was postponed. Baltimore Pride, which was planned for June 20 and 21, announced Wednesday on its Facebook page that its annual event was being postponed after speaking with medical experts and city officials. The post says organizers are working with Baltimore officials to reschedule the event for late August or September. Stephanie Cascone, marketing coordinator of Howard County Pride, and Howard are still meeting with the planning committee to brainstorm ways to bring Howard County Pride into residents’ homes; like many organizations, they said they are exploring virtual options. “We’re still in the early phases of what that will look like,” Cascone, 34, said of the potential online plans. “We want to bring elements that might be in a festival into the digital phase. We want to still engage our community.” Until then, Howard, Cascone and other planning committee members are calling sponsors and vendors with the news and asking what they would like to do with their contribution: keep it for Howard County Pride 2021 or take it back. Howard acknowledged the financial difficulty many businesses are facing right now. “Many craft vendors that did give to us could really use that money,” he said. “In the deepest parts of my heart, I’m hoping that a Pride 2021 can go off as we imagined a Pride 2020 would have,” Howard said.

PEEPshow postponed by Arts Council in reaction to coronavirus 
.W
The PEEPshow, annually one of the best-attended tourist events in Carroll County, is the latest casualty of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Judy Morley, executive director of the Carroll County Arts Council, confirmed on Monday that the 13th annual PEEPshow, which had been scheduled for April 3-13 at the Carroll Arts Center in Westminster, has been postponed indefinitely. “Due to the ongoing state of emergency regarding COVID-19, the Carroll County Arts Council has no choice but to indefinitely postpone the 2020 PEEPshow. We are committed to still holding the exhibit this year,” Morley said in a statement emailed to the Times. “This is a rapidly evolving situation, so we can not speculate on when we can reschedule the event. We are currently looking at late May or early June, but we’ll certainly keep you posted." Each year, this event features a display of sculptures, dioramas, graphic arts, oversized characters and mosaics created and inspired by Peeps, the marshmallow candy created by Just Born. It traditionally draws more than 20,000 visitors, most of whom pay for the right to vote for their favorite pieces of art. Last year, more than 160 artists created “marshmallow masterpieces.” The Arts Council still plans to hold what has become its biggest fundraiser. “If you are a PEEPshow artist who is already working on or finished their entry, please stand by. We hope that you are able to hold onto your entry until the new dates. We aim to hold the event in close to the standard format at the future date," Morley said. "We look forward to providing an event that can once again bring the community together and allow us to celebrate joyfully with our friends and neighbors, once the state of emergency has passed.” The coronavirus also known as COVID-19 is causing widespread disruptions as the number of cases increases both in Maryland and the United States. The first positive test was announced Friday in Carroll County, Gov.

Trump’s cost-cutting coronavirus response deserves scrutiny | READER COMMENTARY
.W
Thank you for The Baltimore Sun’s in-depth coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Leonard Pitts’ commentary, “A eulogy for competence amid coronavirus concerns” (March 3), highlights the incompleteness of President Donald Trump’s uneven response to our national health crisis. Specifically, the Trump administration’s funding plan to address this epidemic deserves a rigorous review and critique. While a responsible, sufficiently-funded federal strategy is essential, President Trump’s plan to shift many millions of dollars from National Institute of Health programs that address the opioid and addiction epidemics is a myopic approach. Slashing funds from dozens of other programs devoted to current health crises is terrible health care policy. His proposed cuts for aging and disability services, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, mental health and rural health programs are short-sighted. Ironically, these cuts are especially harmful for people with drug addiction as people who use drugs are especially susceptible to the kind of respiratory infections that coronavirus spreads. This epidemic requires an emergency supplemental appropriation with a fast-track plan for getting the funds and medical supplies to state and local health departments, hospitals and other treatment providers.

Life as an Asian American teenager during coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
Since the outbreak of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was first reported by the World Health Organization, it has spread like wildfire. It first made its way through Asia and then landed itself all over the world. People in many countries are scrambling to find disinfectant wipes, face masks and hand soap to try to combat this new pandemic. This disease has caused fear in families all over the world. Yet people are characterizing it as an Asian disease and using xenophobic terms to do so. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines xenophobia as “fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign.” This is what leads to racism. During this coronavirus crisis many Asians have described instances where they are blatantly chastised simply for their ethnicity. While scrolling through Instagram, I’ve found numerous posts with examples of Asians being bullied in school, publicly shamed and even beaten up on the streets. When there is a problem, society always finds something or someone to blame, and in this case it’s Asians. In society’s eyes, coronavirus is the fault of Asians because it originated in Wuhan, China. People fabricate stories in their minds about Asians who purposefully want to kill off the entire world and spread a deadly disease to do it. At first it started with one or two instances and now racist coronavirus-related stories crop up everyday. It has become the norm to see countless examples of Asians being mistreated because of their race and nationality. I am a 14-year-old high school student and all I can say is that society is so naive. They don’t look at the whole story. They assume that because coronavirus originated in China, it’s the fault of the Chinese. It must be upsetting, especially for the Chinese, to hear people addressing COVID-19 as the "Chinese virus” or any other derogatory name. Chinese people are all victims of the coronavirus just like everyone else. Many Chinese Americans have family members who passed away from the coronavirus. Those families can’t even visit their deceased relatives because they can’t travel to their home country. Same goes for many other Asian Americans. Asian Americans are going through hard times right now and we must help each other and pick each other up. The other day, my mom and I went to the Korean supermarket to stock up food. There, I walked past two sisters who kept on whispering to themselves. I walked past them multiple times and eventually they called out “corona time,” blatantly and in public. For a moment, I was too shocked to say anything. Then, I was embarrassed because other people started looking at me. And then I felt angry because it wasn’t right for them to do that. Yes, I am Asian American and I’m a very proud Asian American. It is not right for me to be treated badly because of my race. A friend of mine from school posted on her Instagram story the other day about her own firsthand experience with coronavirus-related racism. She wrote that someone left the Starbucks line because she was Asian. Having to deal with coronavirus, the disease itself, is exhausting and scary. Having to deal with the fear and embarrassment of hearing racist comments in public and being chastised for just being Asian is unacceptable Now, even though the coronavirus is strong and spreading faster than ever, it’s not too late for people to take a step back and change their attitudes toward Asians. Among the mean and nasty comments, I have seen many inspiring quotes on Instagram and other social media platforms, such as, “Coronavirus does not validate your racism.” This is a call to action. Coronavirus is not just an “Asian problem.” It’s a problem that is impacting everyone around the world. So everyone must work together to find a solution instead of blaming others for a problem that is essentially all nature’s doing.

When will it end? Social distancing, uncertainty make coronavirus uniquely challenging 
.W
In Baltimore and elsewhere, the novel coronavirus is upending things in ways we’ve never experienced. Forget about coming together in a time of crisis. We’re not supposed to touch. And it’s worse than a snowstorm, because we don’t know when it will end. “Social distancing,” an Orwellian-sounding phrase many of us had never heard until recently, is suddenly a way of life. Schools, libraries, museums, courts — the major institutions of public life — are closed, as public officials scramble to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, a highly contagious respiratory illness that has killed more than 5,000 people. As of Friday, the U.S. had reported a total of 1,215 cases and 36 deaths across the nation. Maryland is reporting 19 cases. ‘We’re being asked to isolate ourselves’ At first, this latest disruption of daily life reminded Michael Evitts of 2015, when unrest following the death of Freddie Gray closed businesses in Baltimore and led to a citywide curfew. Back then, Downtown Partnership, where Evitts works, encouraged residents to “come together” and to support local businesses and restaurants. But the coronavirus has revealed itself to be an altogether different crisis. For one thing, health experts and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control encourage people to practice social distancing, defined as keeping six feet away from the next person, and avoiding groups. Social distancing measures during pandemic can include closing childcare centers, malls and movie theaters, suspending religious services. Mass transit may be shut down. The rationale is simple. “When you decrease social interaction in a community there’s going to be less opportunity for a disease to spread,” Tom Inglesby, director of Johns Hopkins’ Center for Health Security, explained in a podcast. Proponents point to the example of the 1918 influenza epidemic. In Philadelphia, where authorities continued to allow public gatherings until well after the disease had spread, the death rate was twice as high as in St. Louis, where measures to limit public gatherings were put in place before the illness hit the city hard. But social distancing can wreak havoc on communities, both economically and psychologically. “We’re being asked to isolate ourselves,” said Evitts, the Downtown Partnership’s vice president of communications. “What we’re all being asked to do globally is not come together.” Baltimore-based economist Anirban Basu worries that distancing will become the norm. ‘It’s just a moving target’ As spring emerges, restaurants and other businesses often count on increased traffic as people embrace warmer weather and celebrate the end of winter. Instead, many are now finding a drastic slowdown as schools close, major events are cancelled, and people stay indoors. The worst part? No one knows for how long, said Basu. “If you have a really wicked snowstorm in February, you know it’s going to be gone by April,” said Basu. In this case, he said, organizers forced to cancel events don’t know when, or even if, they’ll be able to reschedule. With events like March Madness and others, the economic impact may be forever lost. He worries especially about people in the gig economy, like Uber drivers facing a huge drop off in customers. “This is going to cause a lot of economic pain,” he said. Further deepening the pain: People tend to make worse economic decisions in times of uncertainty, Basu said. “The fact of the matter is a lot of people will be economically damaged” by this pandemic. “And obviously, the more alarming news is that many people are going to pass away because of this.” Downtown Partnership hopes to work with area business on economic recovery when the time comes, Evitts said. “But we don’t know how bad or not bad it’s going to be.” For Basu, the virus has had a personal impact. He’s seen 13 speeches cancelled at conferences across the country. “My business depends on a lot of public speaking,” he said. “This is frankly a dreadful period for us.” “It’s just a moving target right now,” said Peggy Daidakis, executive director oft he Baltimore Convention Center. They’ve already had 17 cancellations for events and are trying to find new dates when possible or provide refunds when an organizer can’t reschedule. “We’re trying to work with them on some leniency so we’re not the ogres saying, ‘Well it’s too bad.’” Some events have found new dates. Two joint building conferences, the NFMT and the Clean Buildings Expo, together bring anywhere from 7,000 to 8,000 attendees and vendors to the convention center each spring, with an estimated $2.5 million to $3 million impact on Baltimore, according to a spokesman. But on Wednesday, organizers made the decision to postpone the conferences, scheduled for this weekend, until mid August. By then, they hope, the worst will be over.

Baltimore’s emergency management director on leave amid coronavirus preparations
.W
Baltimore’s emergency management director is on leave as the city prepares for an outbreak of the new coronavirus, a spokesman confirmed. David McMillan, director of the Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management, is on leave, said Lester Davis, a spokesman for Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young. He would not provide additional details Thursday, saying he was not at liberty to discuss personnel matters. McMillan, whose annual salary as of June 30 was $132,600, could not immediately be reached for comment. As recently as a week ago, he appeared at a meeting of the mayor’s top officials and also briefed the City Council on how Baltimore planned to react to COVID-19. “The situation is evolving,” he warned councilmembers March 5. In a statement Thursday morning that did not mention McMillan, Young said there is a team of “supremely qualified” people heading the Office of Emergency Management. Chief Charles Svehla, a top official in the Fire Department, is serving as acting emergency manager. Two other fire department officials — Chief James Wallace and Capt. Scott Brillman — are helping to handling the office’s day-to-day operations, Young said. The mayor said during a Wednesday news conference that there were no known cases of COVID-19 in the city, but said preparing for the illness is his administration’s priority. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday the total number of coronavirus cases counted in Maryland is 12. “The city is well-positioned,” Davis said. “We have a group of emergency managers who are well-trained and together have over 85 years of experience." Less than a year ago, McMillan was part of the team tasked with responding to the ransomware attack that crippled city operations.

Baltimore area companies plan for telecommuting amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Group has told its workers in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo to take meetings by conference call and work from home whenever possible. It has closed its office in Milan, Italy. While offices remain open in Baltimore and elsewhere, “associates in roles that do not require a physical presence in the office can choose to work from home,” the company said in a statement Thursday, a new policy that takes effect Monday until further notice. “The safety and well being of our associates is paramount, and we recognize the personal impact this outbreak is increasingly having on our associates globally.” Less than a week after health officials in Maryland confirmed the state’s first cases of the new coronavirus, known as COVID-19, companies are making plans to shift employees to remote work from home if the outbreak worsens. In Maryland, 12 people have tested positive for the virus, which has sickened more than 130,000 and killed 4,700 around the world, including 37 in the United States. Though Maryland has been spared a severe outbreak so far, health and government officials have warned residents to be prepared to work from home or in the event of closures of schools, businesses or airports. Already, schools and businesses have imposed travel restrictions and numerous colleges and universities in Maryland have cancelled classes days before Spring Break and are planning for remote instruction by computer in the weeks to come. Businesses say they are closely monitoring updates and following public health authorities’ guidance. In hard hit areas such as Seattle, big employers such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are having employees work from home. Teleworking may become an option at federal agencies in the state and elsewhere as well. Maryland’s U.S. senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, introduced legislation last week that requires federal agencies to expand teleworking. The senators, who introduced the bill with Sen. Mazie K. Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat, called the issue urgent, saying the growing coronavirus epidemic is placing greater strain on federal workers. T. Rowe Price said it has not had “significant business impacts and continues to serve our clients globally.” But it announced Thursday that it was suspending all domestic and international business travel, including in-person conferences and events, except for some approved exceptions, until further notice. “Our goal is to provide as much flexibility as we can, given the dynamics of the situation, the desire to reduce the chance of community spread of infection should an associate be diagnosed, and the need for certain roles to be in the office to maintain operations and serve our clients,” the company said. At Baltimore-based money manager Legg Mason, spokeswoman Mary K. Athridge said any employees who feel uncomfortable in the office "are able to work at home, per our flexible working arrangement. The firm’s human resources and “business continuity” specialists are monitoring the global situation daily to determine how it might impact employees and offices, Athridge said. “We are in regular communication with our employees regarding travel and office guidelines, including work from home options, restricting travel where appropriate, and asking colleagues to stay at home if they show signs of illness or have traveled to areas known to have cases of the Coronavirus,” she said. But telework isn’t an option for those jobs that can’t be done with smartphones and the internet. At Athena Enzyme Systems, a Halethorpe-based biotechnology company, most work is done in a lab, so there’s no work from home option. Instead, “our existing sick leave policy is set up well for this type of outbreak,” said Benjamin Broedel, Athena’s manufacturing operations manager. Athena employees have no set sick days but are allowed and expected to stay home if they are sick. Those days are not counted against vacation days and are paid. “This policy was set by the our CEO to prevent spread of illness internally, and to give employees more agency over their own health," Broedel said. "It also builds trust within the company, and we believe it increases employee happiness and productivity.”

Feeling worried about coronavirus? Here’s how to help
.W
Maryland officials continue to implore residents this week to wash their hands, maintain social distancing and disinfect surfaces in an effort to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Even with the latest, stay at home order from Gov. Larry Hogan amid the COVID-19 pandemic, his office on service and volunteerism has compiled a list of civic-minded ways Marylanders can help during the outbreak. Many organizations are looking for help in the form of nonperishable food items, financial assistance and volunteers. Some organizations are calling for medical contributions like donating blood as thousands of drives across the state have been canceled. Here are some local organizations that are asking for help: Maryland Food Bank has issued an urgent call for volunteers between the ages of 13 and 60 to pack up boxes containing 30 pounds of food for distribution to pantries and community organizations across the state for the remainder of the public health crisis. The Red Cross is asking people to make an appointment to donate blood at a center by going to RedCrossBlood.org or calling 1-900-RED-CROSS. Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland delivers two fresh meals daily to residents in need. The organization is looking for financial assistance and volunteers. All volunteer orientations have been converted to webinars. The World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund uses donations to fight the outbreak including by distributing supplies to frontline health workers and enabling countries to boost laboratory capacity through training and equipment. Baltimore Community ToolBank is accepting donations that will allow the organization to continue to loan various tools including tables and chairs to health professionals and first responders. Financial donations can be made on Facebook or on the Mighty Cause website. Governor’s Office on Service and Volunteerism is asking organization with the capacity to coordinate volunteers and or those with a volunteer opportunity for Marylanders, please email gosv.md@maryland.gov. Baltimore-area restaurants were hit hard after Hogan ordered all eateries and bars to halt on-premise dining. Marylanders wanting to support restaurants can order carryout or delivery from these establishments during the duration of the pandemic. A group of graduate students from Johns Hopkins created the website www.standbybaltimore.com, which lists and links to local businesses that have gift cards available for purchase. Maryland Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (MD VOAD) and the Adventist Community Services (ACS) are partnering with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency to provide drop-off sites for donations of medical and cleaning supplies. Officials will ONLY accept the following items: Unused N95 masks with or without valve  Protective goggles in original packaging  Unused nitrile gloves in original packaging  Unused hospital gowns in original packaging  Tyvek coats and bodysuits  Bleach, Lysol, cleaning supplies – must be unopened and unused  Face shields  Hand sanitizer Handmade, prototype or unapproved personal protective equipment WILL NOT be accepted. Food and household donations also WILL NOT be accepted at these locations. Also, DO NOT bring cash to these locations. Residents are encouraged to send monetary donations to local nonprofits and churches for support. The four donation drop off locations in Maryland are: Cambridge: 3105 Mallard Court., Cambridge, Md. 21613 Visible from Rt. 50. Drop off in the parking circle.  Ellicott City: 3291 St. John’s Lane, Ellicott City, Md.. 21042  Hagerstown: Mt. Aetna Retreat Center, 10375 Retreat Way, Hagerstown, MD 21742 May also be listed on GPS as 21905 Mt.

Archdiocese of Baltimore launches webpage to memorialize individual coronavirus victims
.W
In an effort to provide an alternative to funerals, most of which are prohibited during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Archdiocese of Baltimore has created a webpage on which members of the public may post memorials to friends or loved ones who have died of illnesses related to COVID-19. The page, which is on the archdiocese’s website, invites people to upload a photo and other information about a deceased individual along with his or her name, whether posters are Catholic or not. The idea is to give anyone who lives in or near Maryland the chance to celebrate a deceased loved one amid the crisis in a way current guidelines on public gatherings do not. The emergency order issued by Gov. Larry Hogan last month limiting the size of crowds to 10 until further notice forbids most funerals as Catholics generally practice them and bars all but the most intimate of sending-off ceremonies, whatever one’s faith tradition. That, Archbishop William E. Lori says, represents yet another way in which the guidelines recommended by health officials and mandated by local, state and federal governments, however necessary, leaves many yearning for spiritual connection as the coronavirus continues to spread. “At a time when funeral Masses aren’t safe to celebrate and when people aren’t able to gather, even for something as important as the death of a loved one, I pray this will allow people to express their prayerful love and support in a way that is safe, but also very meaningful to those who are grieving the loss of a loved one at this time,” Lori said in a statement on the website. Creating the webpage — and launching it this week — seemed like an effective way of marshaling the public’s apparently growing facility for digital communication toward a key spiritual end, said Sean Caine, a vice chancellor and spokesman for the for the archdiocese. In the absence of funerals, it also gives members of the public a chance to consider a deceased person as an individual, not just as one more in a growing body of statistics. “Especially when people aren’t able to participate in the same rites and rituals that they normally would, due to the prohibition on funeral Masses, we felt it was a way for all those people who would come to a funeral at least to be able to collectively pray for those individuals,” Caine said. “And even though people are obviously watching the numbers each day, so far nobody has really known the faces behind the numbers.” The Catholic church has a long tradition of praying for the dead, through funeral Masses, graveside services, Mass intentions and other commemorations, Lori said. Catholic funeral Masses, which traditionally take place in churches before many guests, are currently prohibited in the archdiocese and graveside committal services are limited to immediate family. “We are a people of faith, a people of prayer,” he added. “Though apart, we are united by our prayers for those who have gone before us, even those we don’t know. They are our brothers and sisters, part of our human family.” The page, known as “One Church, One Family,” has started modestly, featuring three deceased individuals as of Thursday, all in their 70s or older. But Caine is hopeful the initiative will gain in popularity as quickly as others the archdiocese is offering, including the Mass it livestreams and televises, with Lori as celebrant, from the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen at 11 a.m. Sundays. The first of those services, March 15, drew about 2,000 viewers, and the numbers have grown steadily. The Easter Mass attracted about 14,000 on digital devices and was seen live by about 100,000 more on WBAL-TV. Archdiocese officials are working to get word of the webpage to officials in its parishes, hospitals and schools in hopes of alerting “all people in contact with someone who has lost someone” during the pandemic, Caine said. “We’d love it if we didn’t have to add any names, but as long as this crisis continues, we hope more and more people will become aware of the page and find it beneficial,” he said. “We thought it would bring comfort to the families of those dying from this horrible disease and give people something to do that feels helpful. That’s a powerful, important thing.”

Layoffs in Maryland mount as businesses close during coronavirus crisis
.W
Employers in the Baltimore area have stepped up the pace and number of job cuts, with hotels, fitness studios and movie theaters reporting hundreds of layoffs in the first few days of April alone. As state-ordered business shutdowns continue during the new coronavirus pandemic, Maryland labor officials have been notified of an increasing number of layoffs. The Four Seasons Hotel in Baltimore, Embassy Suites Inner Harbor Hotel and Cinemark movie theaters in Towson and Hanover are among those reporting layoffs to the Maryland Department of Labor since April 1. In addition, Baltimore-based Under Armour said Friday morning that it will layoff 600 warehouse workers in the area because of a significant drop in sales during the crisis. They’re among about 6,700 employees at Under Armour brand and outlet stores mostly in the U.S. facing temporary layoffs starting April 12. The sports apparel maker’s stores have been closed since March 16 and will stay closed until further notice. The bulk of the job losses have piled up quickly in the service industry, at restaurants, hotels and stores. “I imagine the numbers will get worse before they get better,” said Daraius Irani, chief economist for the Regional Economic Studies Institute at Towson University “This is one of those extraordinary circumstances we’ve never experienced on this grand scale. We’re asked all the world economies to shut down and restart.” To slow the spread of the virus, Gov. Larry Hogan had ordered all bars, restaurants, gyms and movie theaters to close in mid-March. Since then malls and non-essential businesses also have been ordered closed and gatherings of more than 10 people have been prohibited. On Thursday, luxury hotel Four Seasons in Harbor East, east of Baltimore’s downtown, reported that it laid off 169 people as of March 23. CorePower Yoga on Wednesday reported 193 layoffs at five Maryland studios, including four in Baltimore, which took effect March 30. Cinemark announced 236 layoffs in Towson and Hanover on Wednesday, which took effect March 27th. Other hotels that reported layoffs in April include Embassy Suites Inner Harbor Hotel on St. Paul Place, Courtyard by Marriott and Residence Inn by Marriott, both in Salisbury, and Hampton Inn & Suites in Annapolis. Those layoffs follow others in the hotel industry since mid-March, including at Graduate Annapolis hotel in Annapolis and the Sheraton Columbia Hotel. Unemployment claims in Maryland and across the country have soared. The state labor department said Thursday that more than 84,000 people in the state filed jobless claims during the week ending March 28, double a record-setting amount from the previous week. More than 6.6 million people filed for unemployment in the U.S. during that week. “It’s a really rough patch we’re entering into,” Irani said. “The good news is this was not an asset bubble or people nervous about their wealth. Once we get past this, we should start to climb back to normal."

Carroll County announces 9 new cases of coronavirus, with 4 tied to Westminster retirement community
.W
The Carroll County Health Department announced nine new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Wednesday evening, bringing the total number of cases in the county to 103. Three of the cases, a woman in her 60s and two women in their 80s, are residents of Carroll Lutheran Village who recently transferred there from two undisclosed “Maryland hospitals,” according to a health department news release. All three are isolated in private rooms. A fourth case is a woman in her 20s who works at Carroll Lutheran Village and is now isolating at home, according to the release. Carroll Lutheran Village is described on its website as a continuing care retirement community in Westminster. The coronavirus also known as the disease it causes, COVID-19, is especially dangerous for older adults and those with compromised immune systems. “We are in daily contact with [County] Health Officer Ed Singer and his staff from the Carroll County Health Department, as well as staff from the Maryland Department of Health,” Ken Connelly, vice president of operations for Lutheran Social Ministries of Maryland, says in the release. “We continue to adhere to all protocols and recommendations from these agencies to help prevent further spread of the coronavirus.” The remaining five cases are people in the community: a man in his 20s, a man in his 30s, a man in his 40s, a woman in her 50s and a man in his 80s. No details were provided on their condition or location. None of the cases were associated with Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where 77 of 95 residents have tested positive for COVID-19, 17 people — including one staff member — have been hospitalized, and five people have died. The Maryland Department of Health promulgated guidelines for long-term and continuing care facilities in a time of COVID-19 on March 10, which can be found online at coronavirus.maryland.gov. Maryland confirmed another 325 cases Wednesday, pushing the state’s total to at least 1,985. The surge, the largest single-day rise in confirmed cases the state has experienced thus far, marks an increase of 19.6% over the total from Tuesday, the first full day of Gov. Larry Hogan’s executive order requiring Marylanders to stay home with the exception of essential reasons. A total of at least 31 Marylanders have died of the coronavirus, the state said Wednesday morning. The state reported it has issued 17,233 negative tests for the coronavirus, a rise of nearly 16% from Tuesday. Sixty-nine patients have been released from isolation. As of the evening of April 1, the coronavirus had resulted in more than 4,700 deaths in the United States out of more than 213,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic March 11. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

To limit coronavirus spread, reduce jail and prison population | COMMENTARY
.W
The coronavirus has significantly impacted all of our lives for the past few days, and will continue to do so for the next few weeks and perhaps months. Our state is at the forefront of taking necessary measures to "flatten the curve" and minimize this pandemic. One of the most important measures needed, which has yet to take place, is to immediately reduce the prison and jail population statewide. Jails and prisons are ground zero for public health issues. People are confined in close quarters without the ability to effectively exercise social distancing practices. There is limited access to showers and other hygienic measures. Corrections health systems, which already lack sufficient resources to address the full range of medical and behavioral health needs of prisoners, are ill-equipped to contain and treat this rapidly spreading virus. Detention facilities are a tinder for the coronavirus to spread even more rapidly — to detainees, corrections staff and everyone who comes in contact with them. Incarceration during this public health crisis is akin to a death sentence for the large number of current inmates who meet the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for heightened vulnerability. The state prison system alone has over 1,100 inmates over the age of 60, according to a list provided to the public defender’s office by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. This does not include the geriatric population in the county jails, as well as the large number of inmates who are infirm or immunocompromised, which places the number of incarcerated Marylanders at significant risk of serious illness or fatality even higher. The Maryland Judiciary announced on Saturday that all state courts will be closed to the public for the next three weeks, with only specified emergency matters continuing. The courtrooms remaining open are often small, overcrowded spaces without any measures taken for social distancing. With criminal trials suspended, defendants are pressured to plead guilty as the only way for them to take the basic precautions that the rest of us have available to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Arraignments, bail reviews and juvenile detention hearings are among the emergency matters that are continuing. These proceedings have the potential to further grow the inmate population and heighten the serious public health dangers, particularly as the state police and local law enforcement prepare to arrest people who violate the governor’s order. However, these court proceedings can also be used to provide a release valve to this public health pressure cooker. Older and infirm inmates, people held on low-level nonviolent charges, and those serving short sentences or are otherwise near release should be released right away. Nearly all of the geriatric prison population is eligible for parole now. The Maryland Parole Commission and the governor can make this happen. Courts can more readily grant release at bail review hearings, and many are already holding hearings to reconsider the detention of people currently in jail. State’s attorneys can dismiss and refile cases to allow for expedited release without requiring a court appearance while still maintaining the integrity of their case. Individuals meeting the CDC risk criteria, charged with minor offenses, or otherwise likely to be released within the next few months are both low public safety risks and exceptionally high public health risks. We can save their lives, reduce transmission risks and increase the space available in detention for those serving long sentences for serious violent offenses. Public defenders across the state are working hard to respond to this public health emergency, with district public defenders communicating with their local judiciary, state’s attorney and corrections leadership. Everyone must take responsibility to address the unique risks and concerns with keeping large numbers of people incarcerated who pose no immediate danger. Paul DeWolfe (pdewolfe@opd.state.md.us) is the Public Defender of Maryland.

Under Armour borrows $700 million to prepare for coronavirus pandemic
.W
Under Armour has borrowed $700 million through an existing line of credit to prepare for the effects of the new coronavirus pandemic on its sales of sports apparel and shoes. The Baltimore-based manufacturer and retailer borrowed through an existing revolving credit line of $1.25 billion, according to a filing Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The global brand said it borrowed funds from March 13 to March 20 “as a precautionary measure in order to increase its cash position and preserve liquidity given the uncertainty in global markets resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.” Under Armour had closed all 188 of its North American stores from March 16 through Saturday, calling the shutdown a precautionary measure to help stem the spread of the virus. Since Under Armour first closed its stores, most major U.S. retail chains also have shut down and have continued business online. In Maryland, schools, restaurants, nonessential businesses, malls and most gathering spots have been ordered closed, with residents urged to stay home. By Thursday, the state had at least 580 confirmed cases of the virus and four deaths. On Feb. 11 when Under Armour last reported financial results, it had said it expects sales to decline this year as the brand struggles to regain traction in its key U.S. market and feels the financial brunt of the outbreak, which at the time had caused more than 1,000 deaths in China but had not yet spread widely in the U.S., infecting fewer than a dozen people. An Under Armour spokeswoman did not immediately have an update Thursday on plans for Under Armour stores, which include Brand House locations and outlets. Under Armour had said earlier this month that it would continue to pay its employees through the temporary closure of stores and that it would step up sanitary measures in its corporate offices and distribution centers in the Baltimore region and around the world. The company’s use of its credit line this month represents a material increase in its borrowing, requiring it to be publicly disclosed. Under Armour said it plans to hold the borrowed funds on its balance sheet and said it could repay or reborrow certain amounts based on market conditions, business needs and other factors.

Racing suspended at Laurel Park because of coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Maryland Jockey Club has canceled live racing at Laurel Park until further notice as the state continues to impose tighter restrictions on gatherings in hopes of slowing the coronavirus pandemic. The move came in response to Gov. Larry Hogan’s announcement Thursday that all inessential gatherings of more than 10 people would be prohibited. Laurel Park hosted spectator-free racing last weekend and was scheduled to do so again starting today. But in addition to Hogan’s order Thursday, the New York Racing Association suspended racing at Aqueduct after a backstretch worker at Belmont Park tested positive for COVID-19. Top jockeys such as Irad Ortiz Jr. and Rajiv Maragh said they would stop riding because of the surging pandemic. The Maryland racing industry continues to wait for news on a possible postponement of the Preakness Stakes, scheduled for May 16. Hogan said Tuesday he had begun active negotiations to delay the race until September after Churchill Downs Inc. announced it would move the Kentucky Derby from May 2 to Sept. 5. Industry leaders and many horsemen had hoped to continue running at Laurel Park, saying it would be best for the state’s thoroughbred population and for the many barns that operate on slim profit margins. Some national racing officials even speculated that they could attract new fans by rolling on at a time when most sports have suspended play. “In accordance with the Maryland Governor’s Executive Orders and as part of the continuing effort to protect the health and safety of essential personnel and the horses they care for, the Maryland Jockey Club will temporarily pause live racing at Laurel Park and Rosecroft Raceway," the Jockey Club said in a statement. "Our top priority is the well-being of every person and every horse in our community and we look forward to resuming when the state and federal leaders and health authorities deem it appropriate to do so.”

From Sisqó to Peabody students, Baltimoreans address the coronavirus online
.W
Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. While that hasn’t been proved to cure COVID-19, widely known as the coronavirus, the artists, social media influencers and content creators of Greater Baltimore haven’t stopped using the internet to address the evolving pandemic. From comical videos advising proper handwashing protocol to satirical political photo ops, here’s how some in Baltimore are reacting to the growing crisis online. For instance, the Peabody Institute offered a video of its symphony orchestra performing Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 5 in E minor, Op. 64. “We remain committed to fostering community through the performing arts,” read a statement posted with the video. “In that spirit, before in-person classes were canceled this week, the students came together for a farewell performance.” Peabody students Todd Oehler and Layan Atieh also posted a longer version of the performance in a Facebook video March 10 that has received around 15,000 views. In addition, singer and famous Baltimore native Sisqó posted a video of him washing his hands along to lyrics from his 2000 hit “Thong Song” on Twitter on March 11. The second half of the verse and chorus aligned with the 20-second window that the CDC recommends for proper washing of hands. Baltimore rapper Butch Dawson also created a song, titled “No to Corona,” and accompanying video showing him washing his hands. “Wash your hands, even your bands, s*** don’t go as planned, so while you got the chance, you better wash your hands,” he raps. “I just wanted to use my platform to spread some awareness, because people know but [it’s better] if you can connect to a certain demographic, based on them receiving information differently,” Dawson said of younger people who he’s trying to reach with the song. Twitter user @BaltimoreMemes has consistently shared parody memes, including one about a fictional Old Bay hand sanitizer with the caption, “I’ll take a gallon!” A-list actress, producer, musician and Baltimore native Jada Pinkett Smith also shared a video to her Twitter in which she shows off exercises she’s done at home and lists five comedy shows she recommends to those in self-imposed quarantine.

Baltimore scientists to work on third experimental coronavirus vaccine
.W
An experimental corronavirus vaccine will begin production in a facility on the east side of Baltimore later this year, becoming the third potential vaccine involving Baltimore scientists and their labs. Gaithersburg-based Emergent BioSolutions Inc. said Wednesday that it would make a vaccine for the California company Vaxart Inc. Vaxart will then begin testing the tablet-based vaccine to see if it’s safe and it works to prevent infection from the rapidly spreading virus. Emergent, which has two Baltimore facilities, reported earlier this month that it would also produce another potential vaccine for Gaithersburg-based Novavax Inc., which it developed in Maryland. The University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development also is working on a vaccine for the new virus as part of a consortium established by the National Institutes of Health at Emory University in Atlanta to quickly tackle new infectious diseases. The Novavax and University of Maryland vaccines are expected to begin testing soon, before the latest Vaxart vaccine. But none of these vaccines or any other in development are expected to be ready for the public for another 12 to 18 months. Each vaccine, however, uses existing technology enabling them to be developed, go through multiple phases of testing and approved far more quickly than the normal process for new vaccines or drugs. “We look forward to applying our broad molecule-to-market services, including our ability to work with a multitude of delivery systems, execute under expedited timelines, and meet Vaxart’s potential need for future scalability and large-scale capacity for commercial quantities,” said Syed T. Husain, Emergent’s senior vice president and unit head for contract development and manufacturing. The coronavirus has caused more than 4,000 cases in the United States of COVID-19, a usually mild but sometimes severe respiratory disease. Every state in the nation now has a case, and there have been 75 deaths. There are no specific treatments for the disease, though those also are in the works. “I’m pleased that we are joining forces with an experienced manufacturer such as Emergent to help advance our oral COVID-19 vaccine to the clinic,” said Dr. Wouter Latour, chief executive officer of Vaxart, in a statement. “We believe an oral vaccine administered using a room temperature-stable tablet may offer enormous logistical advantages in the roll-out of a large vaccination campaign, and Emergent is a great partner to help in this endeavor.” Emergent produces its own vaccines and drugs but also is designated a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Bayview facility can produce tens to hundreds of million of doses of vaccines a year. Emergent also has a fill, finish and packaging facility in the Carroll-Camden industrial area that will be involved in the Novavax vaccine production.

Maryland universities helping students weather financial crisis created by coronavirus
.W
Wanderly Vargas was a senior Towson University psychology major two months away from graduation and looking for his first full-time job after college when the new coronavirus upended his life. One day he was finishing a lot of class assignments, and supporting himself with a campus job. The next day the campus was shutting down, he was worried his job would disappear and he was packing his bags to go home to his parents house in Prince George’s County. One of his parents has been laid off, the other is furloughed and now Vargas is working through class assignments using a hot spot on his phone for internet because his family doesn’t have high speed internet. “I am trying to stay positive and trust my resources and my network around campus. I am going to trust them,” Vargas said. “I have to move forward with life, even if I don’t want to.” The pandemic that shut down university classrooms has changed the world for everyone, including college students. Some of those students are struggling financially as they try to navigate finishing classes online. Vargas is one of thousands of students in colleges and universities across the state who are now reaching out to emergency student funds for help. For the past several weeks, Sarah Williamson, the coordinator in the office for student affairs at the University of Maryland, College Park, has pored over 1,100 applications from students for money from The Crisis Fund, to pay their rent or groceries. The Crisis Fund was set up in 2001 to help students with acute, short-term financial needs. It has doled out money to cover the cost of unexpected car maintenance, short-term medical expenses or even to replace lost or stolen textbooks. Now the need has exploded. Williamson is not the only administrator fielding calls and applications. At Morgan State University, Towson University and Johns Hopkins University, administrators have rushed to raise money from alumni, parents and friends of their institutions to help with the immediate needs of students trying to fly home suddenly or make rent at a time of stunning unemployment and still complete their spring semester online. Many students have lost jobs they needed to support themselves while they worked toward their degree, said Williamson. “A lot of our students have detailed how their parents have been laid off,” Williamson said, so their usual source of financial help isn’t available. The university has distributed nearly $379,050 to 803 students since March 11, when many colleges first decided to restrict access to campus. They are also expanding a food pantry which has remained open. Now that the funds are depleted, the university has put out a request to donors. As fast as the donations have come in, Williamson said, they are going out to students. Towson University is beginning to respond to the needs of its students as well. It has $194,000 for student emergencies and hardships and another $50,000 designated to provide food for students. And the university is raising more money to help students, according to Sean Welsh, a university spokesman. Johns Hopkins University started to take action the day its students were leaving campus for spring break by setting up a triage desk in one of its dorms to make it easier for students to find some help. The university booked flights for students who otherwise would not be able to get home, sending students to 17 states, a U.S. territory, Taiwan and Kenya, according to Jill Rosen, a university spokeswoman. Hopkins has provided $75,000 to its undergraduates for food and financial support to help them access online learning. And Morgan State University has launched a COVID-19 emergency fund through the Morgan State University Foundation, asking for donations from the Morgan community, said Dell Jackson, a spokesman. Morgan’s Office of Alumni Relations has launched a campaign to provide laptops to Morgan students in need and is making food available to students. Many of the students facing financial strains are the first generation in their families to go to college. Gexi Chavez, a junior elementary education major at Towson University, is one of those students who recently learned she will receive $400 to help with expenses. A resident assistant in a dormitory, Chavez also worked in a program supporting first generation college students. She remembers sitting in a biology class where few could concentrate because they were concerned about their futures. As word went out that students would move out of their dorms and classes would go online, she said, “everyone was kind of frantic. It was really unclear what was going to happen to the many students who don’t have a good housing situation.” She worried about herself, her family and the other 60 students in her dorm who were asking her questions that she had no idea how to answer. Chavez is now back at home with her parents, siblings, and cousins. Her parents have been laid off from their jobs, and she said she has lost work as well. She has internet in her house, but no private space to do her school work. Chavez spends her days searching for work online, trying to complete her classes for the semester and worrying about her family, most of whom do not speak English fluently. While she is aware that focusing on classes should be a top priority because obtaining a degree would help support her family in the long run, she said, Chavez is “more focused on how are we going to provide food in this household for the next month or two months.” She is grateful for Towson University’s help. "That took off so much stress and pressure.”

Third case of coronavirus announced in Carroll County; health department hopes to ramp up testing 
.W
The third person found with the coronavirus in Carroll County is a man in his 20s who is recovering at home, according to the county health department. The case is not associated with foreign travel, and the man had no known contact with the other cases, Maggie Kunz, public information officer for the county health department, said Thursday morning. Kunz said officials found out about the third case late Wednesday night. The second Carroll countian with the coronavirus, also known by the disease it causes, COVID-19, is a woman in her 30s with mild symptoms, the Carroll County Health Department announced Tuesday morning. She is in good condition and is recovering at home. The first Carroll case, a man in his 40s, was announced Friday afternoon. He is related to the woman who contracted the disease, according to the county health department. The health department is not releasing where in the county the people with COVID-19 have traveled, citing a need to protect their identities. The health department is investigating these cases with the help of the Maryland Department of Health. Communicable disease nurses will identify people who had contact with the patients and advise them of any actions to take. The health department has pledged to share information if any risk to the public is identified. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Local public health and hospital officials are working on plans to expand testing capability in Carroll County, according to a Thursday news release from the health department that lists guidelines for how and when to call a health care provider and ask about testing. The health department plans to inform the public when testing is expanded through its website at https://cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/ and social media channels on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. “Testing is limited at this time because COVID-19 is a new infection, and laboratories are working rapidly to increase availability,” the health department wrote. Testing is only available to those who have been referred by a heath care provider. Those who show worsening or severe symptoms — such as trouble breathing — should contact their medical provider. Those who are 65 or older, have other medical issues, are pregnant, or are immunocompromised should do so even with mild symptoms. At least 107 people have confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday morning, though the third Carroll case was not included in that total. The first Marylander to die from the disease was a Prince George’s County man in his 60s, Hogan announced Wednesday night. Hogan has also ordered nonessential businesses such as bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to close, and on Thursday he reduced a limit on mass gatherings to 10 people after previously ordering a limit of 50 people. As of Thursday afternoon, the coronavirus had resulted in at least 157 deaths in the United States out of more than 11,200 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic March 11. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Carroll County sees 44 new coronavirus cases, two deaths
.W
Carroll County saw an increase of nearly 10% in coronavirus cases in three days, with 44 new positive tests and two deaths since Friday evening, according to the Carroll County Health Department. The two people who died were both residents of Westminster Healthcare Center, an elder care facility in Westminster. One-quarter of the new positive tests (11) were residents of Fairhaven, an elder care facility in Sykesville. There have been 505 COVID-19 cases with 61 deaths among Carroll County residents, residents of long-term care facilities in the county, and staff members of such facilities who live in Carroll, according to health department data released Monday evening. There were 20 new cases at elder care facilities. Because COVID-19 tends to be more dangerous for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, long-term care facilities are particularly vulnerable to localized outbreaks. The total number of facility cases in Carroll stands at 281 with 55 fatalities, including one staff member who was a county resident. The health department lists all facilities with active outbreaks and there are currently eight such facilities. Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy has seen 84 resident cases with 28 fatalities as well as 42 staff cases, 17 of whom live in Carroll with one death.   Westminster Healthcare Center has seen 62 resident cases with eight deaths and nine staff cases (three Carroll residents).   Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster has seen 38 resident cases with eight deaths and 11 staff cases (10 Carroll residents).   Fairhaven has seen 35 resident cases with five deaths and five staff cases (no Carroll residents).   Sun Valley Assisted Living has seen 16 resident cases with four deaths and seven staff cases (four Carroll residents).   Birch Manor Healthcare Center in Sykesville has seen five resident cases.  Lorien Mount Airy has seen one resident case and five staff cases (two Carroll residents).  Springfield Hospital Center in Sykesville has seen four staff cases (two Carroll residents) Two cases and one death occurred at a facility or facilities no longer considered the site of an active outbreak (at least 14 days since the onset of the last case). While the majority of all Carroll cases have been among residents or staff members at elder care facilities, the majority of the new cases reported — 24 of 44 — were community cases, that is, positive tests among people not associated with such facilities. Carroll has now seen 224 community cases with deaths divided evenly between women and men. Five cases are younger than 10 years old; 10 are in the 10-19 range; 37 are 20-29 years old; 26 are 30-39; 29 are 40-49; 73 are 50-59; 29 are 60-69; six are 70-79; and nine are 80-89. There have been 30 hospitalizations and 94 people have been released from isolation. According to Health Department data, the ZIP code in Carroll County with the most new cases since Friday was 21784, Sykesville/Eldersburg, which saw an increase of 18 cases. Westminster has the most cases in Carroll, with 210 across two ZIP codes. Mount Airy has 128, followed by Sykesville/Eldersburg with 86, Taneytown and Hampstead with 17, Manchester with 14, Finksburg with 12 and New Windsor with eight. There have been 13 cases in other Carroll ZIP codes. (Data is suppressed in ZIP codes with seven cases or fewer to protect confidentiality.) Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

Maryland General Assembly staff member tests positive for coronavirus
.W
Maryland House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones’ office alerted members of the General Assembly on Sunday afternoon that a committee staff member has tested positive for the new coronavirus. In an email, Jones’ chief of staff, Alexandra M. Hughes, wrote that the speaker’s office received notice Sunday that a House committee staffer tested positive for the virus and is recovering. That staff member has not been at work since Monday, the letter said. Del. Kumar Barve, a Montgomery County Democrat, confirmed in an interview that the infected person is a member of the Environment and Transportation Committee staff, although he did not identify the person by name. Barve is chairman of that committee. Barve said the staff member primarily interacted with legislators, not the public, during the course of his or her work. In the five days leading up to the General Assembly’s adjournment last Wednesday, the State House and House and Senate office buildings were closed to the public. “I have spoken to all other members of my committee and my other staff, and everyone feels great,” Barve said, adding that the staff member who tested positive is also “feeling all better.” Hughes did not provide much detail in her letter to members of the General Assembly, a copy of which was obtained by The Baltimore Sun. Hughes did not immediately respond to request for comment. Hughes said in the letter that members of the “relevant committee have been informed" and state and local health officials are “reviewing any potential contacts and making appropriate notifications. If you are not contacted, please do not be alarmed." “Our advice from the Department of Health is that there is a very low risk to a broader group based on the current facts that we know,” Hughes wrote in the email. “We are notifying you out of an abundance of caution. “If you have concerns for your health, you should consult your physician and encourage your staff to do the same.” In Maryland, at least 244 cases have been confirmed, including 54 cases that were reported Sunday. Three people have died. Worldwide, more than 300,000 cases have been reported, including more than 14,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. The General Assembly adjourned Wednesday after cutting the annual session short for the first time since the Civil War. Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson agreed to end the typically 90-day session about three weeks early amid the global pandemic. Barve said in the waning days of the session, the General Assembly leadership evaluated the information at hand to make the best decisions possible. “This is a situation where you take it one hour at a time,” Barve said. “You listen to experts and you make your best judgment call based on that. The number one concern was the health of the members, the staff and the public.” No members of the General Assembly have reported testing positive for the virus. In the U.S. Congress, several members have confirmed cases, including Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican. Paul said Sunday that he feels healthy but is in quarantine after a positive test result. Jason Farley, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and an infectious disease-trained nurse epidemiologist, said that while he did not have specific information about the House Committee staff member, people who have possibly interacted with someone who has the virus should take specific steps. “Step One don’t panic. Step Two monitor your symptoms,” Farley said. Baltimore Sun reporters Pamela Wood and Luke Broadwater contributed to this article.

Maryland SPCA closing to public, sending shelter animals to foster homes, in response to coronavirus
.W
Citing the “welfare of our staff and community,” the Maryland SPCA has decided to close its facilities to the public on March 23 and temporarily suspend operations because of the coronavirus threat, the 150-year-old animal welfare organization announced March 21. “Rest assured, all shelter animals will be cared for during this temporary suspension,” Jim Pierce, executive director, said in a Facebook post and in an email. “We’ll be placing them in foster homes with our incredible volunteers and staff.” The announcement was also posted to the SPCA website, where it appeared under a “Critical COVID-19 Update” header. The post itself does not mention the coronavirus or the COVID-19 disease it causes. No adoptions, admissions, veterinary care or surgeries will be available during the closure at the SPCA’s facilities on Falls Road in Baltimore, Pierce said. “We are asking our staff to stay at home, with the exception of a small team of emergency response personnel who will provide very limited services,” Pierce said in the post. “Our hearts are with you, your families, and your pets during this unprecedented situation,” the post continues. “We look forward to resuming essential services as soon as possible. Stay healthy and safe.”

Why are liquor stores considered essential during Maryland’s coronavirus shutdown?
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan took the extraordinary step Monday of closing the state’s nonessential businesses in an attempt to the slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order, notably, does not apply to liquor stores, wineries, distilleries and other providers of alcoholic beverages. The decision to maintain the sale of liquor and alcohol could perhaps provide some respite to Maryland’s economy, which has stuttered under a series of state-level measures designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. While restaurants and bars can offer delivery and carry-out service, many employers have reduced staff while others have closed to safeguard their patrons and employees. The governor’s latest executive order went into effect at 5 p.m. Monday. Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot said in a statement the decision to keep beverage retailers open was economically driven and in step with the state’s decision to allow restaurants to remain open for delivery and carry-out. Franchot is both the state’s chief tax collector and the regulator of the alcohol, tobacco and fuel industries in Maryland. He considers himself a champion of the state’s growing craft beer industry. “Maryland’s craft beer, wine and spirits industries are three of our state’s most important manufacturing sectors, responsible for sustaining tens of thousands of jobs and generating hundreds of millions of dollars in employee wages, economic investment and tax revenues, which we need for important priorities,” Franchot said in the statement. When a brewery, winery or restaurant closes, the economic ecosystem of workers, suppliers and vendors collapses, he said. “It is particularly imperative that we do everything possible to keep all of these local, community-based businesses open during this time of devastation," Franchot said. “Money generated locally stays local.” But not every local government considers liquor “essential.” Some states, like Pennsylvania, have closed liquor stores and other distributors of alcohol altogether in an attempt to further slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, the contagious upper respiratory disease that has sickened more than 415,000 around the world and killed some 18,000 worldwide. In Denver, the mayor ordered liquor stores closed — only to reverse the decision later the same day after shoppers swarmed to stock up on beverages. Hogan’s order excluded essential or critical industries as defined by the federal government. The federal government’s definition of “essential” workers was published last week by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The agency’s guidance on the food and agriculture sectors was broad and designated workers employed by groceries, pharmacies and other retail that sells food and beverage products as “essential.” Agency officials called the list advisory and said it should not be considered a federal directive or standard. The qualification of liquor and alcohol services as essential might serve to prevent those with substance abuse disorders from seeking urgent medical attention, said Zach Snitzer, co-founder of Maryland Addiction Recovery Center. While the state may have been largely motivated by economic gains, the designation could prevent additional fatalities or emergency room visits, he said. “There was a lot of concern throughout the country, and also locally, that if they did not keep liquor stores open, what would be the fallout from that,” Snitzer said. “Some people will absolutely require medical attention and we’re trying not to overwhelm an overwhelmed healthcare system.” For those continuing to serve alcohol, the governor’s essential service qualification poses something of a catch-22, said Peter Chung, manager of Smitty’s Liquor Co. in Federal Hill. The neighborhood liquor store remains open and continues to experience heavy foot traffic, Chung said. “People are buying more than they usually would,” he said. “We’re helping people get on with this and give them an outlet, but, at the same time while everyone else is home, we’re still working.” Even though alcohol remains available, Chung said people should take seriously the social distancing element of the coronavirus outbreak. Federal Hill, home to many young adults, saw scores of patrons flood the streets during the weekend leading up to St. Patrick’s Day, which drew criticism from Hogan and other state officials who then ramped up social distancing enforcement measures. Elsewhere in Baltimore, cocktail rooms, distilleries and breweries offering carry-out service to customers have had to adjust to a new workflow. Ernst Valery, co-owner of the Upper Fells Point’s new Ministry of Brewing, said it took the brewery a couple of days to sort out its new process, in which customers order beer online for curbside pick-up as opposed to in the old converted church. Valery said the outbreak has highlighted fault lines within society between those in the hospitality and service industries and those who do not earn their wage from tips. “Self-quarantining is only an option for a small segment of our population,” Valery said. “It’s certainly a challenge for us, and there are a lot of industries out there where people can’t work from home.” Valery said the neighborhood brewery, which has been accustomed to large crowds and long lines since it opened about two months ago, has done its best to alter its business model to prevent patrons from congregating outside. While he thinks service workers should receive more financial help than what has been proposed by state and federal officials, he said he understands the thought process behind maintaining the availability of liquor, wine and beer during a crisis. “In times of pressure and and in times of fear, it helps take the edge off to be able to have a drink,” he said. Meanwhile, others have shut their doors indefinitely, urging their employees to apply for unemployment benefits to compensate for the lost earnings. Ron Furman, owner of Max’s Taphouse in Fells Point, was one of eight Fells Point bar and restaurant owners to preemptively close up shop earlier this month after Hogan signaled that the state would start enforcing bans on large gatherings. He said that while he personally felt uncomfortable continuing to run the neighborhood tavern during the coronavirus outbreak, he supports the idea of alcohol-related businesses qualifying as essential. “Remember Prohibition? People will find a way to get it regardless,” he said. Baltimore Sun reporter Pamela Wood contributed to this article.

University of Maryland Medical system ‘provider’ tests positive for coronavirus
.W
A “provider” for the University of Maryland Medical System has tested positive for the new coronavirus, system officials confirmed Monday. It was not immediately clear where the person was employed, nor whether the person was among the 44 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in Maryland on Monday. UMMS spokeswoman Lisa Clough declined to answer questions on the case “out of respect for the privacy of our employees and patients.” “In this instance, when an UMMS provider tested positive for COVID-19, we took immediate steps to investigate their exposure and followed protocols and guidelines issued by the CDC and MDH to ensure the safety of the provider and patients,” Clough said in a statement. Clough called the safety of medical staff, patients and the health care workforce a “top priority" and said UMMS anticipated clinical staff would have a higher risk of exposure, which can happen both inside and outside of its facilities. “Even with safeguards in place, our caregivers are taking all the necessary precautions to keep themselves and those in our care safe,” Clough said. “UMMS has deep gratitude for the sacrifices made each day by providers who deliver the highest quality patient and family centered care." Last week, a health care provider at Northwest Hospital in Randallstown and a patient at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore both tested positive for COVID-19. And a “provider” at Johns Hopkins Hospital also tested positive, the hospital confirmed March 14. The number of confirmed cases of the virus in Maryland jumped to 288 on Monday. Gov. Larry Hogan has ordered all non-essential businesses to close in the state, including retail stores that had been allowed to remain open.

Lax Max Lacrosse Tournament canceled due to coronavirus concerns
.W
The Lax Max Lacrosse Tournament, one of the larger recreational weekend events in Carroll County, was canceled as a result of continued health concerns associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Mike Snitzer, the Lax Max tournament and events director, announced this in an email sent to team coaches, managers and program administrators affiliated with the event on Tuesday. The tournament was scheduled to take place two weeks after the projected re-opening of the state in accordance with Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home order. The Pikesville-based tournament celebrated its 25th year in 2019, as well as its ninth straight year in Carroll County, and has hosted more than 6,000 teams from throughout the United States and Canada. It remains a regional qualifier for the IMG National Lacrosse Championship that takes place in November in Bradenton, Florida. Last year’s Lax Max event fielded 70 teams, mostly from the recreational level, according to the tournament’s website. The number of teams surpassed 120 in 2018 and has hosted up to 275 in the past. This decision is based on the current actions of the Maryland state government, the surrounding counties and the area youth lacrosse leagues, according to the email. Snitzer said if, in the near future, a concrete date could be secured, Lax Max would consider sponsoring an event if the interest was there. Lisa Carroll, the Carroll County Recreation and Parks Bureau Chief of Recreation, said the department is responsible for renting out field space for Lax Max and providing on-site assistance when necessary. “We like to see the tournament come to town because it brings people into Carroll County,” Carroll said. “It’s a nice little economic boost and it’s rare not to see it here. It’s disappointing.” All regular, in-person Carroll County Recreation and Parks sponsored programs and events including all recreation council activities have been canceled through June 30, according to the Carroll County government website. This includes events such as the Piney Run & Bear Branch Summer Nature Camps and Teens on the Go. Cabin rentals at Hashawha Environmental Center and pavilion rentals at all county parks have also been canceled. Full refunds will be processed for all programs and reservations canceled due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

A eulogy for competence amid coronavirus concerns | COMMENTARY
.W
Consider this a eulogy for competence. It’s an appreciation long overdue, but then, competence — the quality of being equal to the situation, of knowing what to do — was always easy to overlook. You learned to expect it, to take it for granted. Competence was not sexy. Another reason this eulogy is overdue is that the loss of competence — meaning federal government competence — is not recent. To the contrary, competence has been gone since January of 2017. But the events of the last week make this an especially appropriate time for a eulogy. Seldom has the absence of competence seemed more glaring. Seldom have we been able to draw such a direct line between that absence and threats to our physical and financial health. The mixed-up, mixed-messaging misadventures of the Trump regime as it struggled to frame a coherent response to the novel coronavirus threat was a master class in what happens in a post-competence world once a critical mass of voters decides that stupidity is authenticity and ignorance some form of native genius. It was frightening and yet perversely fascinating to watch. In a moment that cried out for a president to be presidential, you instead had Donald Trump, having previously assured us warm weather would dispatch the disease, lashing out at his favorite foils. "Fake News MSDNC" and CNN, he tweeted, are trying to create panic. In a press conference Wednesday, he leveled the same charge at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who have criticized his response to the threat. During that same press conference, Mr. Trump said Johns Hopkins University rates the United States “No. 1 for being prepared.” As proof, he held up a piece of paper with a chart printed on it. Trump likened the coronavirus to the flu and played down the threat it poses. “We really have done a very good job,” he said. Then he announced Vice President Pence would lead the response to the virus. Mr. Pence’s scientific acumen can perhaps be judged by his insistence that climate change is a “myth” and his claim in 2000 that “smoking doesn’t kill.” The markets, not surprisingly, were not reassured; they spent most of the week in free fall. Nor were health officials. In contrast to Mr. Trump’s litany of vague reassurances, the CDC — whose budget Mr.Trump wants to slash, by the way — said the stateside spread of the disease is “inevitable” and advised Americans to brace for “significant disruption.” “But we’re very, very ready for this,” said Mr. Trump. Yeah. Sure we are. Some have likened all this to the Bush administration's laggard response to Hurricane Katrina. But here's the thing: That failure was noteworthy precisely because it was unexpected, flying in the face of what you looked for from the federal government. But who among us didn't expect this? Who would've bet the farm that, in the face of a global crisis, the Trump regime would act with the coordinated precision of circus acrobats? No one, that's who. Circus clowns maybe, but acrobats? No. Some of us have spent the last few years pretending it doesn't matter, pretending you could indulge, normalize and make excuses for gross incompetence in the most powerful office in the world and there would be no impact, no price to pay. It was always a lie, always a triumph of ideology and agenda over common sense and as such, always destined to unravel. Now, perhaps, it does. We are teetering on the edge of pandemic, our lives and fortunes at stake. Competence has rarely been so dearly missed. Leonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald.

‘I think we’re ready’: Carroll Hospital prepares for coronavirus as testing has begun in Carroll County
.W
Carroll Hospital has begun preparations for possible outbreak of the novel coronavirus, joining the other hospitals in the LifeBridge system in restricting visitors, activating emergency operations plans and setting up triage tents outside the emergency department. This coronavirus causes a flu-like respiratory illness known as COVID-19, which as of Friday had resulted in 33 deaths in the United States out of more than 1,200 people who had tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The first Carroll County case of the coronavirus was announced Friday afternoon. “All the LifeBridge hospitals have activated their incident command teams, so we are actively managing the operation of the hospital as a disaster,” said Tom Jeffers, corporate director of emergency management for LifeBridge Health. “Not that we are in that position, but we want to make sure it’s already ramped up so if we should get a widespread outbreak in Westminster, we are ready to respond and take care of our community.” This decision was reached and the response underway well before Gov. Hogan on Thursday afternoon directed all hospitals to follow similar protocols. In a visual sign of the ramping up, anyone driving by Carroll Hospital as of Wednesday might have seen white tents set up outside the emergency department. These are triage tents to be used in the event that large numbers of people need to be screened for the coronavirus, according to Jeffers. “The intent of the tent is to cohort people we are testing and evaluating that are non-serious, don’t have any other medical complaint other than potential flu-like symptoms while we are testing them,” he said. “Obviously if we do have someone who is a potential COVID-19 patient that has other serious conditions, chest pain, shortness of breath, life-threatening kinds of conditions, they would not be in the tent, they would be inside in one of our negative pressure rooms.” The tents were not active as of Thursday, but are intended to be seen as a sign of preparedness by the community, according to Stephanie Reid, Carroll Hospital’s chief nursing officer. “We want to be ready if we need them, and we want the staff and our community to see that we are preparing if we need to use them. We actually did it as a reassurance,” she said. “We actually put our tent up last flu season. We didn’t have to use it, but we had it up and ready.” The hospital has been conducting tests for the coronavirus, according to Selena Brewer, director of marketing and public relations for Carroll Hospital, though it was not immediately clear how many tests have been conducted and for how long the hospital has been testing. The use of the tents and other preparations being made at Carroll Hospital are the result of lessons learned during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa of 2014-2016, when there were concerns of spread within the United States, according to Jeffers. “We were sort of ahead of the game with the whole Ebola crisis in that we created an infectious disease pod in one of our units that would be used for that purpose, and had our staff trained,” he said. “It’s just a matter of refreshing our staff on the donning and doffing of the personal protection equipment.” The hospital’s visitor policy was updated Wednesday to add the following policies: All visitors will be required to check in at a visitor information desk.  Visitors younger than age 18 will be prohibited, unless if they are the parent of a child in the hospital.  Visits will be restricted to one adult visitor per patient.  Visitors may be screened for flu-like symptoms, including runny nose, fever and cough, and will not be allowed to visit if symptoms persist.  Anyone who has traveled internationally may not visit for 14 days after returning to the United States. If and when there begin to be COVID-19 cases in Carroll County, Reid said, “I think we’re ready.” Testing for the virus According to Maggie Kunz, health planner with the Carroll County Health Department, it’s possible rumors might be swirling because commercial health laboratories such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics have begun offering COVID-19 testing. These services are different than testing done through the health department, which follows Centers For Disease and Prevention guidelines: people who were either hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, people older than 65 or people with chronic health conditions or symptomatic people who had traveled to a COVID-19 risk area or been exposed to a known COVID-19 case within 14 days. “The criteria to be tested at private labs is very different, just has to be approved by a physician, no need to follow CDC guidelines,” Kunz wrote in an email. While the Carroll County Health Department will be informed of any positive COVID-19 tests, Kunz said, it was not clear as of Thursday just how many people have been tested. The introduction of private testing has, however, been helpful to the public health response, according to Deputy Carroll County Health Officer Dr. Henry Taylor. “Allowing commercial lab testing removed a huge bottleneck,” he wrote in an email. “By sending to physicians and commercial labs, we can focus on transitioning from tracing contacts and cases towards building the capacity of the community to care for COVID-19.” It’s not clear just when such commercial COVID-19 testing became available in Carroll County, but an email auto-response from LabCorp’s media relations team, set due to the high volume of press inquiries, said the test first became available on March 5 and that LabCorp can now perform several thousand tests per day. Specimens for the LabCorp tests are collected at doctor’s offices and sent to LabCorp, and take around three to four days to get results, according to the company’s webpage. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the health department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 am. through 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. “For those people who do not meet the criteria to be tested through Maryland Department of Health, MDH recommends commercial testing first for influenza,” Kunz wrote in an email. “If that is negative, then a rapid viral panel and if that is negative for all pathogens, then test for COVID.” Kunz noted the announcement of any positive COVID-10 results would likely be handled by the office of Gov. Larry Hogan. Carroll County will cover co-pays for any county employees who need to be tested for the coronavirus, county administrator Roberta Windham said at the Board of County Commissioners meeting Thursday. As of 5 p.m. Thursday, the governor’s office had confirmed 12 COVID-19 cases in Maryland, with one case from Baltimore County, one from Harford County, six cases from Montgomery County and four cases from Prince George’s County. Hogan announced Thursday that one of those Prince George’s County cases is the first example of community transmission of the virus in Maryland. The patient, the governor tweeted, “had no known exposure to coronavirus through travel or an infected individual.” Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Baltimore crime during coronavirus: Property crime plummets, gun violence continues
.W
For five days after Baltimore’s mayor declared a state of emergency related to the coronavirus, the city didn’t record a single homicide. It seemed possible that concern over the pandemic might suppress the city’s longstanding plague of gun violence. The reprieve was short-lived. Since March 23, the city has seen 11 killings in 12 days, with at least 18 more people shot and wounded. That doesn’t include a man fatally shot by a police officer. March finished with 18 homicides, a number in line with what’s typically been recorded during the month in recent years. But the overall crime picture remains more complex. Total reported crime in Baltimore has indeed dipped, as have calls to 911, data show. Reported property crime is down considerably: Burglaries, larcenies and auto thefts have fallen each of the past three weeks, and have been cut in half compared with the same period last year. That is keeping with a trend reported in other cities where stay-at-home orders and general fears about the coronavirus have driven down crime. But Baltimore, like other cities, continues to see gunfire. After seven people were shot in one incident March 17, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young urged gunmen to stop shooting in order to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. Violent crime is declining, though some categories actually rose in the middle of the month. Baltimore has a persistent problem with robberies — U.S. Attorney William P. Barr in December called the city the “robbery capital” — and even a 21% week-over-week decline in that category still saw 64 robberies across the city for the week ending March 28. “It’s a very challenging arena,” Deputy Commissioner for Operations Michael Sullivan said in an interview. “We talk about changing the culture, and that culture of violence out there doesn’t change because of a pandemic.” The coronavirus effects that could be associated with reducing crime are also competing with factors that sometimes contribute to crime: skyrocketing joblessness, rising temperatures and children out of school. Coronavirus and stay-at-home orders have tamped down crime in New York, Chicago and St. Louis, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. He noted that Italy, devastated by the virus, has seen street crime plummet. “Crime conforms to activity patterns in the population. As routine activities are disrupted, crime rates change. Fewer people on the street means fewer targets for robbers and larcenists,” he said. “More people at home means lower rates of residential burglary because burglars tend to avoid occupied homes.” Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that while some of Baltimore’s violence might be attributed to the drug trade, it is often over simple beefs. In parts of the city, violence has become an accepted way to settle those disputes. “It’s a complex set of circumstances that lead to shootings,” he said. “The question will be: How much will they be interacting with one another? That’s a little less clear.” One of the most recent killings took place Thursday during morning rush hour in the parking lot of a Park Heights carryout. Days earlier, a sleeping family in Northwest Baltimore’s Cross Country neighborhood awoke around 3:30 a.m. to four masked gunmen demanding, “Where’s the money!” One man had climbed through an unlocked kitchen window and let the others in, according to a police report. They stole cash, cell phones and car keys. Sullivan, the deputy commissioner, said there’s been a citywide trend of such overnight home invasions. Arrests have plummeted as well. According to police data, there were 188 arrests during the week ending March 28, compared with 428 during the same period last year — a 58% drop. For the month, arrests were down 28% compared with the same period last year. “We’ve asked our officers to really weigh the actions they take, versus the public harm that is actually occurring out there,” Sullivan said. “We don’t want them to unnecessarily expose themselves, but we do need to engage and encourage social distancing.” Officers who spoke with The Sun say coronavirus concerns have them more reluctant than ever to engage on lesser crimes. Prosecutors lifted some of those pressures when they announced a moratorium on charges for low-level crimes such as drug possession and prostitution. A Baltimore police officer and two city firefighters already contracted the virus. Leaders of the police union have requested donations of hand sanitizer, face masks and gloves, saying the city and department leaders haven’t done enough to protect officers. One officer said that leads to a lack of enforcement. “I’m not going to let a handgun go or a robbery or a violent act against a person," said the patrol officer, who spoke to The Sun on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by the department to speak to the media. “But at the same time, I’m working in a city that hasn’t provided anything to protect us." Sullivan said officers “are still making arrests,” emphasizing detective units. “Our detectives and the men and women of the police department are working very hard to make sure that we hold people accountable, especially homicide, non-fatal shootings and robbery,” Sullivan said. But City Councilman Leon Pinkett, who represents West Baltimore, lamented that drug dealing has continued to thrive. Officials have observed dealers wearing surgical masks and gloves. Pinkett said he’s primarily concerned with overdoses from fentanyl-laced heroin. “In a pandemic or not, communities across the city continue to be held hostage by open air drug markets,” Pinkett said. “To the residents in the community [current enforcement efforts] are no different than what they were experiencing prior to COVID-19. There’s been a perception in my district that there is no enforcement, there is no prosecution for drug dealing." One notable success has been the department’s Western District, which is in the midst of an exceptional period of more than a month with just one non-fatal shooting and no homicides. That’s after the district saw the most homicides in the city the past two years, with 59 people killed in 2019 and 51 people killed in 2018, and began this year with 11 people killed through February. Police are trying to figure out how best to carry out Hogan’s stay-at-home order. In recent years, through the consent decree process, officers have been told not to break up groups of people who are not committing crimes in order to repair trust with the community. Instructions recently distributed to officers tell them to play a recorded message about dispersal over a PA system for up to 15 minutes. If the group fails to disperse, officers have been told to call a supervisor, activate their lights and sirens, and let the message play for another 15 minutes. And if they still don’t disperse? The Foxtrot helicopter is then supposed to fly overhead and make the same announcement. Even then, the department told its officers to avoid making contact with the individuals and to consider whether bringing charges is necessary “while balancing resource constraints and public harm.” On a recent morning at the corner of Saratoga and Eutaw streets, an officer sat in his cruiser with his lights flashing and windows rolled up, playing the message over the loudspeaker. Men in winter jackets and caps crammed the sidewalk; some hopped in and out of a nearby tavern. Money jumped from one set of ungloved hands to another. After about seven minutes, the officer turned the corner past two other groups, his message universally ignored. Sun reporters Tim Prudente and John Holland contributed to this article

Carroll County Health Department announces new coronavirus cases; hospital has tested more than 500 people
.W
The number of coronavirus cases in Carroll County nearly doubled overnight, and Carroll Hospital has tested more than 500 people for the disease, according to health department and hospital officials. Maggie Kunz, spokesperson for the Carroll County Health Department, said there are 10 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. In the morning of March 26, Kunz said there were “tentatively” 10 cases, as the health department was in the process of confirming positive results from various labs. By late afternoon, Kunz confirmed there are definitely 10 cases in Carroll. To date, Carroll Hospital has collected samples to be tested for COVID-19 from 531 individuals, of which 378 were obtained via drive-through tests, hospital spokesperson Selena Mowery wrote in an 11 a.m. email March 26. As of March 23, the hospital had collected 388 samples, 262 of which were obtained via drive-through testing. As part of 157 new cases statewide, Maryland officials confirmed Carroll’s seventh case Thursday morning, though it’s possible for that total to not be up to date with the latest information available to the county. The sixth case, a woman in her 20s, was announced Wednesday. The first two cases announced in Carroll County, a woman in her 30s and a man in his 40s who are related to each other, are expected to be deemed recovered from the coronavirus Friday, Kunz said. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, a person with COVID-19 directed to self-isolate at home may stop home isolation under the following conditions: At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and,  At least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared. Anyone feeling ill should contact their health care professional. Carroll County Health Department is operating a COVID-19 hotline, available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week, at 410-876-4848. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. All emergencies should continue to call 911. This story will be updated.

Maryland sees spike of 1,100 new coronavirus cases, but most hospitals aren’t yet at capacity
.W
Maryland saw its largest daily spike in new coronavirus cases Wednesday with more than 1,000 new confirmed cases announced, as the state’s hospitals brace for a rush of patients. The state announced an additional 1,158 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to at least 5,529 cases overall. The increase came after two consecutive days in which the number of new cases had been leveling off. There have been 124 deaths in Maryland from the virus, an increase of 21 from the total announced the day before. In a statement, Gov. Larry Hogan said 30% of the confirmed cases added Wednesday were for tests performed in March, attributing the increase in part to an uptick in testing volume and the process of commercial labs clearing their backlogs of tests. “This virus continues to spread in every jurisdiction, and as I have been saying for weeks, the Baltimore-Washington corridor has become an emerging hotspot,” Hogan said. "An increase in new infections is just one of the reasons for today’s significant jump in new cases. This is also due to our ongoing efforts to ramp up testing in Maryland, with more private labs coming onboard and the expansion of commercial lab capacity. “I want to once again remind all Marylanders to continue to stay home and stay informed. We are all in this together, and we will get through this together.” Pinar Keskinocak, the president of Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences in Catonsville and a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who specializes in infectious disease modeling, said in an email that spikes such as the one Maryland saw Wednesday are partially the result of a nationwide delay and deficit in testing. “The number of daily confirmed cases are likely to be severely below the actual number of infections,” Keskinocak said. “The daily variations — including dip and spikes — in the number of confirmed cases might be in part due to under-reporting and delays, or changes in social interactions, with the effects of these changes being reflected in the confirmed case numbers several days or weeks later.” As cases mount, the state’s hospitals are also preparing to handle more patients. An additional 104 hospitalizations because of the coronavirus were announced Wednesday, an uptick of nearly 10%. While 1,210 Marylanders in all have been hospitalized, 365 have been released from isolation. Bob Atlas, CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association, said the 26.5% jump in confirmed cases in the last 24 hours is “concerning” but hospitals remain able to handle the cases. “It may be what we’re seeing is better testing, more so than an actual change in the trajectory of the disease,” he said. “But we don’t know so we have to operate very conservatively. We have to assume the surge is becoming evident.” He cautioned against inferring much from a single day’s data because the number of new cases has jumped around some. Wednesday’s 1,158 additional cases are more than double the state’s previous single-day high for new cases and more than triple the 326 cases added Tuesday. The state also announced 5,677 new negative tests Wednesday, its most single-day negative test results since the state began reporting those numbers March 28. It will take a while to understand when the cases have peaked, which means new cases will begin to drop. "We can’t determine a trend from a single day,” Atlas said. He said the University of Maryland Medical System, MedStar Health, LifeBridge Health and Johns Hopkins Medicine are all coordinating patients within their systems, as well as with state health and emergency management officials. That will help keep hospitals, including those closer to Washington, from becoming overloaded. However, hospitals across the state are ramping up capacity within their walls and inside about 100 specialized tents that are on their way to the state. They are separate from triage tents that are serving people who arrive at the hospitals for care. There also are two new hospital facilities in the works to accommodate hundreds of patients, one inside the Baltimore Convention Center and another at a shuttered hospital in Laurel. “We are getting close to full capacity, if you consider what’s normal capacity, in a couple of places,” Atlas said. “But they are not overflowing yet. ... So it’s not the level of infection that leads to the kinds of news stories you see in New York. We hope not to get there.” During a Zoom presentation to members of the Greater Baltimore Committee on Wednesday, the president of the Johns Hopkins Health System said Hopkins has confirmed 1,048 cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, with 186 patients in the hospital system as of Wednesday morning. Of those, 20% percent are on ventilators, which Kevin Sowers called a typical statistic in the U.S. and elsewhere. But “we have not met our surge,” he told the business organization. As the hospital attempts to create surge capacity and support social distancing, outpatient visits are down by 60%, Sowers said, with strict visitation policies put in place. Telemedicine visits have ballooned from eight patients a day to more than 1,200. “Out of something really horrific that is happening in our world, this will also force us to look at ways that we can change and become better at delivering health care services to our communities” in the future, Sowers said. Dr. Brian Garibaldi, director of the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit, said the hospital was taking some of the sickest patients from the more heavily hit Washington suburbs. The hospital has added multiple ICU units to treat COVID-19 patients and has staff that has trained for years for such a pandemic. Garibaldi said there have been about 100 ICU patients in recent weeks with close to 40 now. Many more are being treated outside of the ICUs. “We’re not overwhelmed," Garibaldi said, "but we certainly are very, very busy and it’s no longer business as usual.” Baltimore Sun reporter Lorraine Mirabella contributed to this article.

Carroll County shutters senior centers to reduce risk of coronavirus spread, though no cases found
.W
Carroll County’s five senior centers closed at 11:30 Thursday morning after being directed by the state to do so as a precautionary measure designed to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus also know by the disease it causes, COVID-19. Celene Steckel, director of citizen services, and Jeff Degitz, director of recreation and parks, made the announcement just before noon at the Board of County Commissioners meeting Thursday. “This closure is the result of an order from the state of Maryland as a precaution to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19," Steckel said. Although there have been no cases of the coronavirus found in Carroll County as of Thursday, Steckel said the health and safety of senior citizens is a priority. A total of 12 cases have so far been confirmed in the state. Gov. Larry Hogan announced a number of sweeping directives Thursday, including closures of senior centers and schools. As a result, all activities associated with the Carroll senior centers, including those conducted by outside groups or the county Department of Recreation and Parks, have been canceled, Steckel said. However, Steckel said in an email Thursday evening that staff at the senior centers will continue working through phone and email, calling senior center members “periodically during the center closure to assess if the members have access to food, an adequate supply of medications or any other emergent needs.” She reiterated that the Bureau of Aging and Disabilities office, at 125 Stoner Ave. in Westminster, remains open. Anyone with senior citizen needs can call the office at 410-386-3800. “Older adults remain a priority for us and we will continue to serve them, just in a different way during the center closure," Steckel said in the email. “Members were offered shelf stable emergency meal kits prior to the center closures.” She also said center staff are prepared to provide access to food for any senior center members who report an inability to get food. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the health department’s has a COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 am. through 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. Those calling outside those hours can leave a message or call the Maryland 211 line. Hogan announced Thursday that one of those Prince George’s County cases is the first example of community transmission of the virus in Maryland. The patient, the governor tweeted, “had no known exposure to coronavirus through travel or an infected individual.” Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/. As of Thursday morning the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization deemed a pandemic Wednesday, had resulted in 40 deaths in the United States out of almost 1,600 people who had tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Carroll Hospital tightens policy in response to coronavirus, allowing no visitors, with some exceptions
.W
In an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, LifeBridge Health facilities including Carroll Hospital are tightening their visitor policies. Effective March 25, according to a LifeBridge news release, Carroll Hospital is not allowing inpatient visitors with the following exceptions: • One parent visitor for pediatric patients. • One significant other for labor and delivery patients. • One visitor for end-of-life care patients. • One visitor for heart attack or stroke patients. • One visitor for emergency surgery patients. These changes also affect Sinai Hospital, Northwest Hospital and Grace Medical Center. All of the exempted visitors will be required to wear a surgical mask. There is one designated visitor per patient, not just one visitor at a time. There will be no visitors for patients who are considered “under investigation” for COVID-19. Emergency Department (ED) visitation policy is one visitor per patient, and visitors for patients in the Emergency Department will be screened. ED visitors will not be required to wear masks, though ED patients will be required to wear surgical masks. “We appreciate that these visitor restrictions may be challenging for patients and families. However, given the rapid spread of COVID-19, we made this decision about visitors in the best interest of our patients, their families, our staff and our community,” the release said.

As states ease restrictions, Hopkins expert forecasts ‘waves’ of new coronavirus cases through summer and fall
.W
As some states begin lifting coronavirus safety restrictions, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security says he worries the country will see waves of new COVID-19 cases through summer and fall. Tom Inglesby appeared Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” to discuss realistic timelines for easing social distancing and the limitations of data on coronavirus cases. The director is one of the doctors advising Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on his coronavirus task force. While some states like Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska are easing shutdowns, Inglesby said officials should remember that the virus is still highly transmissible. “Nothing has changed in the underlying dynamics of this virus,” he said. “If we stop social distancing altogether tomorrow, we would recreate the conditions that existed in the country in February and March.” Inglesby forecast “waves” of new coronavirus cases throughout summer. And the fall season, he said, will likely bring additional challenges to battling coronavirus including the reemergence of influenza. “We’re going to have two concurrent large public health challenges at the same time,” Inglesby said. “I am worried about the uptick in hospitalization rate and the more people needing intensive care in the fall.” Maryland has confirmed 25,642 total cases of COVID-19 and 1,182 related fatalities. Sunday marked the second straight day of declining figures for hospitalizations, which state officials have said are a key factor in determining when to relax social distancing guidelines, travel restrictions and allow businesses across the state to reopen. To date, Maryland has seen 107,300 coronavirus tests come back negative. Inglesby called the country’s access to coronavirus testing and operations a “patchwork." Some states have tested enough people for coronavirus that its percentage of positive cases is low. Other states have a high percentage of people testing positive and that’s worrisome, Inglesby said. In the coming months, the country will need to better understand the number of mild and moderate cases of the coronavirus, he explained to “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd. “If we don’t know who they are, then we can’t break their chains of transmission,” Inglesby said. "We can’t isolate them. We can’t quarantine their contacts. So we need to know much more about the mild and moderate illnesses around the country and that will come with more diagnostic testing.” States and individuals will still need to continue social distancing efforts such as maintaining six feet distance from others, wearing masks when in public and avoiding large gatherings. “The extent to which we’re able to do that over the next couple of months will dictate how we do as states and as a country,” Inglesby said of social distancing. Inglesby rose to public prominence in March after he penned a viral Twitter thread that was critical of President Donald Trump’s desire to walk back social distancing measures. He is also a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the school of medicine, according to an online biography. Baltimore Sun reporters Phil Davis, McKenna Oxenden and Daniel Oyefusi contributed to this article.

Thousands enroll in insurance under threat from coronavirus
.W
Maryland has signed up nearly 5,000 people for health insurance in the past week during a special enrollment period for its online exchange, according to the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. The enrollment period, which lasts through April 15, was created in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of Marylanders already have tested positive for the virus. The exchange was created under the federal Affordable Care Act, which just reached its 10th anniversary. It aimed to cover people who were not covered through their job or a government program. About 6% of Marylanders, or about 300,000 people, were uninsured before this year’s annual enrollment and state officials wanted to give those who qualify another chance to sign up as the outbreak sweeps the state and the nation. Others may have lost their jobs because due to business closures aimed at slowing the rate of coronavirus infection. To help people afford the coverage, most people on the exchange receive subsidies. Others qualify for Medicaid, the government health program for the poor. A new state program this year also allowed Marylanders to get information on enrolling by checking a box on their taxes. After emergency orders from the state and cooperation from insurers, many plans now cover the costs of coronavirus testing and afford consumers other benefits such as access to extra doses of their prescriptions. For information or to sign up, go to MarylandHealthConnection.gov.

2 coronavirus cases found at Mount Airy nursing home, bringing total confirmed in Carroll County to 14
.W
Two residents of a Mount Airy nursing home have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and more than 60 other residents are awaiting test results, according to a county health department news release. The residents with COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, are women in their 50s at Pleasant View Nursing Home, in Carroll County, the Friday night release reads. They have been hospitalized. All residents and staff with symptoms have been tested and the staff with symptoms are isolating at home, according to Maggie Kunz, spokesperson for Carroll County Health Department. Residents with symptoms are being isolated at the nursing home, Kunz said. There have been 14 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Carroll County, including these cases, Kunz said the evening of March 27. Nursing homes are considered high-risk locations for the coronavirus, which is generally more dangerous for older adults and people with existing health problems. In Washington state, where as of Friday night 175 people had died from the coronavirus, at least 37 of those deaths have been linked to one nursing home, according to the Associated Press. Rebecca Travels, administrator of the nursing home, said one woman was tested last week at Carroll Hospital and one was tested a few days ago at the nursing home, likely Wednesday when they gained the ability to collect samples themselves. Pleasant View Nursing Home has been in operation for about 46 years, Travels said. It is a long-term care facility that offers acute rehab services; occupational, physical and speech therapy; mental health services; comprehensive medical management; daily support for activities; and more. Travels said the two women who tested positive had underlying health conditions. To her knowledge, they did not have any known contact with someone who has COVID-19. “Residents in long-term care facilities, generally, by definition have underlying health conditions,” she said. With this in mind, Travels said staff has done everything they can to prevent the spread of the disease. “I really truly believe that the facility did everything that it possibly could to prevent this from happening,” Travels said. “We will continue to work tirelessly, day and night, for as long as we need to in order to prevent further spread and to take really good care of the residents that we have here.” She said they did this by “immediately” following Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines and Gov. Larry Hogan’s executive orders. CMS licenses most nursing homes across the country, Travels said. They’ve followed the governor’s restrictions to limit visitors so family can only visit during “end of life” situations, she said, and they’ve ceased communal dining and other group activities as the orders were issued. Staff at Pleasant View have been checking residents for symptoms regularly and, when they were found, first performed tests for other illnesses, such as the flu, to rule them out according to Travels, in accordance with CMS guidelines. Travels felt they had decent supplies to handle the situation and were assisted by the Carroll County Health Department. Staffers have used disinfectant and personal protective equipment such as gowns and masks. The staff has often reminded residents to stay six feet apart and to practice proper hygiene, she said. “We are a very compassionate company,” Travels said. “We are family owned and operated. These residents are our family.” Ed Singer, county health officer, and Deanna Najera, physician assistant-certified, a clinical consultant to the health department, visited the facility March 27 to observe infection control measures put in place to mitigate the spread of infection between staff and patients, the release states. “Pleasant View Nursing Home is cooperating with and following the guidance of the Maryland Department of Health and the Carroll County Health Department,” Singer said in the release. “Their staff is working diligently and putting patients first. They have been open and transparent with their residents and families and are doing a great job taking care of their patients during this challenging time.” The nursing home provided the health department with documentation detailing “extensive” actions taken to prevent the spread of infection starting March 10, following guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and Hogan’s executive orders, according to the release. “Actions included extra cleaning, restricted visitation policies, restricted communal dining, suspended group activities, and daily checks of staff and residents for symptoms and follow up actions to isolate anyone who was ill. They also implemented activities to keep residents engaged while remaining in their rooms and offered video chats to help residents stay connected with their families,” the release reads. The facility has 104 beds, according to the Maryland Health Care Commission. “In my opinion, they’ve probably done everything they should have done,” Singer said in an interview. “I think the nursing home did everything they could.” In the release, Singer encouraged Maryland Responds volunteers to provide additional support. “In situations like this, Maryland Responds volunteers can help provide additional support and care. Individuals with medical training who want to volunteer can sign up at https://mdr.health.maryland.gov/Pages/Home.aspx; there are also roles for non-medical volunteers,” Singer said. Eleven of the Carroll countians who have contracted COVID-19 are women, Kunz said. Three of the cases were found in men. The first three people found to have COVID-19 in the county are now considered to be recovered, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Kunz said, leaving Carroll with 11 active cases. The first three patients were a man in his 40s, a woman in her 30s and a man in his 20s. The first confirmed case in Carroll was announced March 13. While older people have been identified as a group that is vulnerable to the disease, most of the cases in Carroll County have been found in younger people. Of the cases confirmed in Carroll — counting those now considered to be recovered — five people are in their 20s, one is in their 30s, four are in their 40s, two are in their 50s and one is in their 60s, according to Kunz; one person’s age has not been made available yet. “There have been some serious illnesses in younger people across the state,” Kunz said. “Probably people in older age groups are taking more precautions.” Of the 774 cases the state has confirmed, 568 were people younger than age 60, according to the state. According to the CDC guidelines, a person with COVID-19 directed to self-isolate at home may stop home isolation under the following conditions: At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath).  At least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared. Kunz predicts the numbers will rise as testing capability increases. “We have been able to test more, and people are more aware,” Kunz said. "We’re probably catching more cases that aren’t as serious.” For at least two weeks now, the goal of Carroll County Health Department has been to slow the spread — not stop it — because stopping it is not a viable option at this stage, Kunz said. By slowing the spread, health care providers will gain time to prepare, she said. Anyone feeling ill should contact their health care professional. Carroll County Health Department is operating a COVID-19 hotline, available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week, at 410-876-4848. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. All emergencies should continue to call 911.

Maryland Department of Juvenile Services reports first coronavirus case
.W
The Maryland Department of Juvenile Services reported Monday its first positive case of coronavirus in a staff member, state officials confirmed. The department was notified Sunday that a staff member working at the Lower Eastern Shore Children’s Center in Salisbury tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, according to department a news release. The employee last worked at the facility March 27 and has quarantined since then. Staff at Lower Eastern Shore Children’s Center are working with the DJS medical director and state and local health departments to “ensure that all appropriate measures are taken,” the release state. Some of the measures include that all staff and youth are required to wear protective masks. Each youth newly admitted to DJS custody must undergo a medical evaluation during intake and are housed separately until he or she has been monitored for COVID-19 related symptoms and cleared. Those who were in contact with the worker are quarantining, with further tests ordered. Employees who display symptoms or test positive must be medically cleared to return to work, the release states. Facility entry is also being limited to essential personnel, with all persons entering DJS buildings completing a medical screening and temperature check. DJS and the Maryland Department of Education have maintained education services to date, but are planning to transition to a distance learning model, the release states.

Five coronavirus cases confirmed at Baltimore’s Levindale hospital, official says
.W
Fives cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed at Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center and Hospital. The diagnosed cases of COVID-19 were found in both staff and patients of the long-term care and specialty hospital in Northwest Baltimore. Additional test results are pending, city health commissioner Letitia Dzirasa said Wednesday. LifeBridge Health, the hospital network that owns Levindale, said one patient in the specialty hospital, three patients in the sub-acute rehab unit and one staff member have tested positive for the virus. The staffer is recovering at home in quarantine. There are no positive COVID-19 cases in residents of the long-term care facility. Levindale stopped allowing visitors to the facility March 10 and began screening employees and taking their temperatures as they reported to work in early March. The hospital system is working with infection prevention teams and following federal and Maryland Department of Health guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19, spokeswoman Sharon Boston said in a statement. “The care and safety of our patients, residents and staff is always our top priority," Boston said. Levindale offers several types of care, including a long-term residential facility, sub-acute rehabilitation and a specialty hospital, which includes a high-intensity care unit.

Preakness InfieldFest canceled amid coronavirus concerns; race date still unknown
.W
While the date of this year’s second leg of horseracing’s Triple Crown remains unknown, the 145th running of the Preakness Stakes will not feature InfieldFest at Pimlico Race Course. The Stronach Group and the Maryland Jockey Club made the announcement Friday that InfieldFest 2020 will be canceled, regardless of when the race occurs. The event is planned to return in 2021. The Kentucky Derby, which precedes the Preakness in the Triple Crown, has already been postponed to Sept. 5 because of concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic. “InfieldFest is a vibrant and cherished event for Baltimore City that brings together thousands of fans for legendary performances, unique hospitality and curated activations during the historic Preakness Stakes,” a statement read. “This was a difficult decision but we are confident that it was the right one. We look forward to celebrating InfieldFest 2021 next year.” InfieldFest’s 2020 lineup included Marshmallow, DaBaby and Quinn XCII, among other performers. Fans with tickets to InfieldFest 2020 will be able to receive a full refund or exchange their tickets for tickets to InfieldFest 2021 or seated tickets to Preakness 145.

‘The next best thing’: With wedding disrupted by coronavirus, couple livestreams ceremony from Ellicott City
.W
Nicole Terwilliger and Chris Castellano’s hopes of hosting hundreds of their family members and friends for their May 2 wedding dimmed with each step Maryland officials took to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The couple worried as the number of confirmed cases in Maryland grew and the initial restriction limiting gatherings to no more than 250 people — leaving their guest list intact — was revised to no more than 50, before the limit was later lowered to no more than 10. Terwilliger and Castellano didn’t want to wait more than a month until their wedding day to find out whether Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan might order the public to shelter in place, as officials elsewhere have done, and force the wedding to be postponed, the groom said in a phone interview. “I didn’t want to get to a point where we actually couldn’t get married,” said Castellano, 30, who grew up in Montgomery County and is moving into a new home with Terwilliger in Columbia. “The continual waiting was making it even more stressful. ... I didn’t want to shelter in place without her.” On Saturday, the couple exchanged vows in front of a pared-down guest list — their parents, the matron of honor, the best man, the priest, a pianist and a photographer — and livestreamed the Catholic wedding Mass at Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ellicott City so hundreds of their loved ones and the public could watch from home. The live-streamed wedding offered another indication of the far-reaching effects of the global coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than a 650,000 people with the COVID-19 illness and killed more than 30,000. In Maryland, more than 1,000 were known to have contracted the acute respiratory disease and 10 had died as of Saturday. As viewers tuned into the wedding from parts of Maryland, Michigan, Virginia, Indiana and even Belize, the Rev. William Garrott quoted from Charles Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities” and spoke about Pope Francis praying through the pouring rain in an eerily empty St. Peter’s Square the day before. “I can’t say if this is the best or worst of times,” Garrott said. “But I can say it is certainly the strangest of times.” The pope on Friday compared the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 10,000 in Italy alone, to an “unexpected, turbulent storm,” putting all of humanity in the same boat, Garrott said. Garrott highlighted some of the sacrifices the circumstances required of the couple, including the fewer guests and earlier wedding date. A planned 200-person reception at Savage Mill couldn’t happen, of course, so they picked up Greek food instead, Castellano said. Their parents met Friday at a small gathering over a salmon and asparagus stir-fry prepared by Terwilliger’s mother, instead of a planned 50-person rehearsal dinner at Stella Notte. “You had to strip away all of those normal accouterments,” the priest told the couple during the ceremony. “And yet here you are, ready to set sail in the midst of the storm. You can sail through that storm because the most important thing has not been trimmed away, the fact that you know the Lord. ... You know Him, and you know He is your helper, and you will not be afraid.” Terwilliger and Castellano had been engaged since May and picked the scripture readings for their wedding long before they knew about all the adjustments they would have to make, the priest said. The second reading, from the Letter to the Hebrews, emphasizes hospitality and being mindful of prisoners “as if sharing their imprisonment.” An otherwise unusual selection for a wedding, it fit the occasion perfectly, Garrott said. “Most of your invited guests are imprisoned in their homes right now,” he said. “But you have not neglected hospitality. You have shared their imprisonment as if it were your own. You wish they were here, but you’ve done the next best thing. You are making available a live-stream feed of this very nuptial Mass. And I think that’s awesome.” Castellano’s wedding ring was imprisoned, too, at the Zales in the Mall in Columbia, which closed before he could get it, forcing him to buy a silicon ring to use as a placeholder for the ceremony, he said. The Airbnb where the couple planned to spend a week-long honeymoon in Bar Harbor, Maine, visiting Acadia National Park, canceled their reservation, Castellano said, so they’ll have to figure out alternate plans. But no disappointment showed in the live-stream as the glowing couple exchanged “I dos,” smiles, and their first kiss as husband and wife. Their similar experiences in faith, honesty with one another, a mutual love of hiking and long walks in old neighborhoods — and a fateful match on CatholicMatch, an online dating site — helped bring the couple together, the groom said. They were both disappointed to forgo the fanfare of a traditional wedding, but “what’s most important is we wanted to be married and make that committed covenant to one another,” Castellano said. Live-streaming the wedding seemed like a great way to give the rest of their friends and family — and anyone else who need might need a pick-me-up — the chance to witness the happiest day of Terwilliger and Castellano’s lives. “A lot of people are cooped up,” the groom said. “It could give them hope during a trying time and allow them to experience something joyful, the virtual way. ... We can have a party later.”

‘I’m just so scared’: As more Marylanders seek coronavirus tests, shortage of kits rattles the sick 
.W
Parenting during a sudden school closure presents enough challenges for working mothers and fathers — even without a global pandemic. But so it goes for Fanya O’Donoghue, a mom to four boys, who began coughing last week and contracted a fever, a sore throat and other symptoms that doctors and medical experts say are typical of COVID-19, the illness associated with the new coronavirus. The Baltimore County resident has tried to maintain a sense of normalcy in her household even as she awaits the test results, a process her doctors said could take five days or more. The suspense, she said, has left her in a quiet state of agony as she tries to balance caring for herself and parenting her boys at a distance with the help of her husband. “Our response time should be quicker,” O’Donoghue said. “We’re supposed to be the most powerful country in the world, but people are dying for information.” O’Donoghue, however, also recognizes her luck. After all, she got a test, while many others have unsuccessfully implored their healthcare providers for the same — only to be denied. The shortage of testing kits — and the lag time between taking the tests and getting the results — has alarmed and frustrated dozens of Marylanders, many who have tried to get themselves or their loved ones swabbed for the coronavirus to no avail or who have been cast into states of uncertainty. A nationwide shortage of tests means only some will know if they are carriers of the highly contagious upper respiratory disease that has infected more than 250,000 people around the world and killed more than 10,000, numbers that will certainly rise as testing ramps up, experts say. In Maryland, three people have died from the coronavirus, and more than 200 have tested positive for it as of Sunday. After initially reporting how may tests it was conducting, the state stopped last week. Gov. Larry Hogan has said he’s pushing the federal government to supply more testing resources. Without sufficient testing kits, more cases likely exist than those that have been confirmed. “Testing for COVID-19 continues to be a challenge in Maryland, as it is across the nation,” said Charles Gischlar, a state health department spokesman. “Private/commercial labs and medical institutions are coming online and accelerating testing, which helps to improve statewide testing capacities.” Not everyone needs to be tested, Gischlar said. Testing is needed for people with symptoms, those over 60 and those with underlying health conditions because they’re most at risk, he said. Still, test anxiety has rattled state residents of all ages, backgrounds and health profiles, who say the state has not coordinated with medical systems and patients well enough. Some said their primary care physicians have been overwhelmed with testing requests from patients and have been given insufficient guidance about where to refer them for testing. Others said they’ve been told they did not qualify for tests because their symptoms or health background did not match the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s patient profile or because doctors have to save kits for their staffs. “No one knew what to do or what the protocol was,” said Martha Connolly, 66, who got tested for the coronavirus after spending several days looking into where she could go. “They said, ‘we’re holding off for high risk people.’ But if you’re not looking into community spread, how do you know for sure who’s at risk?” “People still not being able to be tested and in the meantime exposing lots of other people — I feel that’s crazy,” added Felicia Lovelett, 65, whose coronavirus test came back negative Wednesday. “A lot of people are really frightened.” Some 80% of patients recover on their own, though no treatment regimen or vaccine yet exists. But some cases, especially among those more at risk, become severe, progressing into difficulty breathing and even pneumonia. Experts and healthcare professionals said the ability to test allows researchers to more accurately track and understand the new virus and its traits, including those most susceptible to it and how it spreads. And yet, public officials have said the infirm should worry less about getting a test and focus instead on social distancing measures. As more testing kits become available, some said they hope healthcare providers lower the testing standards. Baltimore City resident Lucas Moten said he attempted to get tested in February at ExpressCare in Overlea but was told tests were reserved for people who had traveled from China or had been in contact with someone who had tested positive for it. ExpressCare is a LifeBridge Health partner. And Jason Raysor, a single parent of four, said his cough is severe and continues to get worse, but healthcare professionals at Kaiser Permanente initially refused to test him because he had not recently traveled internationally, been on a cruise ship or could prove he had come into contact with someone who had tested positive. He was approved for testing Thursday. “I’m just so scared. I thought I was going to die,” the 37-year-old Baltimore County resident said. “I don’t know how the elderly or people with compromised immune systems can handle this.” Machelle Behzadi, Kaiser Permanente’s vice president of quality and safety and chief nursing executive, said the health provider remains focused on patient, staff and community well-being. Infectious disease doctors review the medical profiles of all patients who request testing, she said, to determine whether a person’s symptoms match the CDC’s algorithm. “We’re ordering quite a significant number of tests,” she said. “There are not a lot of tests available, so we want to make sure we are testing people who are moderate to high risk.” Raysor said he has quarantined himself and his children but worries that others who have not been tested, especially those without symptoms, will continue to spread the virus to vulnerable persons. Other Marylanders, who have been tested, said the process is convoluted and needs to be reevaluated. O’Donoghue, for example, said she spent all of last weekend figuring out where she could get tested since her primary care physician did not know. Eventually, she decided to show up at a drive-through testing site that opened Monday at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore. Those who arrive at drive-through testing sites must first obtain a doctor’s referral and then register in the state’s COVID-19 testing system via a hotline. O’Donoghue spent hours trying to get through to the hotline only to encounter a busy signal on the other end. “I sat in the parking lot with the car off, calling this number, coughing the whole time, trying to get through,” she said. "They can hear me coughing from outside the car window. I was like, ‘Are they going to turn me away when I’m sounding like this?’ ” Eventually, with the help of Sinai staffers, O’Donoghue got through to the hotline and registered with the system. Nurses tested her through the car window, instructing her to tilt the seat back so they could swab up her nose. “They went so far back I’m sure they touched my brain,” she said. Meanwhile, Sinai staffers bent their fingers into heart shapes and made signs of the cross for O’Donoghue on the other side of the window. “It gave me goosebumps,” she said. “They were so amazing.” Dr. Jonathan Thierman, chief medical information officer at LifeBridge Health, said hospitals such as Sinai are adjusting to skyrocketing demand and are tightening their processes each day to make testing more efficient. He said LifeBridge has increased its staff and is working with LabCorp to reduce the lag time between when patients are tested and when they get their results. “We’ve been ‘in business’ a week with this operation,” he said. “Call volumes have steadily risen but are flattening out now to around 600 calls a day. We’re in pretty good shape.” While O’Donoghue said she has started to turn the corner, she frets about her mother, who had an aortic valve replaced a few weeks ago. She hasn’t seen her in since she developed her symptoms. Aside from the physical discomfort, she said, that’s been the hardest part.

18 people test positive for coronavirus at Spring Grove Hospital in Catonsville
.W
Ten patients and eight staff members have tested positive for coronavirus at Spring Grove Hospital Center in Catonsville, state health officials confirmed. The Maryland Department of Health is coordinating efforts with the Baltimore County Department of Health to contain the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, to others in the psychiatric care facility. The facility’s 366 patients are self-isolating in single occupancy rooms, said Charlie Gischlar, spokesman for the health department. Gischlar would not disclose information about the patients who have tested positive for the virus, citing health department policies, or how many are being tested. He added that the facility has “adequate supplies of [personal protective equipment] and sanitation supplies.” One week ago, health officials reported that two patients and seven staff members were confirmed to have contracted the respiratory illness. The southwest area has been the hardest hit in Baltimore County, particularly in Randallstown where 173 cases have been confirmed, according to state health department data on Baltimore County’s COVID-19 dashboard. The 21228 ZIP code in Catonsville contains the third-highest concentration of coronavirus cases in Baltimore County, with 155 confirmed cases as of Thursday. Countywide, more than 100 new cases were confirmed between Wednesday and Thursday, with 2,132 total cases and 62 deaths since the pandemic began sweeping through Maryland, according to state data.

Community Voices (Roemer): What the coronavirus is teaching our schools
.W
No one knows when schools will re-open, and while there are students and families who have the resources and discipline to make distance learning work, many don’t. Likewise, there are teachers who have the know-how to provide quality instruction remotely, but for many that’s a bridge too far, irrespective of the crash training they may be receiving at the moment. It’s simply not a skill set Carroll County Public Schools (CCPS) teachers have ever been required to possess. Everyone at CCPS is doing the best they can under difficult circumstances, but we need to be honest about the outcomes we should expect. I think it’s fair to assume most students will not achieve the same learning outcomes they would have achieved had the school year not been interrupted by the Cornavirus. That fact may have a longer lasting impact than we realize. Failing to master math concepts, for example, can plague students for years. In math, you’ve got to learn “A” before you can do “B”, and you’ve got to learn “B” before you can do “C”.  Miss any step along the way and future instruction becomes far more problematic. Questions about grades, graduation requirements and the like will be answered soon enough by the state officials who make those kinds of decisions, but the fact remains, students are missing thousands of hours of instruction and that’s something teachers are going to need to address when school eventually resumes. Hopefully, CCPS is planning now for how it will remediate the learning gaps students are sure to bring with them when the new school year begins in August. Beyond that, the school system needs to figure out how it will address the long-term capacity of its teachers to provide quality instruction remotely. Current circumstances have demonstrated clearly that’s a competence which can no longer be considered a luxury. It needs to be an ongoing skill development priority for the school system, not only so it’s prepared for the next crisis that closes schools, but because in the 21st century, it’s how students learn. And for those teachers who have worked hard — mostly on their own — developing the skills they need to provide instruction remotely, unfortunately they face an onerous list of restrictions which deny them access to far too many online tools. Whether these bureaucratic restraints are really necessary is something the school system needs to take a close look at. Taking the time and effort to train educators how to teach remotely only to deny them access to the tools the need to apply those skills seems a little silly. The coronavirus is causing society to reexamine how a whole host of things get done, how we educate our children and prepare our teachers for that supremely important task among them. Chris Roemer writes from Finksburg.

Tenth resident of Pleasant View Nursing Home dies of coronavirus
.W
A man in his 80s who had been a resident at Pleasant View Nursing Home has died due to COVID-19, the Carroll County Health Department announced Sunday. He is the 10th resident of the Mount Airy nursing home who has succumbed since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Additionally, three more Pleasant View staff members tested positive, making 27 staff members who have tested positive. The Carroll County Health Department also announced five additional COVID-19 cases in residents at Carroll Lutheran Village, a retirement community in Westminster. Two women in their 70s, a man in his 70s, a woman in her 80s, and a woman in her 90s bring to 12 the number of positive tests among CLV residents, as well as two staffers. The Health Department had announced on Saturday the first fatality of a Carroll Lutheran resident, a woman in her 90s. Also on Sunday, the Health Department announced one additional community case of COVID-19 in Carroll County: a woman in her 30s. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Baltimore City Fire Department says 11 employees tested positive for coronavirus, two others are in quarantine 
.W
The Baltimore City Fire Department said Monday night that 11 employees have tested positive for the coronavirus. In a memo sent by department spokeswoman Blair Adams, Fire Chief Niles R. Ford said that as of Saturday, two other employees are in quarantine. If the two individuals quarantined don’t experience symptoms, Ford said, they will return to work Tuesday. The department, however, cautioned in the memo, that the numbers may not be accurate. “The Baltimore City Fire Department does not have accurate information as to the number of employees who have been tested for COVID-19 because our members generally are tested through their primary care physicians, if they become symptomatic,” Ford said. Every shift, 44 people work at the same location as the COVID-19 positive employees. Each station and its equipment were decontaminated and those who were potentially affected were quarantined, Ford said. Usually three employees share a bunk room during shifts. The fire department said it has issued over 50 informational bulletins and written orders and several videos related to coronavirus. The department is requiring its members to wear personal protective equipment, and masks must be worn throughout the entirety of shifts. All employees have their temperatures taken before every shift. Ford said the department has “sufficient” supplies. Maryland officials say at least 13,684 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus and 582 have died from it.

Watch out for coronavirus scams, Maryland attorney general warns
.W
Maryland’s attorney general is warning residents and investors to be on the lookout for scams related to the new coronavirus. Scammers are setting up websites to sell bogus health products that claim to prevent or cure COVID-19 and using fake emails, texts and social media posts about the illness to steal money and personal information, Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said. “Scammers are taking advantage of people’s fear of getting sick from COVID-19," Frosh said in an announcement. “Consumers can avoid being cheated by understanding how these thieves are trying to steal their personal information and money.” Maryland health officials have confirmed the state’s first three cases of the virus, the respiratory disease that has sickened at least 100,000 across the globe and killed more than 3,000. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday night that the state’s Public Health Laboratory in East Baltimore confirmed the cases, which are all in Montgomery County. Two are a married couple in their 70s and the third is an unrelated woman in her 50s who had traveled with them. They are all recovering in isolation in their homes. Frosh said Friday that swindlers are posing as authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization. Scammers send emails claiming to offer updated information about how people can protect themselves from COVID-19, the attorney general said. He warned that such unsolicited emails from those agencies or from other “experts,” who say they have information about the virus are likely “phishing” attempts to get money or personal information. Or they could be trying to download viruses or malware onto computers. Likewise, anyone seeking donations to help victims or for research, especially in cash, prepaid credit cards or gift cards, is likely a scammer. No vaccines, drugs or treatment products have been approved yet for the coronavirus and pitches for such products or cures are likely fraudulent — and the products themselves could be harmful. The attorney general’s office advised against clicking on suspicious links in emails or online and to seek information from reliable sources such as the CDC or the Maryland Department of Health. Complaints against fraudulent health claims can be filed with the Federal Trade Commission or reported to the state’s Consumer Protection Division by calling 410-528-8662. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is warning about online promotions, including on social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly traded companies can prevent, detect or cure coronavirus and that investment in such stocks will increase in value. The SEC warns that investors could lose “significant” amounts of money if they invest in companies making fraudulent claims. Scams also could involve “pump-and-dump” schemes in which promoters hype a stock, get many people to invest and then sell off their own shares quickly for a profit — before the stocks become worthless.

Here’s what you need to know if you get laid off in Maryland during coronavirus pandemic
.W
A record-shattering surge of more than 334,000 Marylanders are among more than 26 million Americans who have filed for unemployment since mid-March — so many that the claims are overloading the system. State labor officials said the surge in applications for unemployment benefits has created a backlog to access a federal database used to verify Social Security numbers. And it is taxing a website and phone lines used to accept unemployment claims. A new online portal meant to ease widespread frustrations of workers trying to apply for unemployment benefits made a glitchy debut Friday. Maryland’s 400 workers who process unemployment claims typically handle about 2,000 claims per week, but have been working extra hours and on Saturdays to help process the surge in applications, state Labor Secretary Tiffany Robinson said. But the department has recently been receiving tens of thousands of calls a day from people with applications for or questions about unemployment benefits. Dayne Freeman, assistant labor secretary for unemployment insurance, said the state is working to make the unemployment claims process easier for workers affected by mass layoffs, and to help companies keep their unemployment insurance premium costs down. Maryland had about $1.3 billion in the fund from which it pays unemployment benefits as of the beginning of the year, according to federal data. At that level, the state is at risk of needing to borrow federal money to meet its unemployment benefit obligations, ranking 37th among states on a measure of fund solvency, according to a U.S. Department of Labor report. Whether that becomes necessary will depend on how long coronavirus-related business closures last. Gov. Larry Hogan ordered gyms and movie theaters to close indefinitely, and he has limited restaurants and bars to carryout or delivery only. About 259,000 people work in the state’s restaurant industry alone, about 9% of the state workforce, according to the Restaurant Association of Maryland. And after Hogan ordered all non-essential businesses closed, state labor and commerce officials announced stepped-up plans to assist small-business owners and their employees. That included $175 million in a business relief program to help businesses retain and continue to pay employees, and a loosening of normal rules for recipients of unemployment benefits. Here’s what you need to know if you are among those out of work. Who can file for unemployment? The system is for people who have lost jobs through no fault of their own, including both part-time and full-time workers. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, that includes those laid off because of losses of business or production tied to the outbreak. Some people who have been ordered by a doctor or public health official to isolate themselves may also be eligible for unemployment benefits, according to the state labor department. Legislation the General Assembly approved last week makes people eligible for benefits if they have to leave their jobs to avoid risk of coronavirus exposure or to care for an infected family member. Hogan signed the measure into law last month, and it took effect immediately. People can also file for unemployment if their workplace is closed because of social distancing orders, even if they haven’t been formally laid off from their jobs. And the federal COVID-19 stimulus legislation, the CARES Act, also offers unemployment to a sector of the economy not traditionally eligible for the benefits — the self-employed, including so-called “gig” economy workers. Maryland’s system is not yet set up to process those claims, though, and it’s unclear when it will be ready, Robinson said Friday. Labor officials are asking people who will become eligible for unemployment benefits under that policy to enter their e-mail addresses on its website so they can be alerted when the state can start taking their claims. How do you claim unemployment benefits? Unemployment claims can be submitted online through the state Labor Department website, or by phone from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. weekdays. Claimants are asked to provide basic information, including name, Social Security number, address and telephone number; and employment information, including employer contact information and the reason for leaving each job held within the past 18 months. Maryland also added a new online portal for jobless claims on April 24. Anyone who works for the federal government or who has worked outside of Maryland for any part of the past 18 months must file for unemployment by phone, though Ricci said labor officials are looking to allow more people the ability to file online. Ricci said Thursday all residents who have successfully filed initial unemployment claims, whether by phone or online, can now use the online system to seek benefits for past weeks. For faster service, state labor officials are encouraging people to stagger when they call or go online to request assistance, with last names A through F filing on Mondays, last names G through N filing on Tuesdays and last names O through Z filing on Wednesdays and all names on Thursday and Friday. Marylanders will be helped whenever they file, but officials hope the voluntary system could help spread out the unprecedented surge of claims. Freeman said the state is working with employers who are making mass layoffs to smooth the unemployment claims process for those workers, collecting lists of names directly from the employers. To continue receiving the benefits, recipients must report any income and, typically, they must also document that they are regularly searching for new work. But Robinson said the state is waiving the work search requirement during the coronavirus pandemic. How much money can you receive? For most recipients, unemployment benefits are calculated using their earnings over the first four of the last five calendar quarters — so, for anyone who first became eligible for benefits in March, benefits are based on income earned in the year that ended Sept. 30. For those filing initial claims this month or in May or June, benefits will be based on calendar year 2019 earnings. People generally receive about half of gross weekly wages, up to a maximum of $430 a week. Anyone eligible for unemployment insurance in Maryland can receive at least $50 a week. Normally, benefits can be paid out for as long as 26 weeks. But the federal government is increasing those payouts as part of an economic relief bill in Congress. A significant expansion of unemployment benefits for the millions who will lose jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak was included in what is known as the CARES Act. That includes a provision to offer an extra $600 a week on top of the unemployment aid that states provide, making Marylanders eligible for up to $1,030 a week through the end of July. Another allows people to collect benefits for 13 extra weeks, But that money has not yet reached jobless residents. Robinson said Friday that it will begin going out with unemployment benefits for the week that started April 4. The labor department is still working to reprogram its system to begin offering the extra 13 weeks of benefits, Robinson said. What do unemployment claims mean for employers? Companies pay unemployment insurance taxes for each employee, and the amount depends on how often they have laid off workers over the past three years. For most employers, it’s $25.50 per employee, but rates can go as high as $637.50 if companies lay large numbers of people off. Any unemployment claims tied to layoffs can increase those taxes by adding to what is known as an employer’s experience rating. The more a company’s former employees seek unemployment benefits, the higher that employer’s experience rating; the higher the experience rating, the more the company pays in unemployment taxes. Unemployment tax rates are set at the beginning of each calendar year, based on the amount of money the state has in its unemployment insurance trust fund on Sept. 30 of the prior year. So employers would not see any changes in tax rates until 2021. State labor officials are in discussions with their federal counterparts about how to potentially limit the impact of coronavirus-related layoffs on future tax rates. That could include granting employers waivers for any increases to their experience ratings tied to layoffs that occur during temporary coronavirus-related business shutdowns.

Maryland prison system reports 17 confirmed coronavirus cases; attorneys seek relief for juveniles held in confinement 
.W
The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services announced Friday that 17 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed inside correctional facilities statewide, and the state Office of the Public Deender followed with a petition to help get children out of juvenile detention facilities. The events mark the latest battle line as Maryland officials deal with the growing assault on state institutions. As of Thursday evening, three inmates, eight contractual staff, four correctional officers and two Division of Probation employees have all tested positive for COVID-19, according to a media release from the Office of Communications and Outreach. The confirmed cases are in the Jessup, Baltimore and Hegerstown regions. The most cases have been reported in the Jessup Correctional Institution, with eight, including two inmates and six contractual employees. The Baltimore Metropolitan Center has two positive COVID-19 cases, including a correctional officer and one contractual employee, according to the department. Also Friday, the Maryland Office of the Public Defender filed an application with the state’s highest court for extraordinary relief for children in Maryland’s Juvenile jails and prisons. The office asked the Maryland Court of Appeals to act quickly, asserting “it is not a question of if, but when COVID-19 will arrive in Maryland juvenile jails.” There are an estimated 347 youth held in juvenile jail facilities, including children as young as 11-years-old. Earlier this month, health professionals called for the release of young offenders to “mitigate harm” from a COVID-19 outbreak. “In crowded, congregate facilities it is impossible for young people to maintain the recommended distance or take the necessary steps to sanitize the surfaces they encounter,” according to the public defender’s petition to the court. "Release is the only effective means of protecting young people from contracting and transmitting COVID-19. In fact, confining a large number of people to an enclosed area – like the Princess cruise ship or Life Care nursing home outbreaks demonstrate – creates the ideal breeding ground for the pandemic.” The adult jail facilities are already starting to show the strain. Friday’s announcement that 17 people connected to the prison system noted that a jail in Baltimore had one contractual employee test positive for the virus. Dorsey Run Correctional Facility, another facility in Jessup, confirmed one positive case for a correctional officer, as has the Maryland Correctional Institution in Jessup. One correctional officer in Hagerstown tested positive for the virus at the Maryland Correctional Training Center. One inmate at the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women tested positive. A supervisor at the Division of Parole and Probation in Hagerstown and an agent at the Division of Parole and Probation in Baltimore also tested positive, according to the department. After a person tests positive, the department’s COVID-19 response team begins “contact tracing” to locate any staff member, inmate, detainee, or supervised individual who may have had contact, the department has said. Inmates who test positive are monitored in isolation for a minimum of 14 days and will have to be medically cleared to return for work. This story will be updated.

PEEPshow, Carroll County’s biggest visitor attraction now postponed by coronavirus, to get ‘prequel’ online
.W
The Carroll County Arts Council’s PEEPShow, which annually draws in tens of thousands of people, had to be postponed this year in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In the meantime, organizers have announced an online preview. “PEEPshow the Prequel,” which is planned to run from April 17 to May 1, will both allow sculptors to show off their creations and the public to vote for their favorites. Registration is open now for creators at CarrollCountyArtsCouncil.org. Creators can enter still images or videos. The Arts Council still hopes to reschedule the 2020 PEEPShow in person if it is possible. “Should circumstances prevent the Arts Council from rescheduling, the photos will remain online for everyone to view and enjoy. PEEPshow the Prequel will ensure that no matter the outcome, the public will get to see all the hard work this year’s decorators have put into their PEEP-tastic entries while also supporting the Arts Council through this trying time,” the Arts Council wrote in a news release. CCAC Executive Director Judy Morley said in the release that she hopes PEEPshow the Prequel “will give the community a joyful activity to do at home, especially if we are ultimately not able to reschedule.” Viewers will be able to view the online show for free and buy votes for their Audience Favorites. All proceeds from votes will benefit the Arts Council, a nonprofit that was forced to cancel or postpone the live spring events and gallery shows. Sponsors for the PEEPShow include Just Born/Peeps & Company, New Windsor State Bank, the Carroll County Office of Tourism, Quantum Internet and Telephone, and Ben Rogers of Edward Jones Investments.

Stop blaming Trump for spread of the coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
It’s unpleasant to be trapped behind four walls, hiding from the coronavirus. It’s even more unpleasant to hear politicians and reporters finger pointing and salivating at another opportunity to discredit our president. People are dying, losing their jobs and are stranded in their homes. It is time for unity and support, not for finding fault. But if you must play the blame game, make sure you have all the pieces. President Donald Trump has not been the cause of any delay or slow response. He was one of the first world leaders to limit travel from China and eventually Europe. At the time, he was chastised by the World Health Organization for overreacting, criticized by European leaders (who later shut down their own borders), and demonized by Joe Biden, who said Mr. Trump had “a record of hysteria, xenophobia and fear-mongering.” Mr. Trump fully committed the Centers for Disease Control and every other federal health agency to our defense. This includes around 80,000 doctors, microbiologists and other personnel experienced in dealing with medical crisis. He deployed the National Guard to build hospitals and distribute food and supplies. He sent hospital ships to New York and Los Angeles. He obtained the cooperation of private corporations to transform their operations into the manufacturing of masks, respirators and other supplies to meet the extraordinary demand. President Donald Trump also signed a $2.2 trillion funding package to mitigate the impact of an economic shutdown on employees and employers. He has worked closely with governors, respecting their authority to address the needs of their own states while providing backup resources. He has given the nation daily updates, praised the medical community and expressed that “not even one death is acceptable.” He has occasionally been overly optimistic or given us false hope, but only to dampen the level of panic. Nevertheless, if you must blame someone, then start with the following list. Blame the Chinese government, which concealed the outbreak and delayed the release of key information. The World Health Organization that announced on Jan. 14th that the virus was not transferable between humans, only to back-peddle on Jan. 30th and declare a global health emergency. The Democratic Party, which distracted the government through the early days of the crisis with counter-productive impeachment proceedings. Then there’s the Department of Health and Human Services which failed to replenish the national stockpile of certain medical equipment, such as masks, which had been depleted during the Obama administration. The Centers for Disease Control whose original test kit failed to provide reliable readings and had to be re-engineered, delaying its implementation. Blame past administrations who allowed a large majority of our pharmaceutical drug and hospital mask production to be outsourced to China. Blame the idiots who failed to heed warnings about social distancing, such as the college students reveling on beaches during spring break. Blame the politicians and media who continue to sow discord and assault our leadership in the middle of a national crisis. But here’s an even better idea. Don’t blame anyone, and just accept reality. Accept that it takes time to go to war whether you are responding to an attack on Pearl Harbor or the invasion of a microscopic enemy. Accept that it takes time for scientists to develop tests, treatments and vaccines. That it takes time to study a unique medical threat and decipher how to survive it. And that it is difficult to prepare for the unknown. Accept that it takes time to ramp up production, retool industries, train employees and distribute product across the country. It’s hard enough to keep up with a sudden surge in demand for toilet paper, much less masks, respirators and sophisticated test kits. Accept the flaws of bureaucracy. Understand that big governments are inherently slow and inefficient. A deadly virus can spread halfway across the world in the same time it takes to get your license renewed at the Department of Motor Vehicles Administration. Yet, ironically, the people who are now complaining about the government’s slower-than-desired response are the same ones who want our entire health care system operated by the government. Since the WHO declared the coronavirus to be an international public health emergency in late January, our country has taken historic steps in our fight against it. Until we prevail, let’s put our political bias aside and get behind the president of the United States and his administration who are waging an aggressive battle to protect us. Stay safe inside with your family, get out the Monopoly board and put away the blame game. It’s never fun and this is not the time to play it.

Forget about it: The Hogans crush Trump on both tests and trust when it comes to coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
So, my fellow Marylanders, who are you going to believe: Trump or Hogan? President Donald Trump claims that Gov. Larry Hogan “didn’t understand” that he could have easily obtained all the coronavirus testing Maryland needed, right here at home, without making a deal with South Korea. Who are you going to believe, the president who claimed falsely that “anyone who wants a test can get a test” or a governor who sized things up and decided Maryland had to take action of its own to test for the virus? Who are you going to trust on this, a president who has made 18,000 false or misleading claims since he took office (according to The Washington Post fact-checker) or a governor who speaks firmly and without bluster about his state’s response to the deadly virus? And who are you going to take seriously, a president who pretty much told governors they were on their own to deal with the virus or a governor who took decisive action, without waiting for signals from the White House, to protect as many of his citizens as possible? “The administration made it clear over and over again they want the states to take the lead and we have to go out and do it ourselves,” Hogan says. “So, that’s exactly what we did.” There’s no contest here, of course. A president who has lied as much as Trump has — and who continues to fill the air with bluster to try to cover his administration’s missteps in preparing for a national emergency — has no credibility. It is one of the worst scenarios you could imagine: a president millions of Americans don’t trust at a time when the country faces the worst public health crisis in a century. It’s no wonder that Marylanders turn to local and state leaders, starting with their governor, for honest leadership. On Sunday, Hogan — still a Republican, last time we checked — came as close as he’s ever come to calling the president a liar, telling CNN that it was “absolutely false” for Trump to suggest governors weren’t doing everything they can to test for the virus more widely. “It’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there and the governors should just get it done,” said Hogan. And, of course, Trump has been pushing to “reopen the economy” without having millions of tests readily available. That approaches an unprecedented level of presidential irresponsibility. We might be starting to catch up, but a nation of 328 million people has conducted just 4 million tests so far, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Hogan knows — because he apparently listens to health experts — that a key to gradually reopening society is testing to see who has the virus and who doesn’t. Anyone with common sense understands that. So it was remarkable Monday afternoon to hear Hogan announce that Maryland would directly purchase kits good for 500,000 tests from a company in South Korea, a country that set the standard for early testing. Hogan’s wife, first lady Yumi Hogan, was born in South Korea. She got involved in closing the deal for the tests, and that’s great, but it also points to the nation’s lack of preparedness for a crisis that public health officials had modeled and predicted months ago. Test kits, ventilators, face masks — much of the supply chain for those important products has moved outside of the traditional path from the federal government down to the states. When the president does not establish a national strategy for a national emergency, when he does not readily use his authority to rev up production and centralize supplies, you get the kind of chaos and stress we saw early on: States in bidding wars for ventilators, a national stockpile of protective equipment being quickly depleted and not sufficient for the states’ needs. So no wonder Larry and Yumi Hogan used their relationship with South Korea to get tests for Maryland. Good for them, good for us. Under dire circumstances, the Hogans did what they believed had to be done. There’s a lot of that going on at the local level: Small businesses making hand sanitizer, volunteers sewing face masks or acquiring them any way they can. Just the other day, the state’s largest public employee union received 20,000 surgical masks from an opera company. After the Maryland Lyric Opera, based in Montgomery County, canceled its upcoming performances, its founder and artistic director, Brad Clark, had his associates find and purchase surgical masks to donate to men and women on the front lines of the pandemic. The masks went to hospitals and nursing facilities and to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in Maryland. Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Maryland, picked up 20,000 of them last week. Moran, who has been sharply critical of the Hogan administration for not doing enough to protect state workers, said the masks will go to staff in state hospitals and youth facilities as well as to commercial vehicle inspectors, workers at truck weigh stations and maintenance workers in state buildings. But, despite AFSCME’s pleadings, these masks are not the best for workers, including nurses and direct-care aides, who have contact with the public, Moran says. Front-line state employees, he says, deserve a more aggressive approach to acquiring top-quality masks from anywhere on the planet. Sounds like another assignment for Yumi Hogan.

More coronavirus cases reported in long-term care facilities, as Carroll County shares less data
.W
The number of cases of the coronavirus among long-term care facilities rose again Tuesday, Carroll County announced, though the county has also decreased the amount of data it is sharing. The county now has 339 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 211 of those have been at long-term care facilities, according to Carroll County Health Department data. Of the 38 deaths Carroll has seen thus far, 34 have been in such facilities. No new deaths were announced Tuesday. Of those 34 people who have died of the disease, 26 were residents at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, three lived at Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster and five were at other long-term care facilities. The Health Department is no longer confirming whether specific long-term care facilities have seen cases among residents. It previously had announced figures for Pleasant View and Carroll Lutheran Village but stopped April 21. “Data specific to the county’s first two outbreaks was released due to the scope of the containment and mitigation responses, which caused details to rapidly become public knowledge,” Maggie Kunz, Health Department spokesperson, said in an email Tuesday. “The county will be following state guidance that protects the confidentiality of outbreak reports in order to protect the privacy of individuals affected. We will continue to share aggregate data for all congregate living facility cases, separate from the total number of community cases.” Maryland health officials have never provided a full list of the nursing homes where outbreaks of the infectious new contagion have been confirmed, even to the administrators and staff working to protect elderly and infirm residents. Some counties have declined to name facilities with COVID-19 cases, saying they needed authorization from the state to share them publicly. Long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities, have been hotspots for COVID-19 cases throughout the state. Those who are elderly or have existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the disease. Asked about state policy on releasing the information, Maryland health department spokesman Charlie Gischlar said local health departments “make their decisions about the information they release based on HIPAA policies, requirements, and state laws.” The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects patients’ access to their health records as well as the privacy of individually identifiable health information. Maryland on Tuesday saw a single-day high in new deaths related to the coronavirus, with officials announcing 68 new confirmed deaths for a new total of 584. They attribute another 68 probable deaths to the virus, likely caused by the infection but not confirmed by a laboratory test. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state rose to at least 14,193, as Maryland announced 509 new positive tests. Carroll County also reported Tuesday that it considers 60 people to be recovered from the disease, up by two people since Monday. Of the 128 people who were confirmed with the virus not at a long-term care facility, 63 are women and 64 are men, with gender information for one more person unknown. Two people are between the ages of 10 and 19; 23 are between ages 20 and 29; 13 are between ages 30 and 39; 20 between ages 40 and 49; 44 between ages 50 and 59; 15 between ages 60 and 69; six between ages 70 and 79; and five between ages 80 and 89. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Baltimore Sun reporters Scott Dance and Nathan Ruiz contributed to this article.

Maryland opens new state portal to connect buyers, sellers of protective gear during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Maryland officials have launched a new online portal where those in need of protective gear such as masks and gloves can find local sellers, aiding the hunt for critical items in short supply at hospitals and elsewhere during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Larry Hogan has identified securing adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, or PPE, as a pillar to his plan to lift distancing measures and reopen the state. The others are hospital capacity as well as adequate testing and contact tracing for those possibly infected with the COVID-19 illness. “One of the biggest challenges Maryland and our nation have faced in battling coronavirus has been ensuring we have a steady supply of PPE for our health care workers, first responders, and essential employees,” said Hogan said in a statement. “This portal offers a one-stop-shop where manufacturers of PPE and other essential items can connect with the buyers that need these items the most and help us address critical supply chain demand.” Hospitals and other facilities have their own supply chains, but they have been stretched to the limit by the pandemic. There are numerous reports of nurses wearing then cleaning single-use masks repeatedly and doctors avoiding going bedside to preserve gear. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even issued guidance on how to preserve and reuse protective gear. The Maryland Manufacturing Network Supplier Portal is operated by the Maryland Department of Commerce and the Maryland Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The sales won’t happen on the website, but the buyers and sellers can find each other and make a deal offline, officials said. The sellers are Maryland firms, including manufacturers that have received government grants to increase or pivot production to protective gear. Separately, the state has been buying and distributing protective equipment. Since March 27, officials report that a state task force has secured: 4.5 million KN95 masks, 3.5 million gloves, 1.1 million face shields, 600,000 N95 masks, 150,000 gowns, 47,000 gallons of hand sanitizer and 5,000 infared thermometers. It’s not clear how much has been distributed and used, or how much remains in state warehouses. Hopsitals are tracking the gear to make sure it goes where it’s most needed, but they go through supplies quickly dealing with the contagious respiratory illness. LifeBridge Health operates several hospitals and reports, for example, that it averages 4,500 N95 masks per week, 575,000 gloves per week and 45,000 isolation gowns per week. The portal can help fill more gaps, state officials said. “We believe this will provide a key resource to connect buyers that are in need of critical items with the Maryland manufacturers that are capable of producing them,” said Michael Kelleher, executive director of the state’s manufacturing extension partnership, in a statement.

Lawsuit filed in Maryland says US citizens with immigrant spouses should get coronavirus relief payments
.W
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has sued the federal government over its denial of coronavirus relief payments to U.S. citizens who are married to immigrants without Social Security numbers. The lawsuit was filed in Maryland on Tuesday on behalf of six American citizens who were denied coronavirus relief checks because they filed and paid taxes with a spouse who has what’s known as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or a way for immigrants without legal status to still pay federal taxes, which millions do. MALDEF says the Treasury Department is violating Americans' First and Fifth Amendments by denying them payment simply because of who they are married to. Congress last month passed a $2.2 trillion package to help businesses, workers and a health care system staggered by the coronavirus. Many Americans had their share deposited into their accounts in the last couple of weeks. It’s estimated that 2 million U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are married to people without social security numbers, although it’s unclear how many of them file jointly with them. “All of the families are very much like other families in the U.S. They have children at home, they are facing contraction of the economy and they still have to pay their rent, and buy groceries and buy gas,” said Nina Perales, MALDEF’s vice president of litigation. Christina Segundo-Hernandez, who lives in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the plaintiffs in the case. Segundo-Hernandez is a U.S. citizen married to a Mexican immigrant who pays federal taxes through his ITIN. The couple, married eight years, file jointly each year. They’re both working fewer hours because of the coronavirus pandemic, and they’ve fallen behind on bills. Getting a coronavirus relief check would have helped. “I would have been able to fill up my refrigerator for my kids,” said Segundo-Hernandez, who has four children. “I think it needs to be known that there’s people out there that are doctors and things like that that are putting their lives at risk going through the same thing. They’re being betrayed by their government because of who they’re married to.” David Hessell-Cercado, a fourth grade teacher in Los Angeles, is an American citizen married to a Mexican immigrant who is close to getting his permanent resident status. Hessell-Cercado isn’t involved in the lawsuit, but will also not benefit from the coronavirus relief payments that went out to millions of Americans recently. Hessell-Cercado said he feels lucky to still work, but thinks it's unfair that Americans are being left out of the coronavirus relief package because of who they married. “What hurt more was just the sheer meanness of it,” he said. “Anyone who marries someone and goes through an immigration process already has to deal with years and years and years of just delays and obstacles and hurdles to get over. It just seems like something else that they put out there just to sort of be mean to us.”

170 coronavirus cases confirmed at FutureCare Lochearn in Baltimore in state’s largest nursing home outbreak
.W
In one of the largest known coronavirus outbreaks in the country, 129 residents and 41 staffers at a Northwest Baltimore nursing home have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, officials with the city and the home’s operator confirmed Wednesday. The FutureCare Lochearn facility reported its first confirmed case March 31, Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said, and as of Tuesday morning, 35 infections had been reported there, state officials said. FutureCare officials said they had been following guidance to restrict visitors and require staff to wear protective equipment. FutureCare discovered that the outbreak had exploded through Lochearn when it decided to conduct what’s known as “widespread surveillance testing" of both symptomatic and asymptomatic residents and staff. A FutureCare spokeswoman said the company sought out the testing out of concern that the facility’s population of 200 residents was especially vulnerable because it is in an area with some of the highest numbers of COVID-19 infections in the state. Most of the residents were not showing symptoms linked to coronavirus infection, and still are not, FutureCare spokeswoman Holly O’Shea said in a statement. But nursing home administrators “felt strongly that it was important to know who was carrying the virus, even if they didn’t present specific COVID-19 symptoms, to mitigate its spread and protect our staff and residents,” she said. In most nursing homes and other health care settings, asymptomatic people are not being tested for the coronavirus because of a scarcity of testing materials and backups in labs. “This type of surveillance testing is unprecedented and can save lives,” O’Shea added. It was not immediately clear when the facility conducted the widespread testing. O’Shea did not respond to questions about the timeline of the outbreak. With 170 total cases at FutureCare Lochearn, the cluster appears to be the second-largest in the country tied to nursing homes, behind only the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where 194 people have contracted the coronavirus, according to data collected by The New York Times. It is the eighth-largest known coronavirus cluster in the country, behind only outbreaks on an aircraft carrier, in jails and prisons, and at a South Dakota pork processing plant, according to the data. It surpasses the total at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Carroll County, where 82 residents and 39 staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. Twenty-four Pleasant View residents have died. In a statement provided by FutureCare, Dr. Morgan Jane Katz, an infectious disease specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine and assistant professor in the Hopkins medical school, said the company is “one of the only facilities” in Maryland that proactively pursued universal testing of residents and staff, and therefore the spread of the virus at Lochearn appears more extreme than elsewhere. "We likely do not have a sense of how widespread this infection is in many nursing homes because most are not testing asymptomatic residents,” Katz said. “If facilities do not test, their numbers will be lower. This does not mean that the COVID-19 is not there.” COVID-19 infections have now been reported in nearly two-thirds of Maryland nursing homes — 145 of 226 facilities, according to state officials. The Times reported Tuesday that coronavirus infections have been reported in 2,500 nursing homes and long-term care facilities across the country, with 21,000 people infected and 3,800 killed. That includes another FutureCare facility in Baltimore, its Cold Spring center in Lauraville, where at least five people tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. That included both residents and staff, and at least two people were hospitalized. City health officials are assisting FutureCare, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said. And state officials said FutureCare notified them of the outbreak Tuesday night, and Wednesday morning requested a nursing home “strike team" to help manage the situation. The state sent a team to the facility that includes members of the National Guard, emergency medicine clinicians, and doctors and nurses from local hospitals, officials said. O’Shea said FutureCare is working with partners at LifeBridge Health and Johns Hopkins Medicine, and that the company’s “highest priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our staff and residents.” Under state and federal guidelines, patients who have tested positive for coronavirus are to be segregated from those who test negative. Many residents of the facility share rooms. According to state data, it has 40 private rooms, 74 semi-private rooms with two beds and four rooms with three beds. O’Shea said no rooms have more than two residents. Health workers are required to follow strict protocols when caring for infected patients, including wearing gowns, masks and face shields. Under an order Gov. Larry Hogan issued last week, all care providers must wear masks at all times in nursing homes. That order aimed to prevent the spread of the virus through staff members who aren’t showing any symptoms of COVID-19 illness, as happened in the outbreak at Pleasant View in Carroll County. Dzirasa said the outbreak offers a reminder of the dangers of asymptomatic transmission. “It is safe to assume when we go places, we may come in contact with people not showing symptoms,” she said. The nursing home is in the 21215 ZIP code, which for days has reported the highest number of cases of any ZIP code in Maryland. It serves patients on hemodialysis and provides both short-term rehabilitation and long-term care, according to its website. It has received “average” ratings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for health inspections and evaluations of staffing, and a five-star, “much above average” rating for quality of care. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former city and state health commissioner now on the faculty at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the FutureCare outbreak demonstrates “the scale of the challenge” of protecting nursing home residents while work to study how the virus is spreading in those facilities remains ongoing. “I think there will be a lot learned from this outbreak that could help with understanding the risks we may not have fully appreciated,” he said. Baltimore Sun reporters Talia Richman and Luke Broadwater contributed to this article.

Maryland confirms 1,200 new coronavirus cases as state approaches 30,000 infections
.W
Maryland officials said Thursday the state confirmed 1,211 new cases of the coronavirus, the state’s second largest single-day increase in infections. The state also reported 63 new deaths from COVID-19, the disease associated with the virus, bringing Maryland’s death toll to 1,401, not counting an additional 102 deaths believed to be caused by the virus, but not confirmed by a laboratory test. Maryland’s 14-day rolling average of new confirmed fatalities has not dropped from one day to the next since the start of April. The new infections confirmed Thursday bring the state to at least 29,374 coronavirus cases. Including Thursday, six of the state’s nine highest single-day increases in new cases have come in the past week, which state officials attribute partly to expanded testing. Thursday’s 4,588 reported test results are the highest total of the past four days. The implementation of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s three-phase reopening plan is dependent on the decline or flattening of the number of cases that require hospitalization and intensive care. “We’re making sure we don’t overload our hospitals, but we also can’t continue to have people unemployed,” Hogan said in a Thursday interview with the website Barstool Sports. “We’ve got to strike that balance.” The number of patients currently hospitalized dropped from 1,707 to 1,683. The state hasn’t reported fewer than 1,600 current hospitalizations since April 28, with the peak being 1,711 on April 30. During that same span, Maryland has reported between 550 and 590 cases in intensive care each day. As of Thursday morning, the state has 584 ICU cases, matching Wednesday’s number. There have been 2,029 patients who have been released from isolation since being confirmed to have the virus. The one-day increase of 126 recoveries — up almost 7% since Wednesday — marks the state’s largest single-day jump since April 19. Although the stay-at-home order remains in place, the state made progress toward reopening Wednesday when Hogan announced that restrictions outdoor recreational activities such as golf, tennis and boating would be lifted Thursday. Wednesday also brought the formal closing of Maryland schools for the rest of the school year, nearly two months since students and teachers were first thrust into distance learning. “Smart folks, like the president’s coronavirus task force, people like Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and Dr. [Deborah] Birx, they’re telling us that this thing can spike right back up again,” Hogan said. “We’re not flipping a switch. We’re dialing things up, trying to get things back to normal in a safe and effective way.” Certain areas in the state have been hit harder by the virus than others. Half of the top 10 ZIP codes by total cases are in Prince George’s County — which has the state’s most confirmed cases at 8,516. Montgomery County, which has 6,032 confirmed cases, includes three of the top five ZIP codes by total cases. Two Baltimore-area ZIP codes, 21215 and 21224, rank eighth and ninth, respectively. The state reported Wednesday that nearly 60% of the virus’ victims in Maryland were residents of long-term care facilities such as nursing homes. Of the state’s confirmed 2,317 infected residents at least 80 years old, more than a quarter have died. Those 611 fatalities account for nearly half of Maryland’s death toll from COVID-19, while nearly 90% of those the virus and its effects have killed in the state were at least 60 years old. Among the infected and dead for whom race data was available, those who are black account for more than 40% of both groups, though African Americans are only 30% of Maryland’s overall population. Maryland’s Hispanic population, about 10% of its residents, make up about nearly a quarter of the state’s confirmed cases.

Maryland reports 989 newly confirmed coronavirus cases and 26 deaths related to COVID-19
.W
Maryland officials reported Sunday that the state has confirmed 989 new cases of the coronavirus. The state has recorded 25,642 total cases of COVID-19. Twenty-six more people died due to complications from the illness since Saturday, bringing the state total up to 1,182 fatalities. In addition, 99 people have probably died due to the disease or complications of it, but state officials are awaiting laboratory results to confirm their diagnosis. As of Sunday, 1,635 people are hospitalized with the disease, which is 22 fewer than Saturday. It marks the second straight day of declining figures for hospitalizations, which state officials have said are a key factor in determining when to relax social distancing guidelines, travel restrictions and allow businesses across the state to reopen. However, while there have been two straight days of declining hospitalizations and Sunday’s figures represent a decline in the number of daily new cases compared to Saturday, the state has yet to come close to 14 straight days of decreasing newly confirmed cases. Gov. Larry Hogan said that the state would need to see two consecutive weeks of declines in the number of new cases before the state would begin its reopening process, although he said he’d be flexible in his interpretation of that guideline from President Donald Trump. In total, 5,051 people in Maryland have been hospitalized due to complications from COVID-19, with 1,666 since released from isolation, the state reported. Prince George’s and Montgomery counties continue to lead the state in total cases, with 7,333 and 5,150, respectively. The D.C. suburbs continue to lead the state in newly confirmed cases, as more than half of Sunday’s newly confirmed cases, 523, came from Montgomery and Prince George’s counties alone. The 20783 ZIP code — which includes parts of Hyattsville, Adelphi and Langley Park in Prince George’s County — continues to lead the state in total cases with 817, adding 44 new cases in the past 24 hours. The county closed its coronavirus testing site at FedEx Field Wednesday and will reopen it at the county health department’s Cheverly clinic Monday. In a release, County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said the new site would allow the county “to expand our testing capacity ... without concern for weather conditions.” Silver Spring in Montgomery County continues to see a high concentration of cases as three zip codes associated with the D.C. suburb — 20906, 20902 and 20904 — have a combined 1,407 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Two zip codes in the Baltimore region, 21215 and 21228, also continue to see high counts of the disease, with 398 cases and 324 cases, respectively. The high number of cases in 21215, which includes parts of Northwest Baltimore and Baltimore county, is partly due to an outbreak at the FutureCare Lochearn nursing home, where 154 residents and 66 staff members have been confirmed to have contracted the disease. At least 14 people have died at the facility, according to state officials.

The Real Housewives of Potomac premiere pushed back because of the coronavirus
.W
The coronavirus has struck again. This time, COVID-19 has caused a hiccup with the popular Bravo reality show The Real Housewives of Potomac, which was scheduled to premiere Sunday. “Bravo has pushed back our premiere date until sometime in the summer,” cast member Robyn Dixon confirmed. “We’re very disappointed about it. But it is for a good reason.” Filming wrapped in December for its fifth season. “It’s not because we don’t have the content,” she said. “It’s because Bravo doesn’t have any other shows filming," as a safety measure to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Dixon explained that Bravo pushed back the Potomac franchise so that they would have at least one new franchise show come Fall. Once the season airs, Dixon promises plenty of entertainment and a few surprises. Dixon said that she will continue to reconcile her relationship with her ex-husband, former Maryland Terps basketball star and Coppin State coach Juan Dixon. “There is a lot of drama in it and there is a lot of great stuff that happened throughout the season,” Dixon said. “We’re just excited about the season and we appreciate the support.” The show also stars Gizelle Bryant, the ex-wife of former Baltimore pastor Jamal Bryant and arguably the face of the show. Gizelle also recently rekindled her relationship with Jamal. The women of Potomac will welcome a new cast member, Wendy Osefo, an assistant professor in the Doctor of Education program at the Johns Hopkins School of Education. She’s also a political analyst, and entrepreneur.

Five residents, eight staff members test positive for coronavirus at Parkville’s Oak Crest Senior Living Community
.W
Thirteen people have tested positive for coronavirus at Parkville’s Oak Crest Senior Living Community, company officials confirmed this week. Five of the retirement community’s 2,100 residents and eight of its 1,300 employees have tested positive since Erickson Living, the Catonsville-based company that manages the community, announced its first positive case of coronavirus in late March, according to Erickson Living spokesman Dan Dunne. Residents who have tested positive are isolated to their apartments and “receiving appropriate care and treatment,” Dunne wrote in an emailed response. Those known to have been in contact with residents or employees who have contracted the COVID-19 infection have been notified and asked to self-quarantine and self-monitor for 14 days, Dunne said. Residents at Oak Crest have access to telemedicine appointments with physicians at the community’s on-site medical center if they develop symptoms, Dunne added. The 21234 ZIP code in which Oak Crest is located has the second-highest concentration of coronavirus casesin Baltimore County, with 162 positive tests as of Tuesday, April 21, according to data from the Maryland Department of Health. Dunne said staff members providing face-to-face care to residents are wearing personal protective gear, including surgical masks, eye protection, gloves and gowns; all employees have been provided face masks, he said. Staff members who reported experiencing symptoms were asked to stay home and call their primary care physician and Oak Crest’s Employee Health and Wellness Center, Dunne said. Prior to the confirmed cases, Oak Crest had prohibited nonessential visitors and closed all dining rooms, and has established a “concierge program" to deliver coffee, tea, snacks and toiletries to residents to encourage social distancing, Dunne said. He added that since the stay-at-home order issued by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, residents are remaining in their apartments. “We continue to do everything in our power to prevent the spread of the virus anywhere on campus by carefully reviewing all CDC guidelines and implementing measures that meet or exceed their recommendations,” Dunne wrote in an email.

Harford County suspends in-person payments amid coronavirus worries
.W
Harford County government will disallow in-person payments at the county administration building in Bel Air from Wednesday onward, the county announced Monday. The payment window at the county’s 220 Main St. office will be closed, but online, mailed, telephone and dropped-off payments will still be accepted, a news release states. Cindy Mumby, the county’s director of governmental and community relations, said the caution comes from the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected two county residents and more than 30 Marylanders to date, prompting Gov. Larry Hogan to take drastic action in temporarily ordering bars, restaurants, gyms, casinos and numerous other businesses to close. Hogan also forbid gatherings of more than 50 people, including those for purposes of religion or entertainment. Later Monday, the White House advised people not gather in groups of more than 10. Mumby said county government was adhering closely to the governor’s recommendations and orders. “We are following the directives from the Governor’s office on these matters,” she said. Electronic credit card payments on tax and assessment payments incur a 2.25% fee, but electronic checks cost nothing extra, Mumby said. The fee is imposed by credit card companies, she said, not the county. Water, sewer and other payments do not incur the fee for paying with a credit card. County residents can also use the drop-box on the county office’s Bond Street side. Only checks or money orders will be accepted through the drop-box. No cash will be accepted, the release states. Lien sheet payments will be accepted through the mail or the county’s website, while deed payments can be submitted through the mail or electronically on another website. After Tuesday, documents will not be made available for pickup at the treasury’s office. They will instead be mailed to the submitter or delivered to the courthouse, which is not open to the public.

Maryland reports 906 newly confirmed coronavirus cases as number of tests increase
.W
Maryland officials reported Monday that the state has confirmed 906 new cases of the coronavirus after receiving a record-high 8,311 test results in a 24-hour span. The state has confirmed 19,487 total cases of COVID-19. Thirty-one more people died due to complications from the illness since Sunday, bringing the state total up to 858 fatalities. Another four more deaths were listed as probably caused by the coronavirus, bringing to 87 the number of likely deaths that haven’t been confirmed by a laboratory test. Michael Ricci, spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan, attributed the record number of tests performed to resources the state procured from South Korea earlier this month. The state purchased $9 million worth of supplies needed to administer 500,000 tests. Hogan’s wife, South Korean native Yumi Hogan, helped broker the deal as Hogan and governors across the country complained that the Trump administration and the federal government had not done enough to make testing more available. After averaging around 4,200 newly completed tests from April 22 through April 25, the state announced Sunday that 7,532 test results had been secured since Saturday. Monday built on that increase, with its count of 8,133 tests results, about 600 tests more than the day before. Hogan announced Monday that the state will open two more drive-through COVID-19 testing sites, in Baltimore County and Calvert County, at converted Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program stations this week, bringing the total to seven. The Baltimore County facility is in Owings Mills. With 906 newly confirmed cases, Monday’s total is an 11% increase over Sunday’s number of 815 new cases. It’s the state’s fourth largest single-day increase. The state has yet to see more than two consecutive days in which the number of new cases was lower than the day before. Hogan has said that he would decide about reopening the state’s businesses and lifting restrictions when the state sees a downward trend in new cases and hospitalizations over a 14-day span. As of Monday, 1,513 people are hospitalized with the disease, up 50 from Sunday. The state reported 535 people in intensive care and another 978 people in acute care units being treated for the disease. In total, 4,101 people in Maryland have been hospitalized due to complications from COVID-19, with 1,263 having been since released from isolation, the state reported. The 20783 ZIP code — which includes parts of Hyattsville, Adelphi and Langley Park in Prince George’s County — continues to lead the state in total cases, with 58 new ones in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 505 cases. Silver Spring continues to see a high number of cases as well, as three ZIP codes associated with the Montgomery County town — 20906, 20904 and 20902 — have a combined 998 cases. The 21215 ZIP code — which includes parts of Northwest Baltimore and Baltimore County and the FutureCare Lochearn nursing home, where at least 170 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed — ranks fourth, with 15 new cases in the past 24 hours for a total of 344. Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, Maryland’s two most populated counties, continue to lead the state in total COVID-19 cases, with 5,263 and 3,843, respectively.

Amazon plans to hire additional 3,000 workers in Maryland to meet demand spike during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Amazon said Thursday that it plans to hire an additional 3,000 people in full- and part-time jobs in Maryland because of the spike in demand during the coronavirus pandemic. The planned new hires in the state are part of 75,000 additional jobs across the United States that Amazon announced Thursday to keep up with demand as people heed stay-at-home mandates and shop online. The online retail giant already has hired 3,300 new workers in Maryland during the outbreak. That initial wave of hiring was part of more than 100,000 new full- and part-time Amazon jobs added nationwide in response to the soaring demand. Workers are needed to pick, pack and ship customer orders and groceries, and deliver packages from delivery stations. Employees are being hired for fulfillment centers, sorting centers, delivery stations and Whole Foods Markets stores across the state, with facilities in Baltimore and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Cecil and Montgomery counties and Western Maryland. New Amazon workers in Maryland have joined an existing workforce of more than 7,000 full-time workers statewide. Amazon operates fulfillment centers at Tradepoint Atlantic in eastern Baltimore County, on Broening Highway in Baltimore and in North East as well as a sorting center and a Prime Now hub. Candidates can apply at amazon.com/jobsnow. Jobs are available on a rolling basis and fill up quickly. Applicants are encouraged to sign up for text alerts for regular updates. To accommodate for the coronavirus, Amazon is offering virtual new-hire orientation sessions and providing training and information through online and app-based sessions. Jobs pay a minimum of $17 per hour through the end of April, an increase of $2 an hour during the pandemic. The employer provides masks and other supplies for all employees and drivers and adheres to social distancing in buildings.

7 members of Baltimore County Fire Department are in isolation due to the coronavirus
.W
Seven members of the Baltimore County Fire Department are in isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus, Lt. Travis Francis confirmed Sunday. The first responders who have tested positive for COVID-19 are “seven out of over 1,000” workers, Francis said. The Baltimore County Fire Department announced a confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 27, with a member of the department’s support services testing positive for the respiratory illness. The Baltimore County Health Department conducted contact tracing to see whether anyone had been in close proximity to the infected individual. Asked what safety measures the fire department was undertaking, including whether the Baltimore County Health Department was continuing to conduct contact tracing for the fire department’s latest developments, Francis on Sunday referred to the fire department’s website, which has posted updates to its operations since the spread of the novel coronavirus. The measures include not allowing family members to ride with patients in medic units and ambulances to local hospitals. The Baltimore County Fire Department is also working with the state Department of Health to follow health guidelines for cleaning and sanitizing work areas and equipment. Other steps include the use of appropriate personal protective equipment and daily “healthy check-ins” for all employees to ensure anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 is sent home. Francis said two members were preparing to return to work but did not specify their return date.

Americans aren’t panicking over coronavirus; they are acting responsibly | COMMENTARY
.W
Let’s start with some facts. COVID-19 is killing a lot of people. From the announcement of the first confirmed U.S. case on Jan. 20 to April 16, it has killed nearly 34,000 Americans. (I'll ignore claims that number is inflated as well as more persuasive arguments that it's an undercount.) My longtime friend Bill Bennett, the former secretary of education, recently appeared on Fox News (where we are both contributors) to “put the data in perspective,” as one of the hosts put it. The upshot of Mr. Bennett’s position is that the COVID-19 threat has been wildly exaggerated from the outset. Contrary to every dictionary I can find, he says COVID-19 is not a pandemic, “but we do have panic and pandemonium as a result of the hype of this. And it’s really unfortunate. Look at the facts.” Mr. Bennett’s primary “fact” is that current projections hold that roughly 60,000 Americans will die from COVID-19 (though he thinks it will be less than that). “We’re going to have fewer fatalities from this than from the flu,” he said. “For this, we scared the hell out of the American people” and wrecked the economy. Here’s the first problem: These projections of COVID-19 deaths take into account the social distancing practices we’ve enacted — and they curb the rate of new infections. If we hadn’t started taking precautions, those estimates would be (and were) vastly higher. Thus, Mr. Bennett botches the concept of causality. It’s like yelling at firemen for all the water damage to your house since all that burned up was a tiny part of your kitchen, without acknowledging that if the firefighters hadn’t shown up, the whole house would have burned down. Over the 87 days from the announcement of the first U.S. case to this writing on April 16, COVID-19 has killed, on average, 391 Americans per day. If you annualized that you’d get 142,644 deaths, more than double the estimated 61,000 people who died from the flu during the 2017-2018 flu season that Mr. Bennett cited. But again, that’s misleading, because if left unchecked, the rate of COVID-19 infection would be exponential. The New Atlantis has a helpful chart showing “reported new deaths weekly.” The COVID-19 line starts on Feb. 17, and almost instantly soars past the flu — as well as car crashes and, soon thereafter, cancer. From April 6 to April 12, COVID-19 was the second-biggest cause of death in the U.S., killing 12,392 to heart disease’s 12,626. Those numbers reflect the measures Mr. Bennett impugns as, pardon the term, overkill. To be fair, Mr. Bennett doesn’t propose that we should have done nothing. He suggests we should have just protected the vulnerable population and kept the economy going. I share his concern about the economy, but Sweden has tried something similar, and its death toll is soaring, and its economy is crashing anyway. What bothers me more about Mr. Bennett’s argument isn’t his mischievous epidemiological speculation but his theory for why the country is responding to the pandemic the way it is. He argues on TV and in writing that America has been frightened into an unnecessary overreaction by the media and the left. He wants Americans to man up and respond with the sort of courage we showed after the 9/11 attacks, rather than giving in to the “paranoid style in American politics.” That phrase comes from historian Richard Hofstadter, and Mr. Bennett mangles its meaning. The “paranoid style” in Hofstadter’s telling is the populist tendency to see elites treasonously conspiring against the common good. Mr. Bennett doesn’t ascribe sinister motives to public health “experts” — the scare quotes are his — but his insistence that they aren’t to be trusted lends aid and comfort to the kind of conspiracy-mongering Mr. Hofstadter had in mind. Indeed, Mr. Bennett’s odd refusal to place any blame on Donald Trump for the policies of his administration only fuels the idea that the president is being misled by sinister forces — something one hears constantly from certain quarters of the right. More importantly, the idea that Americans are panicky fraidy-cats strikes me as grossly unfair. Where is the evidence? I see it nowhere in my daily life or in the inspiring stories of courageous health workers and generous citizens. Nor is there much evidence of it in polls, which show overwhelming support for social distancing policies. Mr. Bennett is a famous pro-lifer who sincerely wants to protect the vulnerable unborn. It seems to me the vulnerable born deserve adequate protection too, and the sacrifices Americans are making in that effort aren’t fueled by panic or cowardice, but by heroism.

Carroll County creatives, artisans struggle for path forward amid ‘significant financial impact’ of coronavirus
.W
Even before Maryland’s governor closed non-essential businesses statewide, those in Carroll County who earn a living in creative fields were facing lost income from canceled classes, festivals and live performances. As Marylanders stay home in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus — also known as COVID-19, the disease it causes — before it can overwhelm medical resources, many artists and artisans in Carroll saw sources of income peel away. Nationwide, Americans for the Arts is collecting reports of financial losses and offering resources at www.americansforthearts.org. The full picture of the economic impact of the coronavirus is still unclear, but the Times spoke with a few Carroll artists about the emotional and financial effects, as well as keeping perspective. Shiloh Pottery Married couple Ken and Marty Hankins, who own Shiloh Pottery Studio in Hampstead, have been teaching and making pottery for almost half a century. They have one part-time paid employee who they had to let go. “We’re a very small business ... and we’re wondering if we can survive this,” Marty said. “It’s a big deal for us. We’ve been in business 47 years.” They canceled in-person classes that were supposed to take place in April, but they don’t see moving online as an option. With the weight of pottery items, shipping them costs more than the cost of the item itself, and photographing, listing and packaging items for the internet takes significant time and labor. Their last class was a group of volunteers making bowls for the Empty Bowls fundraiser for The Shepherd’s Staff — an event that ended up being canceled anyway. Even without the moratorium on gatherings of people, Ken was not sure he would want to be around many people; he’s in his 70s and is categorized as medically vulnerable. Another challenge is the uncertainty of not knowing when restrictions will lift and it will be safe to gather again. One option might be to offer those who signed up for spring classes to take summer classes. Or they may have to reschedule their April classes for the fall. “We’re fortunate we don’t depend on the income from the pottery to live on ... but a lot of artists do. We’re retired and have pretty OK retirement income,” Marty said. They try to keep perspective that “literally the entire world is in the same boat.” And if families are trying to pay bills and buy food, pottery falls “pretty far down on the list.” Ashby’s Agates Denise and Brian of Ashby’s Agates are rockhounds, lapidaries and jewelry designers in Westminster. Much of their business involves travel to find and stock stones that they cut and polish themselves. “We do purchase rough material from other lapidaries when we are away, and often come across material that one can only find in the local little rock shops hidden in our western landscapes,” Denise said. Asby’s Agates is a side business for them and they feel fortunate to have full-time jobs, but they hope that travel will be more doable in the summer or fall. The shows where they sell are starting to get canceled throughout 2020. “We started off 2020 with pretty terrific sales at the couple of shows that are now behind us. The funds that we have in the bank now will cover what we have planned for this year. But as for building for 2021, there is the same uncertainty that everyone else is experiencing ... but certainly a minimal concern when other folks are losing their jobs and our society is physically shutting down little by little,” Denise said. “Any economic downturn hurts an artisan’s business. It goes without saying, really, that when people are faced with the hardships with essential life expenses, no one is going to be focused on an art investment. So that’s a little sad and scary for all of us artisans. We love to share our visions and our creations and I believe I speak for all of us when I say that there is great joy when someone connects with what we’re doing. There is an immense sense of pride and gratitude in sharing one’s art pieces.” The creative ways artists are sharing their work, like online craft shows and concerts, are a sign of hope for her. But they prefer to stick to phone calls and a Facebook page, “Ashby’s Agates.” They haven’t had the time to create a website for online sales. “Our commitment to our business is being out among the community, showing our wares and telling our stories. This, I’m afraid, will suffer this year,” she said. Thomas Sterner Union Mills resident Thomas Sterner, who sculpted the two green leaf shoots outside the old bank that is being renovated for Westminster’s new city administrative offices, was contracted for a new public art sculpture in Frederick. “Water Lily Wave” will be his largest public sculpture in size and cost. But although it was reviewed and approved by the city’s Parks and Recreation Department and the Public Art Commission, the Historical Preservation Commission has not been able to meet due to precautions. Sterner cannot begin the piece, and he said in an email that he’s “concerned the delay could be significant. Now would be a perfect time to be working on it.” “It will still happen, but the amount of delay is unknown and may be significant. I am a full-time artist, and a project like this has a significant financial impact and consumes all of my time (or none of it). I adjust, stay positive, and keep going,” he said. Players on Air Their production of the musical “1776” was scheduled for the weekend of March 13, but now local Community Theatre group Players on Air Inc. is out nearly $6,000 that they spent on the production elements of the show. To tell the story of the first Continental Congress, the group convened almost 25 male actors, a feat in the theatre world. Now, they have no idea if they would be able to reschedule in the future. The show itself is supposed to go back to Broadway, and the licensing company has told director and producer Laura Wonsala that they cannot guarantee that Players on Air will be able to acquire the rights for a rescheduled local performance. “All of the time and hard work we put into our production is up in the air right now,” she said in an email. “Many people are asking for refunds for tickets they purchased. We are trying to tell them that we will honor their tickets if we can reschedule or for another production in the future. The licensing company said they will refund our money, but that doesn’t even come close to what we put out for our production.”

Maryland’s confirmed coronavirus cases reach 8,936; 6 more Pleasant View Nursing Home residents die
.W
The number of confirmed new coronavirus cases and the related death toll continued to mount Monday in Maryland as the state reported its first death inside the correctional system and six more residents of a Mount Airy nursing home died. Maryland added 711 new cases Monday, bringing the total confirmed to 8,936, as testing becomes more available, the state health department announced Monday. The state’s death toll jumped by 27 to 262 people, including a man in his 60s who was being held at the Jessup Correctional Institution, according to state officials. The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services confirmed the man was hospitalized for several weeks and had underlying health conditions. He was one of 10 inmates at Jessup diagnosed with COVID-19. There are a total of 93 confirmed cases in the Maryland correctional system. Attorneys and health officials in Baltimore and around the state have repeatedly called on Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan to act swiftly to release older and nonviolent inmates as the outbreak spreads. In mid-March, experts said that “jails and prisons promote spread” due to the close contact inmates have with one another in the facilities. At Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, 24 residents are now dead and dozens more residents and staff members are infected. While the cluster at the Carroll County facility is particularly deadly — nearly one in four residents have died so far — at least 90 such facilities in Maryland have at least one confirmed case of COVID-19. The nursing home outbreaks prompted Hogan to create “strike teams” to support their staffs and mandate more rigorous testing and use of protective gear. Hogan took his plea for billions more in aid to state governments to the White House, making a pitch to Vice President Mike Pence during a Monday conference call. “The COVID-19 response is resulting in catastrophic damage to state economies, and fiscal assistance is critical now so that we can continue to lead this fight,” Hogan, a Republican, said in a statement issued after a conference call between the White House and the nation’s governors. Hogan said he asked Trump administration officials to help break a “logjam” in the Senate that he says is holding up aid to the states. Hogan is chairman of the National Governors Association. Over the weekend, Hogan and the association vice chairman, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a joint statement calling on the federal government to send more cash to the states. At a media briefing Monday, President Donald Trump acknowledged Hogan’s request and said he appreciated it. Pence later commended Hogan during the briefing for the actions he has taken to help slow the spread of the coronavirus in nursing homes. State governments are grappling with increased expenses for their response to the coronavirus pandemic at the same time that they’re taking in drastically less money in taxes, as people have been thrown out of work and aren’t spending as much. One worst-case scenario from Maryland’s comptroller predicted the state could lose up to $2.8 billion in tax revenue through the end of June if the current stay-at-home order remains in place that long. Speaking Monday on CNN, Hogan said he thought the administration was “generally” supportive of getting more aid to the states. Hogan told host Anderson Cooper that he also has spoken to Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about his request. Asked for comment, the White House released a statement attributed to a coronavirus task force spokesman that said: "We look forward to further discussions with governors on how we can continue to work together on the locally executed, state managed, and federally supported response efforts.” In Maryland, some state leaders are continuing their pleas to Hogan for more detailed data on the known cases of COVID-19. Del. Nick J. Mosby called on Hogan last week to release coronavirus case data by race and ZIP code. The governor announced Sunday that the state would begin posting COVID-19 cases by ZIP code “so that Marylanders can better understand the spread of this deadly virus.” In a statement Monday, Mosby thanked Hogan and his administration for responding to the request, but said Marylanders are still missing “pertinent” data broken down by ZIP code including the number of positive and negative test results, the number of hospitalizations and number of deaths. “Without a complete picture of the zip code data, it is difficult to understand the totality of this virus and develop a comprehensive plan of action," Mosby said. State officials confirmed the 21215 ZIP code covering portions of Northwest Baltimore’s Arlington neighborhood has the highest case count in the state, with more than 153 cases found. Prince George’s and Montgomery counties continue to lead all other Maryland counties in overall cases, reporting 2,205 and 1,756 cases, respectively. In Prince George’s County, ZIP codes including 20706, 20744, 20772, 20774 and 20747 have a reported 143, 132, 124, 120, and 115 cases, respectively. State officials also identified three ZIP codes in Montgomery County — 20904, 20902 and 20906 — as hot spots, with 137, 135 and 134 news cases each. Baltimore County’s 21234 ZIP code, covering areas of Parkville, reported 118 cases. There are 103 cases in the Mount Airy ZIP code of 21771 where the Pleasant View Nursing Home is located. While ZIP code data is being shared in an effort to be transparent, Carroll County Health Officer Ed Singer said there are some key points people should understand when they see such numbers. “Mount Airy has high numbers, but most of the cases in that area are from the nursing home outbreak there,” Singer said. "And even if you live in an area with a low number of cases, you still need to take all the same precautions, because the coronavirus is spreading throughout the county. We know the stay at home order is a burden, but we are counting on everyone to continue social distancing to protect our community.” The Maryland Department of Health reported Monday that more than 42,815 people have tested negative for COVID-19. The state said 1,975 people have been hospitalized because of the virus and 603 have been released from isolation. The confirmed cases and related deaths continue to be disproportionately black, with 39% of confirmed cases where the race is known found in African American residents, despite being 29% of the population, state data shows. They also account for about half the fatal cases where race is known. The state still has incomplete racial demographic data, as the health department could not provide such information for 1,667 cases throughout the state, including 28 fatal infections. Women continue to account for more COVID-19 cases than men, 4,831 compared with 4,105. However, 145 men have died as a result of the infections compared with 117 women.

Despite criticism in the media, federal coronavirus task force briefings have proven useful | READER COMMENTARY
.W
Recently, I’ve read articles in The Baltimore Sun that describe the Trump administration’s response to COVID-19. Some of those articles from Sun columnists and readers use the words “pathetic,” “slow,” “not credible” and “irresponsible.” I’m really not sure where these writers are getting their information. I’ve watched the daily presidential coronavirus task force briefings for the past several months and I see a much different picture (“Fact-checking Trump on coronavirus science, from drugs to disinfectants to testing,” April 25). Dr. Anthony Fauci, Ambassador-at-Large Deborah Birx, Adm. Brett P. Giroir of the U.S. Public Health Service, Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen Hahn, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams and others in the daily briefings present a clear, straightforward picture of this unprecedented situation and what is being done to address it. Their work and information dissemination has been anything but pathetic. The medical professionals continue their critical work and have been joined by industry leaders. Input from both of these perspectives and from the numerous conference calls with governors of the states and territories is critical to intelligently addressing this problem and safely reopening the states. From what I have seen, this is happening. Tom Horrigan, Baltimore Add your voice: Respond to this piece or other Sun content by submitting your own letter.

ZIP code-level data on Maryland coronavirus cases shows hot spots, transmission in many Baltimore neighborhoods
.W
Some of Maryland’s highest concentrations of confirmed coronavirus infections are occurring around Baltimore’s Park Heights neighborhood and into Baltimore County’s northwest corridor, and the virus is “clearly spreading” in many other neighborhoods throughout the city, according to the first ZIP code-level data on COVID-19 cases in the state. Data released Sunday shows more cases in the city’s 21215 ZIP code — 137 — than any other in the state, and concentrations of dozens of cases in the Pikesville and Randallstown areas. But the virus is not limited to those hot spots, with clusters of infections also reported along the Belair Road corridor in Northeast Baltimore and down the city’s east side. “It’s clearly spreading,” said Joshua Sharfstein, a former city health commissioner. “This is a beeping warning light that there is community transmission right now in Baltimore.” Elsewhere around the state, the Silver Spring area, the Prince George’s County suburbs of Washington and the Frederick area are also hot spots for spread of the infection known as COVID-19. The data is helping to inform efforts to protect vulnerable residents, feed families in need and control the spread of the virus that as of Sunday has infected more than 8,200 Marylanders, and killed 235. The state released the ZIP code driven information amid calls that it ensure that resources to combat the pandemic are applied equitably, given that a racial breakdown of cases released last week showed a disproportionate toll on black residents. State Del. Nick Mosby, whose legislative district includes parts of west and northwest Baltimore and had been calling on Gov. Larry Hogan to release the ZIP code data, said the numbers underscore that all residents need equal access to coronavirus testing, protective equipment and other measures that slow the virus’ spread. “No matter how rich, how poor, no matter what part of the state, no matter what your line of work is, it’s a virus and it spreads,” Mosby said. “That’s why it’s so important to ensure we’re equitable in effectively flattening the curve.” Hogan said the data is helping to inform where investment and precautions are most needed. In Northwest Baltimore, that included the launch of a testing center at Pimlico Race Course last week. In Park Heights, George Mitchell said he has recently noticed more people wearing masks and maintaining 6 feet of distance from others when he serves them at the Langston Hughes Community, Business & Resource Center on Tuesdays and Fridays. About 500 people, twice as many usual, visited the food pantry there on Tuesday, he said. Mitchell was glad to see people taking better precautions. Though he said he doesn’t personally know of any COVID-19 cases in the community, he said he is nonetheless urging people to take the coronavirus seriously. “I’m telling people, ‘This thing is real,’” Mitchell said. “We’ve got to isolate and make sure exactly where it’s coming from.” The neighborhood was quiet on Easter Sunday. The dark green COVID-19 testing tents at Pimlico Racecourse were desolate. Those walking in the largely empty streets were mostly alone. Small groups appeared to be keeping their distance. People sitting outside their homes, chatting with neighbors from porch to porch, mainly wore masks. A barbecue stand at the corner of Reisterstown Road and Hayward Avenue had a steady stream of customers. A group of about 15 people launched a motorcycle ride nearby, apparently taking advantage of the overcast, warm weather. Mosby stressed that Park Heights and many other neighborhoods simply aren’t equipped to defend against the virus. Many residents rely on public transportation, making social distancing difficult if not impossible, and work in low-wage and low-skill jobs once overlooked, but now essential. “Everyone’s relying on them,” the Democratic lawmaker said Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “What are we doing to protect them?” Neighborhoods that were already considered “food deserts” for lack of affordable and healthy groceries are now faced with choices between exposing themselves to the virus or going hungry, said Kea Crowder, co-founder of the Movement Team. The community group has been distributing meal kits and care packages in neighborhoods all across the city through a COVID-19 grant from the Baltimore Community Foundation. “A lot of folks don’t want to venture out,” she said. “Others don’t have means to get anything.” While the ZIP code data shows where some coronavirus hot spots are, it is not a perfect measure of the virus’ prevalence, noted Sharfstein, the vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He said it can sometimes simply reflect greater access to testing. Also, ZIP codes are not uniform in size or population, making comparisons difficult. Though the 21215 ZIP code has the state’s highest number of coronavirus cases, the rate of infection there, about 2.3 cases per 1,000 residents, is lower than in other postal codes. Factoring in population data, the virus appears to be even more prevalent in Randallstown, where the confirmed infection rate is approaching 3 per 1,000 residents, and Pikesville, at 2.4 cases per 1,000 residents. Even more of an outlier: An infection rate of 3.5 people per 1,000 in the Mount Airy ZIP code that includes Pleasant View Nursing Home, where at least 81 residents and 31 staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus. High numbers of confirmed infections are appearing most frequently in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. Across nine Prince George’s County ZIP codes, there are nearly 1,000 confirmed cases, accounting for about 12% of the statewide total. And the Maryland ZIP codes with the second-, third- and fourth-most confirmed COVID-19 infections are all in the Silver Spring area of Montgomery County, totaling more than 380 cases. More useful than confirmed case counts by ZIP code, granular data on the demographics of people being hospitalized or who die from COVID-19 could more accurately reveal where the virus is spreading most rapidly, Sharfstein said. Maryland health officials release breakdowns of confirmed cases and deaths county by county, and by age, gender and race, but only statewide totals of the numbers of people who are hospitalized or who have recovered from infection and been released from isolation. Sharfstein said the data should not suggest any reason to ease alarm in Baltimore ZIP codes where fewer COVID-19 cases have been confirmed. “There’s no breathing a sigh of relief in data that shows the virus is spreading across the city,” he said. “It shows that it’s very important that access to testing and care be available across the city.” Baltimore Sun reporter McKenna Oxenden contributed to this article.

Maryland hospitals allowed to raise rates to pay for surge of coronavirus patients
.W
Hospitals in Maryland will be allowed to temporarily raise rates charged to all patients as a means of funding emergency and ongoing care for patients during the coronavirus pandemic, state regulators said. They also will be able to bypass normal regulatory steps needed to make changes such as adding extra beds. The move was expected because hospitals will have extra costs related to a surge of patients. They also have been forgoing revenue as they cut elective care to make room for patients with the COVID-19 illness. The rates hospitals charge patients for everything from surgery to giving birth in Maryland are tightly regulated by the state, but hospitals have had to move quickly to add beds and acquire ventilators and masks and other protective equipment, officials said. Health Services Cost Review Commission just informed the hospitals about the emergency funding, which hospitals will need to show is reasonable, officials said. No approvals have been granted yet and there is no estimate for the costs. “If the number of coronavirus cases continues to increase, hospitals will need additional financial resources to further expand capacity,” said Adam Kane, chairman of commission, in a statement. “Our agency is taking action now to ensure hospitals are appropriately funded and ready for the potential surge of patients.” State officials also expect to get some federal funding to offset costs for care. Other state agencies also are removing licensing and regulatory barriers to speed the process of adding beds at the hospitals, some of which have already announced plans, including Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore and Northwest Hospital in Randallstown. “We are preparing for an increase in cases of novel coronavirus, and we want hospitals and health care systems to be ready,” said Robert Neall, Maryland’s health secretary, in a statement. “Maryland will pursue federal funding to help supplement the costs associated with the expanded care and resources that may be needed to care for Marylanders affected by this pandemic.”

Maryland announces 47 more coronavirus-related deaths, pushing victim count to 631
.W
Maryland’s confirmed death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 631 Wednesday, with the state reporting 47 more victims of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Although the deaths were reported Wednesday, they could have occurred any number of days prior. Twenty-six people in Maryland are confirmed as having died from the virus Tuesday, per the state. That marks the state’s fewest single-day deaths since April 7. Adding to that count are another 67 victims whose deaths were believed to be caused by COVID-19, though a laboratory test never confirmed they had the coronavirus. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford cautioned that the coronavirus pandemic is a serious matter, as he opened an online meeting of the state’s Board of Public Works. He noted that this winter’s seasonal flu caused 62 deaths through April. In just the first month of the coronavirus pandemic, the virus caused 206 deaths — and that number has continued to rise, now topping 600 deaths. “So for those who think this pandemic is no more than a bad flu season, they are badly mistaken,” said Rutherford, a Republican. “We are in a challenging time. It’s not quite over yet.” Maryland has confirmed 14,775 cases of the virus total, with 582 of those reported Wednesday. That keeps Maryland from what would’ve been a second straight daily drop in new cases. Gov. Larry Hogan has been adamant he will follow the guidelines from President Donald Trump that states should not begin their reopening process until their daily counts of new cases decrease for 14 straight days. Maryland has yet to exceed two consecutive days in which the number of new confirmed cases was lower than the day prior. It’s possible that Maryland’s count of confirmed cases will see a spike in the near future as the 500,000 coronavirus tests Hogan and his wife, Yumi, acquired from South Korea get put to use. Increased testing will likely inflate the state’s number of confirmed cases, but improved testing capability is also one of four aspects of Hogan’s plan for the state’s recovery and reopening. The state reported new 2,885 test results Wednesday, a 4% increase from Tuesday’s total. There are 1,432 infected currently hospitalized in Maryland, with 527 of them in intensive care. The state reported that 981 overall have been released from isolation, 51 more than Tuesday’s reported total. Among the infected whose race is known, African Americans account for more than 46% of the state’s cases and deaths. Race data has not been reported in about one-fifth of cases statewide. More than one in every six cases of the coronavirus in a Marylander over 80 years old has resulted in death. Almost 88% of the state’s victims whose ages have been reported were at least 60, though those 59 and younger represent more than two-thirds of the case total.

Larry Hogan on Wednesday ordered universal coronavirus testing at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities after hundreds of deaths at those sites and calls on state government to better protect its most vulnerable residents. After ramping up testing capacity ― something the state has struggled with for weeks ― Hogan said he is taking a number of actions to try to stop the spread of the virus from ravaging senior-living facilities across the state. The testing will include all staff and residents, whether they display symptoms of illness or not. Speaking from the State House in Annapolis, the Republican governor said he also was mandating that nursing homes accept the assistance of the state’s so-called strike teams, which have provided medical help to more than 80 facilities, after reports some had turned the teams away. The governor said he was requiring daily evaluations by doctors of nursing home residents. “We are increasingly concerned and quite frankly, outraged, that a few operators are not complying with directives from the state,” Hogan said. To help the strike teams, Hogan said he was creating new so-called bridge teams, which will provide emergency clinical staffing to nursing homes that need workers. The bridge teams will include 260 registered nurses, the governor said. Hogan also announced the appointment of Col. Eric Allely, the state surgeon of the Maryland National Guard, to serve as an emergency safety and compliance officer for nursing homes. His task is to ensure they comply with state law and safety protocols during the crisis. “We are no longer just playing defense. We are going on offense against this virus, attacking it from every angle with everything we’ve got,” the governor said. Hogan’s move to provide universal testing comes nearly a month after nursing homes advocates and others said much more testing was necessary to curb the spread of the virus in elder care facilities. State health officials believe the disease spread into the facilities carried by asymptomatic staffers who sometimes work in multiple nursing homes. But the state, like the nation, has been hamstrung by a lack of critical testing supplies and stringent guidelines on who could and could not be tested. After weeks of pressure, the state began releasing information Tuesday about infections and deaths at Maryland nursing homes. So far, more than 50% of the state’s confirmed deaths from COVID-19 have been connected to nursing homes. And at least six nursing homes have more than 100 cases, according to the new data. Nursing home administrators have pressed the state to expand testing and help them obtain protective equipment, such as masks and gowns. Joe DeMattos, president of the Health Facilities Association of Maryland, said access to testing has become increasingly important as outbreaks have revealed the extent to which asymptomatic staff members spread the virus, despite proper use of protective equipment and other measures. But testing remained limited unless residents or staff showed signs of illness. “To the extent that we can follow through on testing all nursing home staff, residents and patients, we are taking important and giant steps forward,” DeMattos said. “It’s going to have to be systematic.” The addition of the teams of nurses also could help facilities manage outbreaks better than the “strike teams," DeMattos added. The strike teams have helped stabilize emerging outbreaks, but only provide brief support and limited testing, he said. Many nursing homes are dealing with chronic staffing and equipment shortages. Del. Shane Pendergrass, who chairs a House of Delegates’ health committee, said she became concerned recently when she learned nursing homes weren’t doing universal testing. She had been under the impression that the strike teams were doing widespread testing at nursing homes. Without knowing which residents and employees might have the virus, it’s impossible to keep it from spreading among vulnerable seniors, said Pendergrass, a Howard County Democrat. “If it gets in, it’s deadly. They need to do everything they can,” Pendergrass said. “I’m so glad we’re improving what we’re doing.” The state has taken steps to try to limit transmission of the virus in nursing homes, but the virus has continued to spread and sicken residents. In early March, the state asked nursing homes to restrict visitors and employee travel. By early April, the state required nursing home workers to wear masks at all times. The mandated testing at nursing homes is now possible because of the state’s increased testing capacity. Hogan said 500,000 new tests the state recently purchased from a South Korean company would help expand testing to better address the state’s virus “hot spots.” Hogan also said Wednesday that the Eastern Shore’s poultry processing plants have emerged as hot spots for coronavirus infections and deaths. The governor said there are 262 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections among poultry workers in Maryland. As with meatpacking plants in other parts of the country, there are concerns that the virus is sickening employees who work close together butchering and processing chickens and other birds at plants on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia and in lower Delaware. Meat shortages could result from plant closures. In response, the state is opening a testing site at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium, a minor league baseball stadium in Salisbury. Millions of chickens in Maryland and Delaware were slated to be destroyed instead of processed due to staff shortages at the plants during the pandemic. The governor’s new orders came as the coronavirus death toll in Maryland neared 1,000, with the state reporting 56 new confirmed victims in Wednesday’s daily update. There have been nearly 21,000 confirmed cases in the state. Hogan also addressed problems with the state’s unemployment website, which has crashed as many users tried to file claims. He said the state is processing more than 700 claims an hour, but those efforts are not good enough. “The people of Maryland deserve better and the buck stops with me,” he said. Hogan also said other states are ignoring federal guidelines to wait until they have 14 days of declining coronavirus data before reopening. He said he planned to revisit in May whether the virus is weakening in Maryland and the state can begin reopening.

Monitoring coronavirus, Carroll County Health Department prepares response team, focuses on prevention
.W
The coronavirus disease that was first detected in China has spread to the United States, and even before the first cases were reported in Maryland on Thursday evening, the Carroll County Health Department has been readying the people who would respond to a potential outbreak in the area. “The best thing that we can do is plan and be prepared," Ed Singer, county health officer, told the Board of County Commissioners at its Thursday meeting. The respiratory disease has sickened about 100,000 globally, as of Wednesday. Nationally, more than 220 people have been infected with COVID-19 and 12 people have died, almost all in Washington state. In Maryland, the state’s first three cases were confirmed Thursday evening. Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement, “The patients, who contracted the virus while traveling overseas, are in good condition.” Thirty-one people had been tested in the state as of Thursday morning, with 17 reported to be negative. Symptoms of the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia​​, according to the state health department. In response to the situation, the county health department has a weekly conference call with the Maryland Department of Health, which is communicating with the CDC, according to Singer, and email communications are going back and forth as new information arises. “There’s an extensive amount of coordination between the Centers for Disease Control, the local health departments and the Maryland Department of Health. It’s getting to the point where this is an all-hands-on deck type of thing," Singer said. Valerie Hawkins, the county’s manager for emergency management, is working in tandem with Singer. In response to COVID-19, the county’s emergency operations center was raised to an enhanced level Thursday morning, Hawkins said, meaning staff are actively managing the situation. Emergency management has also reinvigorated its emerging infectious diseases (EID) group, which was set up several years ago when the Ebola virus disease came about, according to Hawkins. The EID group includes firefighters, emergency medical services providers, members of law enforcement, the Humane Society of Carroll County, social services, schools, and special populations such as people in assisted living facilities. Hawkins said the goal of the group is to make sure people have the information they need from credible sources. The county health department activated its health department operations center (HDOC), Singer said. Maggie Kunz, health planner for the department, wrote in an email that activating the HDOC means specific staff are working together to coordinate internal planning and communication in response to the COVID-19 situation. To keep information “credible, consistent, and coordinated,” Kunz said the health department is forming a virtual joint information center in which public information officers from across the county can communicate. Singer told the commissioners that the health department has been getting calls about the disease from concerned citizens. Outside the meeting, Singer estimated they’ve received between six and 15 calls a day over the past month. During the meeting, Singer said several groups have asked the health department to come speak about the disease, but it would be difficult to fulfill every request. Kunz suggested a Facebook Live forum as a solution. Later this month, there will be a meeting among the county health department, emergency management and community partners to discuss the situation, according to Singer. Hawkins hopes the county’s effort can “cut down on the social media rumor mill that has a tendency to crop up in situations like this.” Singer urged citizens to look to the websites of the county health department, the state health department, and the CDC. The Carroll County Health Department can be reached at 410-876-2152. If someone suspects they have COVID-19 or came into contact with someone who might have it, Singer said, they should seek treatment through their health care provider, and the county health department will determine whether that person meets the criteria to be tested. Singer emphasized the importance of washing hands with soap and water to prevent the spread of disease. He recommends people adopt the habit of washing their hands when they get home and encourage their children to do the same. If soap and water is not available, Singer said to use hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. “To put this in perspective though, there have been over 3,000 hospitalizations, 40 adult deaths, five pediatric deaths in Maryland related to flu" since October, Singer said. “While we want to be prepared and make sure we’re ready to deal with this emerging infection, it’s important to put it in perspective, and it’s important that we plan and that we do everything we can to protect our population.” Singer reminded the commissioners that they have the power to adopt regulations to control the spread of disease, such as restricting large gatherings of people, though there is currently no indication that they will. The Baltimore Sun contributed to this report.

FDA authorizes a 3-hour coronavirus test for hospitals developed in Baltimore County
.W
One of the latest coronavirus tests to earn tentative FDA approval was developed in Baltimore County by scientists at biotechnology company Becton Dickinson. The company said Friday the Food and Drug Administration gave “emergency use authorization” for a test its Sparks-based unit BD Integrated Diagnostic Solutions worked on with BioGX, an Alabama-based biotech company. The test runs on a system already in place in 600 hospitals and other labs across the country, used to test for sexually transmitted infections, enteric bacteria and parasites, and hospital-borne pathogens. It will allow those hospitals to use the systems, known as BD MAX, to also detect the virus causing COVID-19 infections, providing results in two or three hours without the need to send samples to outside labs, company officials said. A research and development team at BD’s Baltimore County facilities was “instrumental” in developing the test, said Dave Hickey, president of diagnostic systems at BD. And the tests are being manufactured at the company’s Sparks campus. BD employs about 1,700 people in Sparks and Hunt Valley, Hickey said. Hickey said the company expects to distribute as many as 900,000 of the tests a month. The FDA is allowing the test to be used as long as the coronavirus pandemic remains a national emergency, but has not formally approved it. BD, working with partner companies in China and Europe, has already sold similar tests used in outbreaks in those areas. Under similar emergency approval, BD and North Carolina-based company BioMedomics have also launched a blood test that can detect whether a patient has developed an immune response, and potentially immunity, to the coronavirus. Known as serology tests, they are expected to be key when the country eventually relaxes social distancing rules that have been ordered to slow the coronavirus pandemic. A sales and marketing team at BD’s Sparks campus will work to promote that test, Hickey said.

Carroll County landfills see hundreds of visitors in one day, sparking concern amid coronavirus
.W
While more people have been staying home, Carroll County landfills have experienced a recent influx of visitors, raising concerns about how to provide an essential service while limiting potential exposure to the coronavirus. Although several county facilities have closed to the public amidst the pandemic, Northern Landfill in Westminster and Hoods Mill Landfill in Woodbine remain open on their regular hours. The disposal of waste is considered an essential service, according to the governor’s orders relating to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. During a meeting of the Board of County Commissioners held remotely through the internet March 26, Commissioner Stephen Wantz, R-District 1, expressed concern over the increase of people at landfills. “I believe they saw upwards of 1,000 people last weekend,” he said. “Seeing 1,000 people means they actually interacted with those [dump staff] folks.” On March 27, the county issued a news release recommending customers pay by credit card only at the Northern Landfill and discouraging trips that are not immediately necessary. “To help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our community, residents and businesses of Carroll County are asked to avoid all non-essential outings and close contact,” the release reads. “Also, although the Northern Landfill remains open, residents with non-perishable waste not requiring immediate disposal, are asked to not bring it to the county solid waste facilities at this time.” The release suggests waiting until the state of emergency is lifted or contracting with a local hauler to dispose of waste and recycling. A list of licensed haulers can be found on the county’s website at County Residential Curb-side Haulers or through your local phone directory. Health professionals and public officials are urging people to practice social distancing to limit the spread of COVID-19, and to stay six feet apart when around others. Dwight Amoss, county landfill manager, said 631 paying customers drove across the scales at the Northern Landfill to drop off trash March 21, and 278 did the same at Hoods Mill. That does not count those who came to dispose of recycling, metal or yard waste, he said. “This place has been a madhouse ever since they started shutting things down,” Amoss said in an interview. “It can be a little stressful.” Looking around the Northern Landfill on Thursday afternoon, Amoss said he saw seven pickup trucks in line waiting to dispose of waste by the dumpster area, as well as about 14 people unloading at the yard waste pile. Spring is usually the busiest time of year anyway, Amoss said, but he believes it’s busier than usual because of COVID-19. He suspects people stuck at home are cleaning more inside their homes and out in their yards, especially if they are unable to work. Cliff Engle, bureau chief of solid waste, agreed with Amoss. “More people are home and we believe that’s part of the contributing factor to the traffic being increased at the landfill,” Engle said in an interview. Amoss and Engle said they’ve heard concerns from staff who interact with the public at the landfills. Engle said the closest interactions occur when customers make payments after weighing their waste. Employees are sanitizing the facility and keeping their distance from others when they can, according to Engle. He said they want to keep staff and customers safe. “It’s definitely uncharted territory we’re all trying to work in,” he said. During the commissioners meeting, Wantz suggested a solution be found so county staff working at the landfill can continue to provide services while limiting their exposure to large amounts of people. Wantz also attributed the increase to people spending more time at home. “We’re cleaning out closets, we’re getting things done around the home that we typically wouldn’t do as we’re all working,” he said. “We can’t close the landfill, so we’ve got to make some very different decisions out there." Staff are developing alternative methods to keep landfill employees and customers safe, according to Wantz. No official decisions regarding the landfills were made Thursday, but the commissioners plan to discuss the situation during their March 31 meeting, which begins at 9 a.m.

I think I have coronavirus symptoms. Now what?
.W
As Maryland officials confirmed three cases of the new coronavirus in the state this week, healthcare experts have instructed people to adopt myriad preventative measures in hopes of containing the disease. But what should Marylanders do if they suspect they have been exposed to COVID-19 or are have symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing trouble? Here’s what experts recommend if you believe you could have the disease: Don’t go to the doctor right away. Call first. While some Marylanders’ first instinct may be to make an appointment with a doctor or head to a hospital, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging people to call ahead first to alert healthcare providers to coronavirus concerns. This will help medical professionals to take steps to keep others from getting infected or exposed, the agency website states. Tell them about recent travel and close contacts, such as other members of the household. If possible, put on a face mask before coming into contact with other people or entering a facility and ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department. In the event of a medical emergency, people should call 911 and notify the dispatch personnel that they are being evaluated for COVID-19, the CDC recommends. Getting tested To request COVID-19 testing for a suspect case, healthcare providers must contact the state’s Infectious Disease Bureau at 410-767-6700 during business hours or call the state’s Emergency Call Center after hours at 410-795-7365 to arrange the initial disease consultation, according to Maryland health officials. COVID-19 testing can only be conducted with authorization from a state physician–epidemiologist and is restricted to patients who meet the current CDC criteria, which was recently expanded to include people who have not traveled or come in contact with someone infected but are hospitalized with serious symptoms not otherwise explained. Health officials will likely collect patient specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the three Maryland cases, the patients were instructed to go to an unidentified hospital emergency room where medical staff in protective equipment collected samples for testing. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday night that the three cases were confirmed at the Public Health Laboratory in East Baltimore, which was approved Tuesday to test patients for COVID-19. Local testing is expected to shorten the amount of time it takes to get results to a day from the several days it took from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab in Atlanta. Okay I’ve been tested. Now what? The three Marylanders who tested positive for the new coronavirus are all in isolation in their homes, state officials said. The CDC recommends patients with COVID-19 stay home with the exception of seeking medical care. Patients should not attend work or school and should avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing and taxis, the CDC recommends. Those who have self-isolated within the home should separate from other people and animals. Wearing a face mask, covering coughs and sneezes is believed to help mitigate the spread of the infection. The CDC recommends individuals who are ill should avoid sharing personal household items, clean hands often, clean all “high-touch” surfaces like counters and door knobs. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 should remain under home isolation precautions until the risk of secondary transmission to others is thought to be low. The decision to discontinue home isolation precautions should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments, the CDC states.

Second coronavirus death at Carroll Lutheran Village announced; more cases confirmed at Westminster Healthcare Center
.W
The Carroll County Health Department has announced another death from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, along with 18 more cases since Tuesday. Carroll County’s overall total is at 270 cases and 32 deaths Wednesday. Long-term care facilities account for 159 of the confirmed cases in the county, and 28 of the 32 deaths have been residents of such facilities. A second resident of Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster was reported Wednesday to have died. In total, 31 residents and seven staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus at that location. Four more residents at Westminster Healthcare Center have tested positive, bringing the total to nine, spokesperson Fred Stratmann confirmed Wednesday. Two employees there have tested positive as well, he said, though there have been no deaths. It was unclear whether these figures are included in the county data. The Pleasant View Nursing Home outbreak in Mount Airy is still the largest concentration of cases in Carroll County, having infected 82 residents and 39 staff members. As of Wednesday, 24 residents had died, representing the majority of Carroll countians who have died. “Community” cases — in other words, those not tied to a long-term care facility — rose to 111 from 103, it including 53 women and 58 men. There have been four fatalities and 16 hospitalizations in this group. Twenty-nine have recovered and been released from isolation, an increase of four over the previous day. Of the 111 cases not at a long-term care facility, two are between the ages of 10 and 19; 20 are between ages 20 and 29; 10 are between ages 30 and 39; 15 between ages 40 and 49; 41 between ages 50 and 59; 13 between ages 60 and 69; six between ages 70 and 79; and four between ages 80 and 89. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities are particularly vulnerable after an outbreak because the disease is most likely to cause serious illness or death in those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. The state’s largest outbreak as of Wednesday was also in a long-term care facility, with officials reporting 170 confirmed cases among residents and staff at FutureCare Lochearn in Baltimore. Also on Wednesday Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order that, starting Saturday, customers and employees should wear face masks while in stores or using public transportation. The Carroll County Health Department and Board of County Commissioners supported the measure in a news release Wednesday, issuing strong recommendations that residents wear a cloth face covering in all public settings where social distancing is difficult. Residents should wear homemade cloth masks or face coverings, the release states, and surgical and N-95 masks should be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders. They should fit snugly, cover the nose and mouth, have multiple layers of fabric, and be washable, according to the release. When removing a mask, people should avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth. Infected people who do not show symptoms may still spread the coronavirus, and wearing a cloth face covering helps to protect others, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Using face coverings does not mean social distancing can be halted, the release states. Residents should still abide by Hogan’s stay-at-home order and continue to maintain a safe distance from others when out at the grocery store or other essential businesses, according to the release. “My face covering protects you, and your face covering protects me,” Ed Singer, Carroll County health officer, said in the release. “Carroll County is seeing significant community spread of COVID-19. Cloth face coverings are an important way to help slow the spread in our community — another easy way to save lives.” Guidance from the CDC on face coverings can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html.

To soothe coronavirus concerns, consider Franz Schubert | READER COMMENTARY
.W
Dan Rodricks says his brother Joe is smarter than he is. But he’s just as smart to pass on Joe’s recommendation of music by Franz Schubert to temper our sense of isolation in these precarious times (“Coronavirus watch: Keeping human touch while isolated," March 17). I would add another Schubert work to the list: his Symphony no. 9 in C Major for large orchestra. Alternately sweet, startling, eloquent, tragic and grand, it plays the orchestra for all it is worth, urging the listener forward in both fast and slow portions for nearly an hour. The last section even includes a quotation from Beethoven’s Symphony no. 9, which the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra will perform in June, the city’s health permitting. You can hear both Beethoven and Schubert in the latter’s work. Franz Schubert recognized and drew on the humanity of his symphonic predecessor to help hand posterity the strength and the humanity we urgently need.

More than 1/4 of Baltimore coronavirus deaths involve nursing home residents, new data show
.W
More than one-fourth of Baltimore deaths attributed to the new coronavirus involved nursing home residents, city data shows. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced Tuesday an expanded online dashboard that provides the most sweeping data to date on the coronavirus’ impact in Baltimore. It provides new information on the percentage of available ventilators being used by city hospitals and additional data on the number of negative and positive tests by ZIP code. And it shows that, of the 80 people who have died of the disease in Baltimore, 23 were nursing home residents. The city has nearly 2,000 confirmed cases. Baltimore’s extra level of detail regarding nursing homes comes a day after the state announced it would begin releasing data on coronavirus infections and deaths at long-term care facilities later this week. State officials previously denied requests for that information, saying disclosing the number of cases would would compromise patients’ right to privacy and serve “no public health purpose.” Baltimore saw a massive outbreak of COVID-19 at the FutureCare Lochearn nursing home, where at least 129 residents and 41 staffers tested positive for COVID-19 infection. The facility is in the 21215 ZIP code, the hardest hit in the city so far. Other insights provided by the updated Baltimore coronavirus dashboard include: > Black people account for at least 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Across the country, the African American community has suffered disproportionately from the disease. > People between the ages of 30 and 39 account for the largest share of the city’s cases, with 355. > The city’s hospitals are using about one-third of their ventilators, and 75% of their ICU space. > Baltimore has run more than 1,300 tests at its three testing sites. > About one-fifth of tests come back positive. “The data will be used to ensure our pandemic response is equitable across geographic and demographic lines," said Baltimore Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa. “Nursing homes and other long-term facilities remain a top priority.”

Maryland surpasses 100 coronavirus-related deaths; state looks to lease ice rink as makeshift morgue
.W
Nearly three weeks since the new coronavirus claimed its first victim in Maryland, the state announced it has surpassed 100 deaths caused by COVID-19. Tuesday’s announcement of 12 additional deaths brought the state’s coronavirus-related death toll to 103, an increase of about 54% in the past two days. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Maryland’s first death caused by the virus March 18. The state announced an additional 326 confirmed cases of the virus overall, bringing Maryland to at least 4,371 cases statewide. The state has issued 27,256 negative tests for COVID-19, while 288 people who tested positive have since been released from isolation. With the state entering triple digits in deaths, Mike Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, confirmed state officials are seeking to lease an ice rink to use as a makeshift morgue. No lease is finalized, said Ricci, who cited a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention checklist that suggests finding locations that can serve to expand morgue capacity. “This is a precautionary measure as part of our planning process, and it is consistent with CDC guidance for preparedness,” Ricci said in a statement. Hogan, at a news conference in Baltimore Monday afternoon, said the ice rinks are only a possibility — one that he hopes to avoid by slowing the spread of the virus. “It’s just something that is being considered,” Hogan, a Republican, told reporters. Prince George’s County became the state’s first jurisdiction with at least 1,000 confirmed cases at 1,020, with Montgomery County’s 871, Baltimore County’s 652 and Baltimore City’s 459 following. More than 10% of the confirmed 159 cases in Carroll County, where there was an outbreak at Pleasant View Nursing Home, have resulted in death. About 70% of Maryland’s confirmed cases are in people under the age of 60, and those under 30 make up nearly one in seven cases. Women represent 53.3% of the confirmed cases. Maryland does not yet announce its coronavirus case and death counts by race. Baltimore Sun reporter Luke Broadwater contributed to this article.

Poultry industry coronavirus cases continue to increase on Maryland’s Eastern Shore
.W
The Eastern Shore poultry industry continues to see an increase in coronavirus among its workers, pushing up infection rates in the region. A total of 279 workers in the poultry industry have tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials announced Friday. The state has set up testing sites at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium in Salisbury and in Caroline County. The outbreaks associated with the poultry industry have caused Wicomico County’s infection rate to rise to the fourth in the state, surpassing Baltimore City and Baltimore County, according to Gov. Larry Hogan’s office. Wicomico, home to the Salisbury headquarters of Perdue Farms and other poultry businesses, has 425 confirmed cases and seven deaths among a population of about 103,000 people. Perdue Farms is Wicomico’s third-largest employer, with 1,600 workers, according to state data. Neighboring Sussex County in Delaware, also with significant ties to the poultry industry, has more than 2,200 confirmed cases and 58 deaths. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent a team to help with the response to the virus, and leaders from Maryland, Delaware and Virginia have met to discuss issues in the industry. “This remains a rapidly evolving situation, and we will continue to keep Eastern Shore residents informed about these outbreaks in their area,” Hogan, a Republican, said in a statement Friday morning.

In response to coronavirus, McDaniel College announces restrictions, is planning for spring break travel
.W
McDaniel College has announced restrictions and guidelines it has implemented in response to the spreading coronavirus. Any students at the Westminster college who travel on a cruise ship or who are returning from a country designated by the State Department Travel Advisory as Level 2, 3, or 4 because of the coronavirus will not be allowed to return to the campus until self-quarantining for 14 days, spokeswoman Cheryl Knauer said Tuesday. This is in addition to a prohibition on international travel affiliated with the college. When asked how many students this might affect, Knauer could not immediately provide a number. She said the college has not recalled any students who are currently studying abroad. College officials are “discouraging College-affiliated travel to locations within the United States where states of emergency have been declared related to significant numbers of cases of COVID-19,” Knauer said in an email, referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Anyone who does travel to such locations, including California, Washington state and New York City, is also asked to self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to the campus. In addition, college officials have asked students who have traveled outside of a 100-mile radius from the campus to submit their plans to an online registry at https://mcdaniel.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9RKqqbRDKpOwxmd. Three Prince George’s County residents have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing Maryland’s total case count to eight people, state officials said Tuesday. There have been about 116,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,000 deaths globally. An email to members of the campus community states that “because this is a dynamic and ever-changing situation," college officials plan to issue an updated memorandum on March 19 with guidance for students, faculty and staff who are returning to the campus after spring break, which is scheduled to run from March 13 to March 22. Students are also not permitted to host “visitors who have been exposed to the virus, whose school is temporarily closed due to the virus, or who have recently traveled to one of the areas specified in the College’s Travel Restrictions,” according to the college’s online page for coronavirus updates. A coronavirus information session will be held for McDaniel students Tuesday, March 10, at 7:45 p.m. in Big Baker Chapel. The session will not be open to the public. McDaniel also runs a college in Budapest, Hungary — a country where fewer than 10 cases have been confirmed as of about 1 p.m. Tuesday — that has conducted “a deep disinfection cleaning” of the campus building and has asked several students who had not been feeling well to stay home for an extra week, according to that college’s website. Those students have been told to expect a daily email or phone call for an update on their health. McDaniel College Budapest has canceled a study tour of Prague and Vienna that was planned for April 3-7, and the college “strongly advises against travelling to countries considered at higher risk,” it posted on its website. Carroll County’s only other college has not announced any changes related to the coronavirus as of Tuesday. “Carroll Community College is working closely with the Carroll County Health Department [on] monitoring any new developments with the COVID-19 virus," spokeswoman Trish Carroll said in an email. "The College’s COVID-19 Response Team is meeting regularly to ensure the health and well-being of our students, employees and visitors. As conditions change in Carroll County, we are prepared to respond accordingly both operationally and instructionally.”

Six more Carroll County residents associated with long-term care facilities die of coronavirus
.W
As of April 22, six more people at Carroll County long-term care facilities have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to the Carroll County Health Department. According to data released late Wednesday afternoon, Carroll now has 365 cases of COVID-19, including the first of a child younger than 10. The cases total is up 26 from Tuesday. The county has now seen 44 deaths in total. Long-term care facilities have accounted for 229 of those cases and 40 of the deaths. Citing confidentiality, the Health Department is no longer releasing data about where the residents were living or how many facilities have had cases, or differentiating between residents and staff. Maggie Kunz, health planner with the Carroll County Health Department, said most of the facility cases of COVID-19 are older people with previously diagnosed health issues. “It seems that most of the facility cases are a lot of people that have underlying conditions already,” she said. She noted that the median age of all coronavirus cases in Carroll is 64. The median age, though, drops to 51 among community cases, that is, cases not associated with a long-term care facility. Of the 136 people who were confirmed with the virus not at a long-term care facility, 66 are women and 69 are men, with gender information for one more person unknown. One person is younger than 10 years old, two are in the 10-19 range; 24 are 20-29 years old, 14 are 30-39; 23 are 40-49; 46 are 50-59; 16 are 60-69; six are 70-79; and four are 80-89. Carroll County also reported Wednesday that it considers 62 people to be recovered from the disease, up by two since Tuesday. The Health Department tracks cases by ZIP code, and Westminster, with 161 total cases across two ZIP codes, has the most in Carroll, followed by Mount Airy with 107, Sykesville/Eldersburg with 49, Hampstead with 11, and Taneytown and Finksburg with eight each. Data is suppressed in ZIP codes with seven cases or fewer. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

‘It’s just beginning’: Maryland funeral homes say they lack guidance and gear as they brace for coronavirus surge
.W
Undertakers and crematory operators in Maryland say they lack sufficient guidance and equipment to keep employees and mourners safe while their workload spikes — with nearly 1,000 residents killed by the novel coronavirus and many more expected. One funeral director compared his peers to first responders in their ability to handle large numbers of bodies in instances of mass casualty. The funeral business is lower on the priority list for personal protective equipment — after hospitals and nursing homes — but firms point out that they can be exposed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, either through the dead or their families. Carlton Douglass, owner of Carlton C. Douglass Funeral Services in Baltimore, said the coronavirus pandemic reminds him of the AIDS outbreak in the 1980s, in which funeral directors treated each body as if it were a victim of the disease. “We have to assume the same thing right now: that every case is a possible COVID-19 case,” said Douglass, former president of the Maryland branch of the National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association. At Maryland Cremation Services in Millersville, the staff is seeing about a 30% increase in business, according to co-owners Sean and Dorota Marshall. Consultations with families are happening over the phone, and ashes are delivered to families at the curb. Transporters routinely pick up bodies from nursing homes, and the company’s two crematory machines are operating seven days a week. The staff is coming in earlier and staying longer to keep up with demand, they say. “It’s just exhausting,” Dorota Marshall said. Then there’s the lack of personal protective gear — such as masks, gloves and gowns. The Marshalls say they understand that hospitals and nursing homes should be the top priorities for protective equipment. But, they say, funeral industry workers are exposed not only to bodies but to the families and environments where patients lived. The U.S. Department of Labor and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that death care workers take precautions such as wearing protective equipment. COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and can also be passed through intermediary surfaces. Dr. Natasha Chida, assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said it’s unclear how long COVID-19 stays in the body after death. However, given the days that typically pass from death to an autopsy to ultimately landing at a funeral home or crematory, she said she believes the likelihood of transmission is low. “There’s always a theoretical risk, and that’s why we would recommend people to wear gloves ... not just goggles,” Chida said. “But I don’t think it’s a very likely route of transmission.” The Marshalls say they’ve gotten little information from the state about whether to handle COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 bodies differently. So they’re operating under the assumption they need protective gear and are constantly “scouring” the internet to find it. They were excited to get a shipment of 300 masks, only to find that the rubber fasteners snapped off as soon as they put them on. They’ve resorted to wearing masks for three to four days, which is beyond recommendations. They’re also running out of body bags. “We have about 100 bags left, and we can’t find any more,” Dorota Marshall said. Gov. Larry Hogan’s office did not respond to questions from The Baltimore Sun about its plans for handling a large number of bodies, should there be a surge in deaths. But some information has trickled out. Maryland had requested 15,000 body bags from the federal government’s stockpile but received none, according to federal documents. And about two weeks ago, Health Secretary Robert Neall publicly said the state was leasing two ice rinks to potentially store bodies, but Hogan walked that back hours later, saying “it’s just something that is being considered." Jack Mitchell, owner of Mitchell-Wiedefeld Funeral Home in Towson and treasurer for the National Funeral Director Association, said workers customarily wear protective gear when handling dead bodies and put masks on the deceased. While Mitchell’s funeral home hasn’t seen a drastic spike in bodies, “the cupboard has run bare” for equipment. About three weeks ago, Mitchell said, he sought to acquire personal protective equipment but found that it wasn’t clear how. After failing to submit an order through the Maryland Health Department and the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, Mitchell finally got confirmation of an order at the county level. While Mitchell waits for his shipment to arrive, he is searching through online vendors to find whatever equipment is remaining. “We do expect to receive some equipment, but we don’t know when it’s going to come,” Mitchell said. “So in the meantime, we’re kind of fending for ourselves just like everyone else.” Sean Naron, a spokesman for Baltimore County, wrote in an email that the Baltimore County Health Department is providing “general assistance to funeral homes.” “However, Baltimore County’s supply of PPE is limited,” Naron wrote, “and following [Maryland health department] guidance, the County is prioritizing requests to priority facilities, including long-term care facilities, emergency medical services, and inpatient hospital facilities.” Naron also said Baltimore County’s Emergency Operations Center is “coordinating with local hospitals to plan for potential surges and to help in planning for care of decedents.” Like Mitchell, Douglass’ funeral home hasn’t seen a drastic spike in business, but he sees the warning signs. “It’s just beginning,” he said.

Maryland releases about 200 juveniles from detention centers amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Maryland officials have released about 200 youths from state juvenile detention facilities over health concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic. The nearly one-third reduction of the state’s detained juvenile population was announced by Sam J. Abed, Maryland’s secretary of juvenile services, during a virtual meeting of the House of Delegates’ Judiciary Committee on Monday. Abed told the lawmakers the releases were in response to court rulings emphasizing the need to keep kids safe during the pandemic. He said the youths released were mostly held on nonviolent and misdemeanor charges. As a result, the percentage of juveniles detained on misdemeanor charges has dropped from 44% to 25% and the percentage of black youth detained has dropped from 77% to 58%, he added. Abed said five juveniles in state facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and all five have recovered. He said 11 staff members have been infected and three have recovered. “There’s virtually no one coming in through the arrest door,” the secretary added. A suit filed by public defenders helped cause the release. In response to the suit, Maryland’s top judge instructed lower-level courts to consider the implications of the pandemic on the health of youths when deciding whether to hold them in a detention center. “We’re glad they’ve seen the light, but they didn’t get here of their own accord,” Jenny Egan, chief attorney for the Juvenile Division of the public defender’s office in Baltimore, said of state officials. “Advocates have been calling for these changes for years.” Abed put the number of juveniles released through April 24 at 175. The public defender’s office provided data through April 27 that includes privately run facilities where Maryland youth are detained. According to those numbers, the state held 658 in juvenile facilities March 13. Today that number is 456, a reduction of 202. Del. Debra M. Davis, a Democrat from Charles County, noted that it was mostly black youths who were released after being held on minor charges. Davis added that she remained concerned the restrictions on new detainees entering the juvenile system would cause some youmg people to sit in adult prisons. “Black and brown people are disproportionately in the system,” Davis said. “They are still disproportionately being held.” As a result of the outbreak and fewer youths being held in Maryland facilities, the state has closed two juvenile detention centers: the Savage Mountain Youth Center in Garrett County and the J. DeWeese Carter Center in Kent County. Abed said the state also has stopped accepting new youth detainees at the Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, because of an outbreak of the virus there. Asked whether state policies about holding juveniles on misdemeanor offenses would change after the pandemic subsides, Abed said they would. “It would be a mistake to return to the practices of the past,” Abed told lawmakers. Egan said she was glad to hear that admission, but disappointed it took a health crisis to reform the juvenile justice system. “The crisis forced them to face the truth,” she said. “Let’s hope when the crisis abates, the realization that kids never belong in cages doesn’t go away as well.”

Laurel ice rink is serving as temporary morgue amid coronavirus pandemic, Maryland Gov. Hogan says
.W
The state of Maryland is using an ice rink in Laurel as a temporary morgue to handle a sharp increase in deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday. The Republican governor said he did not know how long the Gardens Ice House, a privately owned facility on Old Gunpowder Road, would be needed to store bodies. “Hopefully it won’t be for very long,” Hogan said in a news conference in Annapolis. "I was hoping we wouldn’t need it at all, but it is being utilized. I don’t know how long the lease is going to be needed.” A spokesman for the ice rink could not be reached for comment, and the Prince George’s County Health Department referred questions to state officials.

Howard County farms look to stay viable amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
A sure sign of spring in Howard County is the controlled chaos that unfolds at Clark’s Elioak Farm on Easter weekend. Bleating baby animals get their fill of being petted as more than 1,500 children are set loose at carefully choreographed intervals to gleefully scoop up colorful plastic eggs with baskets in hand. Not this year. The Ellicott City mainstay off Clarksville Pike normally opens its petting farm and Enchanted Forest attractions to the public April 1 and has opened earlier in years when Easter falls in March. With Gov. Larry Hogan’s ban on gatherings of more than 10 people and a stringent stay-at-home order issued March 30 in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the farm has postponed opening day until further notice. Egg hunts are far from the only pandemic-related losses for Howard County farms that have cultivated a dual identity as agricultural and agritourism operations. While farming is considered an essential business by the state government during the coronavirus outbreak, agritourism is not. With Maryland public schools closed through April 24 — and the looming possibility that closure may be extended — multiple Howard County farms are canceling field trips and postponing other group activities. During the pandemic, the emphasis on buying local may be more important than ever to farmers who are losing agritourism business as strict regulations are put in place, said Kathy Johnson, director of agricultural business development at the Howard County Economic Development Authority. Farms and farm stands are among the 11 food and agricultural sector businesses permitted to remain open in the governor’s amended emergency order. “You can shop with your eyes at a farmers market or on-farm store, and the farmer will bag [your selections] for you,” Johnson said. Six weekly farmers markets across the county are scheduled to begin opening May 6 on a staggered schedule, though current plans may have to be reevaluated to comply with government guidelines as that date draws nearer, she said. Opening dates for markets located in parking lots of county library branches remain tentative since the county library system is closed until further notice, Johnson said. These include sites at the Miller Branch in Ellicott City and the East Columbia Branch. Markets are also planned for Clarksville Commons, Maple Lawn, historic Ellicott City and Oakland Mills Village Center. A schedule with opening and closing dates will be updated as needed at hocofarms.com. Roadside stands, pick-your-own farms and farms selling produce, meats and dairy products are also listed on the website. “Just know that farmers are still doing their daily chores and raising food for you while taking all precautions” during the pandemic, Johnson said. Martha Clark and her daughter Nora Crist will continue to sell grass-fed beef and pastured pork at the Clark’s Elioak Farm Castle Store as they did throughout the winter. Fresh kale and cabbage grown in their high tunnel greenhouse are also for sale at the store, which is open Thursdays and Saturdays from noon to 3 p.m. and by appointment. More fresh produce will be added as the growing season progresses. The pair also have a few tricks up their sleeves to fill the gap for visitors until their farm can safely reopen and resume educational tours, birthday parties and other activities. Youth can view a gallery of farm animal photos online and watch videos of “Farmer Martha” as she does chores around the farm, such as painting the Three Bears’ House of Goldilocks fame. Links to these features are available on the farm’s Facebook, Instagram and Vimeo pages. Once the farm is allowed to reopen, Clark is weighing the possibility of selling timed tickets online that would allot visitors a specific two-hour slot and honor social distancing guidelines if they’re still required, she said. Tom Cunningham, owner of Mary’s Land Farm on Sheppard Lane in Ellicott City, said his farm has postponed educational activities, tours, cooking classes and other group events for an indefinite period, but his on-farm store remains open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day but Sunday. “Farmers look at producing food as a ministry,” Cunningham said, adding that this innate perspective can make the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic tough to accept. People should make an extra effort to eat healthy foods grown by local farmers to stay strong and avoid falling victim to the virus, he said. “Everyone should be watching their diets [more closely] during the pandemic, especially foods high in sodium or sugar,” he advised. While Cunningham is taking the new normal one day at a time, he said it’s in his nature to remain optimistic. “My hope is the sun blasts through the virus so people can come out” for activities at local farms, he said. The Roving Radish, an initiative of the Howard County Office on Community Sustainability since 2014, will once again sell seasonal meal kits, which are assembled from local farms’ poultry, meats and produce. The kits, which come in standard and vegetarian options, include ingredients and recipes to make two dinners for a family of four. They are available for $38 and to income-eligible consumers for the subsidized price of $18, said James Zoller, the county’s agricultural coordinator. “We’re anticipating we’ll have more clients” due to the pandemic, Zoller said, noting a seasonal subscription isn’t required and people can order week-to-week from online menus. “We served 300 kits last year, and we’re projecting sales of 420 kits this year.” Staff will take added precautions by establishing a 6-foot buffer between themselves and customers during pickup. “We will place the order on the counter and then step back and allow the client to pick it up,” he said, noting it requires more staff to carry out this protocol. With teleworking on the upswing and the stay-at-home order in place, Zoller is hopeful that family discussions on the importance of serving fresh foods and balanced nutritional meals might become more commonplace. “There’s the potential now that people will have more time to teach kids to cook,” he said. Lynn Moore, co-owner of Larriland Farm in Woodbine, said they’ve been “trying to come up with a way to open in May while keeping people 6 feet apart and as safe as we can.” With four fields of pick-your-own strawberries, there’s plenty of space to spread out on the farm, she said. Moore said the farm had already set up its long rows of strawberry plants on 3-foot centers and created 50-foot breaks in each row, since that’s the average length of plants one customer can pick. Staff plan to place customers in every other row to maintain social distancing guidelines. Peach trees, which workers are currently pruning, “are in full bloom and running three weeks early,” thanks to the mild winter, she said, adding that apple trees also seem to be ahead of schedule. “Access to fresh fruit and vegetables is so important that we feel an obligation to make this [social distancing system] work,” Moore said. Over the winter, Clark filled 1,700 goodie bags to hand out to kids on Easter weekend, and she is determined to distribute them. “We can still have egg hunts in the summer and have fun doing everything differently in 2020,” Clark said. “We are also exploring a series of after-hours adult events with wine and cheese and baby goats. We think everyone will need a respite from ‘cabin fever’ whenever we are able to get out and about again.”

Howard government announces plan with county hospital to manage possible surge of coronavirus patients
.W
Howard County General Hospital and Howard County government announced a surge plan Friday to handle the potential increased spread of the coronavirus, including repurposing spaces within the hospital to create isolated areas. The surge plan targets three goals, according to County Executive Calvin Ball: adding physical capacity to the hospital, tracking streamlining and purchasing vital equipment, and identifying and deploying staff to the hospital in Columbia. “It has been an enormous undertaking to engineer, convert and provide staffing for the spaces we need to treat COVID-19 patients at Howard County General Hospital, and it has been a true team effort to develop and execute these plans,” hospital President Steve Snelgrove said in a statement. Howard General previously had 255 beds with 16 intensive care beds. With the implementation of the surge plan, there are now 30 critical care beds with 40 total expected to be available by the end of the month. The hospital has 110 beds available for non-critical coronavirus patients. With the surge plan, Howard General can use tents set up outside the hospital’s main entrance to create 47 more beds for coronavirus patients. According to the county, Howard General has used 15% of available ventilators and no more than 20% of their capacity for coronavirus patients as of Friday. The county also announced that local hotels and facilities have been identified if needed for overflow. They did not specify the spaces or where they were. In a worst-case scenario, Howard County Office of Emergency Management officials said Howard Community College’s gym could be used. Earlier this week, Maryland officials reopened Laurel Medical Center in Prince George’s County — which was operating as an outpatient center — as part of the state’s preparations for a potential surge in infected patients.

Harford hospitals ready more beds anticipating a peak in coronavirus cases later this month
.W
Harford health officials said they have readied more beds in anticipation of a peak in coronavirus cases and taken other steps to protect against a surge. While several models make conflicting predictions of when the peak in cases will hit, the county could crest the wave between April 18 and the beginning of May, Harford County Health Officer Russell Moy said in an address to the Harford County Council Tuesday night. From speaking with medical professionals in areas like New Jersey and New York, that peak, Dr. Faheem Younus said, could fill 25% to 50% of all available hospital beds with COVID-19 patients. Working as the chief quality officer and chief of infectious diseases at University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, Younus said Harford’s hospitals had a head-start in addressing the coronavirus pandemic. The health system saw its first case of coronavirus a month ago, March 8, and began preparing for a wider number of cases early, opening lines of communication with county agencies and other medical services in the area. “Everybody is a partner under these circumstances,” Younus said. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air and Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace have increased the total number of available beds by “way over 100,” Younus said, as part of the hospitals’ surge plan for the “once-in-a-century event.” Capacity between the two hospitals is well over 300, Younus said. The surge plan is divided into eight levels, corresponding to severity of the spike in cases. Currently, UCH is on level two — a low surge — and treating 13 COVID patients across Upper Chesapeake and Harford Memorial. To protect its patients and personnel, UCH has restricted visitation and directed all staff to wear face masks. It has also halted elective surgeries. Since its first case, UCH began testing people referred by their doctors, and testing has become quicker. At the onset, supplies of personal protective equipment, or PPE, and COVID-19 tests were limited, but now the hospital has taken a number of precautions to improve its response to the pandemic. “We are much better prepared, our testing is much more robust,” Younus said. “If somebody came to our hospital today, we could have that test result within a day.” The hospitals have put tents in their parking lots, Younus said, and are considering alternate sites in case demand for care exceeds the hospital capacity, though he said it was too early to give specifics on those overflow sites. UCH is prepared to use all of its available space for patients, Younus said, including conference rooms, for instance. Moy said the situation is constantly changing, as is the understanding of the coronavirus and how to prevent it. Moy urged county residents to stay home except to pick up absolute necessities and to treat everybody like a potential carrier of the virus. Additionally, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that carriers can be infectious two days before symptoms manifest, he said, which changes the calculus for preventing transmission. It is far more infectious than originally thought. “Up to 25% of people with COVID-19 have no symptoms,” Moy said. “It has a big affect on how we address this pandemic.” Additionally, simply speaking is enough to transmit the virus, Moy said, as small droplets of infectious fluids can spray like mist and reach another person. The virus has also defied demographics, infecting young and old alike. UCH has an adequate number of ventilators — a shortage of which has caused national concern; Younus said fears of running out of them are over-hyped. Regrettably, most of the people on ventilators have less than a coin-flip’s chance of surviving — and some studies say chances of survival are less than 25%, he said. Many coronavirus patients that require ventilators are on them for a couple of weeks — significantly longer than the one to four days most regular patients need. “The outcomes are not very good,” he said of patients on ventilators. After a patient is cured of the virus, Younus said, they build up antibodies that can help stave off COVID-19 infection. It is unknown if that resistance is temporary or permanent, he said, and only time will tell. Some hospitals in China have had success transfusing plasma from recovered patients into critically ill patients on ventilators, he said. While not a panacea, the results have been promising as all the patients who received the plasma therapy showed improvement and were able to come off their ventilators. Younus likened the pandemic to seeing trees sprout leaves after the winter. And he forecasted a hard metaphorical winter ahead for Maryland, including significant social and economic losses. But those are secondary, he said, to public health, and will recover. "That is like losing the leaves. We will get them back,” he said. “Losing human beings is like losing trees.” As of Wednesday morning, there were 86 confirmed coronavirus cases in Harford County, according to state data, representing a one-day increase of 45% from the number of cases reported Tuesday. No COVID-19 related deaths have been reported in Harford thus far. Statewide, confirmed cases increased by over 1,000 Wednesday — representing the largest single-day spike since the first cases were reported in Maryland. Among the 5,529 confirmed cases, 124 Marylanders have died from the respiratory virus.

Harford’s coronavirus numbers continue to climb as virus spreads to more communities
.W
Half of Harford County’s ZIP codes now have eight or more confirmed coronavirus cases, including the communities of Havre de Grace, Fallston and Street, according to the latest data released Monday from the Maryland Department of Health. Total confirmed cases in the county reached 226 on Monday, a jump of 50 since Friday morning, when County Executive Barry Glassman and the local health department announced the first confirmed COVID-19 related death in Harford. The 27-year-old male had underlying health conditions, Glassman said Friday. The Harford County Health Department later confirmed he was one of the six “probable” deaths reported by the state earlier in the week. "We are saddened to hear of this news and our thoughts go out to the family of this young man," Harford County Health Officer Dr. Russell Moy said in a prepared statement. "In this time of great uncertainty, we worry about all those who have fallen ill and those who we know are vulnerable. Please stay home to protect everyone in Harford County.” As of 10 a.m. Monday, it continued to be the only confirmed coronavirus death in Harford, with five others considered probable, meaning COVID-19 was listed on a person’s death certificate, but it had not yet been confirmed by laboratory testing. ZIP codes in the central part of the county continue to make up the majority of confirmed cases in Harford. Bel Air’s two ZIP codes, along with Edgewood, Forest Hill and Abingdon, account for 150 cases, roughly two-thirds of the total confirmed cases in the county. Harford County confirmed cases by ZIP Code Data is as of 10 a.m. April 20 21040 (Edgewood) – 42 21014 (Bel Air North) - 32 21015 (Bel Air South) - 29 21050 (Forest Hill) – 25 21009 (Abingdon) - 22 21085 (Joppa) - 17 21001 (Aberdeen) – 12 21078 (Havre de Grace) – 10 21047 (Fallston) - 9 21154 (Street) - 8 21087 (Kingsville) – 8 21005 (APG North) - 7 or fewer 21010 (APG South) - 7 or fewer 21013 (Baldwin) - 7 or fewer 21017 (Belcamp) - 7 or fewer 21028 (Churchville) - 7 or fewer 21034 (Darlington) - 7 or fewer 21084 (Jarrettsville) - 7 or fewer 21111 (Monkton) – 7 or fewer 21132 (Pylesville) - 7 or fewer 21160 (Whiteford) - 7 or fewer 21161 (White Hall) - 7 or fewer Note: The Maryland Department of Health is suppressing data for ZIP codes with seven or fewer confirmed cases for privacy purposes.

Baltimore officials are planning a targeted ad campaign to reach the city’s black residents in hopes of combating rumors that black people cannot get the new coronavirus, the city’s health commissioner announced Tuesday. During a news conference at City Hall, Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa said Baltimore officials are concerned about “persistent” rumors that the coronavirus is not impacting the city’s black population when the reverse is true. She said black residents account for more of Maryland’s confirmed cases than other populations, and African Americans have a higher mortality rate from the disease. According to the latest data from the state health department, 49% of the cases where race is known are among black residents, compared with 35% for whites, while the state’s overall population is about 30% black. African Americans account for just more than half of the deaths where race is known. In response, Baltimore plans to post “culturally relevant signage” — beyond social media and traditional advertising — in locations around the city where officials believe some black residents are gathering, despite a statewide stay-at-home order, Dzirasa said. Locations for the signs will include bus stops, corner stores and other “hot spots.” As of Tuesday, there were 962 reported cases of COVID-19 in Baltimore and 29 deaths as a result, according to Maryland Department of Health data. The virus has killed 302 people statewide and sickened more than 9,400. Dzirasa also said Tuesday that city officials continue to look for locations to open temporary coronavirus testing sites in the city. Locations in the city’s east and west sides are under consideration because that’s where some of the highest number of cases have been reported thus far, she said. “Our goal will be to ensure that all residents, especially those without access to a car, can receive testing in their local community,” she said. Over the weekend, state officials began releasing data on the pandemic by ZIP code, making it easier to see what areas have been hardest hit. Last week, Baltimore’s first drive-thru site opened at Pimlico Race Course in the Nothwest Baltimore’s 21215 ZIP code, the hardest hit ZIP code in the city. Four out of five of that area’s residents are black. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young initially said the Pimlico site would be able to run 50 tests per day, but the center has nearly doubled that. Tests were conducted on 96 people Friday, and another 115 were scheduled for Tuesday, Dzirasa said. The site was closed Monday due to bad weather. Young also said Tuesday that he is considering a policy requiring people to cover their faces in the city when in public to help combat the spread of the virus. Young cautioned that not every city resident will be able to afford a mask, nor can the city provide them. “What we’re looking at is to get a policy that would say ‘face covering while you’re in public,’” he said, noting an announcement may come Friday on such a policy. Additionally, Young said he has been in contact with the Maryland Transit Administration to discuss limiting the number of people on city buses. As the service has limited its routes, an unhealthy number of people have been riding buses together, he said. “We don’t want people all crammed up on the bus, elbow to elbow,” he said.

‘It went like wildfire’: How national testing shortage helped lead to Maryland’s deadliest coronavirus cluster
.W
Before the coronavirus had reached the Pleasant View Nursing Home in the small Maryland town of Mount Airy, the home’s administrator asked the state health department what she should be doing about the threat. Some of Rebecca Travels’ staff worked second jobs at other nursing homes, she said, and she wanted to hedge against an outbreak. Nursing care facilities in other states had been hit hard, and she feared for her older residents — who live four to a room. At first, state officials told her that her facility didn’t qualify for testing under the stringent criteria set out by the federal government amid a nationwide shortage of testing kits, she said. Later, after the first case of the virus had been confirmed within her facility March 26, she said state officials told her using tests on staff would be a “waste of resources,” and that staff with symptoms should just self-isolate. A week later, six of her 95 residents were dead, and three more deaths were announced Saturday. Dozens of other residents have tested positive for the virus. And according to Gov. Larry Hogan, it was an employee without symptoms — not one Travels would have known to isolate without a test — who likely brought the virus in. “It’s a tragic situation, one of the most difficult things we’ve been dealing with," Hogan said in a C-SPAN interview Tuesday in which he drew comparisons to other major nursing home outbreaks in Washington, Georgia, Tennessee and Minnesota. “It went like wildfire.” Said Travels: “It’s just incredibly frustrating. There’s a failing of support from federal resources." State officials would not answer questions related to their response at Pleasant View specifically or in nursing homes generally, nor would they discuss other aspects of their coronavirus response capabilities. Hogan’s office did not respond to questions about his statements on how the virus arrived at Pleasant View. But by Friday, he and other state officials were acknowledging a much larger problem: Pleasant View was one of 60 nursing homes across the state where the virus had been detected, Hogan said, with other facilities seeing clusters of up to 10 cases. Public health experts agreed that a lack of federal support to the state on a range of measures had contributed. In nursing homes with vulnerable residents, close quarters and staff who work in multiple facilities, the virus is cutting a particularly deadly path. Nurses and other staff who carry heavy workloads and work multiple jobs are helping to speed up the spread. And the nation’s lack of testing, coupled with its inability to effectively trace the contacts of those who are infected, has left local and state health departments blind in the battle to intervene. “The general principle is that we have to be making testing available as part of an infection control strategy,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, former Maryland health secretary and now vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “The lack of testing is hindering the development of an effective response strategy, both for nursing homes and for the general public,” Sharfstein said. That is particularly true given the danger of asymptomatic contagion. Scientists have been closely studying the degree to which the virus can be spread by people who haven’t yet developed symptoms, or in some cases never get ill, and have raised some concern that common screening practices don’t accurately reflect that risk. Those people could make up a quarter of all coronavirus cases, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview with NPR Tuesday. Research in countries where testing has been more widespread, on a per capita basis, suggests asymptomatic cases are a much bigger risk than that. One study in China found that 86% of cases across hundreds of cities went undetected in January because people had mild, limited or no symptoms. China on Wednesday began reporting more than 1,500 lab-confirmed yet asymptomatic cases, spurring concerns of a new wave of infections as the country prepares to end lockdowns. In Maryland, and in local jurisdictions all across the United States, the fear is that asymptomatic people, including nursing home staff, are carrying and spreading the virus. And without adequate testing and tracing, officials don’t know who they are, where they’ve been, who they’ve been in contact with or how to isolate them to reduce the spread. Front-line hospital workers have had better access to testing. But they, too, face pressures to remain at work, especially if asymptomatic, given the intense demand for care. Nursing homes are particularly susceptible to the associated risk, as they are full of vulnerable patients with underlying health conditions, who live in close quarters and are treated by the same nurses. In addition to Pleasant View, coronavirus infections have been identified in recent weeks in nursing homes in Baltimore and in Baltimore and Howard counties, while a Montgomery County facility began isolating residents after an infected person attended an event there. On Wednesday, officials announced several new clusters in nursing homes across the region, including four cases at another facility in Carroll County: the Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster. It was not immediately clear which of the facilities, if any, shared staff. On Thursday, county officials said a total of 18 Pleasant View staffers had tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, that number increased to 24. Noting the spread to 60 homes statewide, Frances Phillips, the state’s deputy secretary for public health services, said there was now “clear evidence” the spread was being aided by asymptomatic staffers. Phillips has issued a mandate requiring all nursing home staff to begin wearing masks, and said state testing capacity is now being set aside to focus on tests from nursing homes, to expedite the process. Some experts said moves to protect nursing home populations were overdue. “When you’re talking about nursing homes, you’re talking about some of the most vulnerable populations,” said Trudy Henson, public health program director at the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland School of Law, who has worked with nursing homes to enhance their emergency planning. Sharfstein said he could not speak directly to the Pleasant View case, but that generally in such settings, “you have the risk of not just one person being infected, but many people being infected" if a virus isn’t stopped in its tracks early. Testing in such settings should be a top priority for states and local health departments, he said, because “if testing identifies a case, it’s very important to respond quickly with infection control." Similarly, contact tracing — or tracking an infected individual’s path through society to identify contacts across an array of interactions — is critically important once a case is identified, in part because staff members work in multiple facilities, he and others said. Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Bloomberg School’s Center for Health Security, said large clusters will continue occurring in nursing homes and elsewhere in the United States without massive improvements in both testing and tracing. “We need a national-level vision for how we can get to that point, identifying every single case and tracing all of their contacts, and we’re going to need a big push from state and local health departments to get there,” Watson said. “We should be aiming to be able to test every contact of every case.” Contact tracing is extremely labor-intensive. It can involve using infected people’s recollections, contacts, social media and bank transactions to retrace their steps back through their neighborhoods and workplaces, at restaurants and on public transit, reaching out to everyone they may have come in contact with. Robust testing would, in theory, help reduce the number of people for whom tracing would be required, as it would allow authorities to intervene, and request isolation and quarantines, sooner. In some Asian countries like South Korea, which instituted widespread testing and tracing quickly, society has been left more open because authorities there are confident that, if and when a new case arises, they can contain it. President Donald Trump claimed last week that the United States is doing a good job responding to the pandemic, testing a million people. But governors, other local officials and public health experts reject that notion. In his C-SPAN interview, Hogan dismissed a claim by Trump that the United States is doing a good job testing people. “No, it’s not fixed by any stretch of the imagination," he said of the testing problem. “We can’t produce these things fast enough and get them out fast enough. While we’ve made dramatic improvements in the past few weeks, we have not done enough testing. It’s a big part of the problem. We’re making improvements. It’s just not fast enough.” Establishing faster testing and sufficient tracing to tackle each case or cluster quickly would be one way out of the current stay-at-home orders that many states have implemented. Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security, said social-distancing measures that have hobbled the American economy and sent unemployment skyrocketing could be lifted once “the disease is driven to such a low prevalence that our health departments could again do contact tracing and isolation.” But "that’s not happening” in a robust way at the moment, he said. It is unclear exactly how much contact tracing the state and local health departments are doing, or how they have responded to the Pleasant View outbreak in particular, in part because they won’t answer questions about either. They won’t discuss the decisions not to provide tests to the facility early on, why they at one point provided 27 test kits to Travels only to take them back, or about whether and how they are attempting to trace the contacts of those affiliated with known cases — including Pleasant View staff who also work at other facilities. Pleasant View is regulated by state and federal agencies. It has received some poor marks in the past — labeled as “much below average” overall compared with other facilities. Its rating on staffing was much below average, while its health inspection and quality of resident care ratings were both below average. But it had not received any serious penalties in the three years before its most recent federal review. Carroll County Health Officer Ed Singer said last week that the facility had been following proper guidelines before the outbreak. “To the best of our knowledge, the facility was doing everything they were supposed to be doing,” Singer said. Travels said she implemented visitor restrictions March 10, screening visitors and health care workers for symptoms. On March 11, Travels called a staff meeting to reiterate the importance of following infection-control protocol. By March 13, Pleasant View received guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to discontinue communal dining and activities. Travels said she and her assistant were at the facility by 6 the next morning to implement those changes. “We followed every recommendation to the letter from the minute that it came out,” Travels said. After she learned of the first confirmed case March 26, Travels said, she again followed federal guidelines, asking her 120 to 130 staff members to inform her of any other jobs they held in facilities where residents could also be at risk. She recommended they inform their other employers that they had contact with a positive case. And she said she trusted her staff did that, but had no way of knowing for certain. State officials would not say whether they have stepped in to ensure those notifications have been made. They have not publicly identified other nursing homes where Pleasant View staffers work. They have not said how many Pleasant View staff members are being isolated, or are ill, or have been tested — though they finally began arranging testing for staff this past week, county health officials said. Many residents have been moved out of Pleasant View, either into hospitals or to other facilities. Hogan said Friday 42 residents and staff had been sent to 14 different hospitals. Leaders of nursing home industry groups say they have for weeks been urging facilities to determine whether any of their staff also work in facilities where coronavirus cases have been confirmed. The groups have stressed that those employees must be barred from coming to work for at least two weeks, said Joe DeMattos, executive director of the Health Facilities Association of Maryland. But he said that responsibility is resting on the industry, and that state and local health officials are not enforcing it. Nursing homes are “all scouring their employee lists,” said Kevin Heffner, president of LifeSpan Network, a group representing nursing homes across Maryland. “They’re doing everything to the nth degree to make sure they protect their staff and their residents.” Industry groups, including LifeSpan, the Health Facilities Association of Maryland and Leading Age Maryland, have been surveying member companies and facilities and coordinating with the state’s Office of Health Care Quality to ensure nursing homes have enough protective equipment for staff, space to isolate patients and backup staff in the event that employees have to be quarantined, Heffner said. And many, but not all, nursing homes are using medical screening equipment that can help quickly rule out the flu or colds when respiratory illnesses appear, as well as data tracking to detect hot spots of people showing mild symptoms, he said. “We’re trying to get ahead of things so when the next wave comes, or when things peak, they’re prepared to be able to shift resources around so we’re meeting the need immediately,” Heffner said. “As opposed to, ‘Uh-oh, what do we do now?’ ” Baltimore Sun reporter Lillian Reed contributed to this article.

University of Maryland partnering with Facebook to help collect coronavirus data for research efforts
.W
Faculty at the University of Maryland have been working with Facebook to design a worldwide survey aimed at collecting coronavirus data during the global pandemic. The University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University are partnering with the social media company to gather information on the coronavirus to help diagnose which areas have been most impacted and assist public health officials in their response and prevention efforts. Frauke Kreuter, director of the Joint Program in Survey Methodology at UMD, said Thursday in a phone interview that faculty in four departments — survey methodology, geography, computer science and information science — have been working since late March to help develop an approximately five-minute survey that Facebook can distribute to its over 2 billion active monthly users. The first part of the survey focuses on what symptoms people have exhibited, while the second and third parts center on social distancing behavior and demographic information. Survey responses are recorded on an off-site platform, then sent back to researchers and not shared with Facebook. Initial findings from Carnegie Mellon have been used to plot geographic data relating to COVID-19, such as doctors’ visits in a specific region and demand for flu tests. Kreuter said the departments have worked “day and night” in the recent weeks to quickly create a survey to collect data on the coronavirus, which has over 3 million confirmed cases worldwide, and over 1 million confirmed cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University. “As the world fights covid-19 and countries develop plans to reopen their societies, it’s critical to have a clear understanding of how the disease is spreading,” Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote in The Washington Post. “Better data can help governments determine where to send resources such as ventilators and personal protective equipment — and eventually which areas are safe to start opening up again.”

Consumer rights group urges Hogan to implement protections for coronavirus stimulus checks 
.W
A letter from nonprofit Maryland Consumer Rights Coalition, which was co-signed by 30 other labor organizations and other groups, was sent to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera on Tuesday asking for protection from garnishments on stimulus checks doled out by the federal government during the coronavirus pandemic. The $2 trillion aid package was signed into law late March by President Donald Trump to provide relief to families and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many workers have reported cases of debt collectors swooping in to take their checks. A representative from the governor’s office could not be immediately reached for comment. The letter to Hogan urges him to act by “clarifying that all stimulus checks are exempt from garnishment and that garnishment of such funds is an unfair and deceptive trade practice.” The groups also asked Hogan to keep in place “the enforcement of all new and existing garnishment orders as well as offsets against benefits or tax returns; seizure of property; or liens.” State governments across the country have enacted measures to keep the money in the hands of workers and families. In Washington, D.C., an emergency order bars creditors and debt collectors from acting on the garnishment of wages, earnings, or property for payments until July 9. The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that garnishments will not be issued through April 26. Marceline White, executive director of the Maryland Consumer Rights Coalition, said the impetus of the letter came after she heard of various workers who had deposited their stimulus checks in their bank accounts, only to check later and find out they had been taken by creditors and debt collectors. White said Hogan has been proactive throughout the coronavirus pandemic in protecting workers and is hopeful he will act soon. “This money is not to pay back rent, it’s not to pay a credit card debt, it’s not to pay off something else,” White said. “This is for immediate needs and to immediately help people today during this very critical period in our country.” Almost 62,000 Marylanders filed for unemployment last week and nearly 297,000 people have filed for unemployment in the past month.

Rate of coronavirus hospitalizations, intensive cases flat in Maryland, deaths increase 3%
.W
The rate of coronavirus hospitalizations in Maryland and the rate of intensive care admissions — the two statistics state officials are tracking most closely as they consider when to begin reopening the state — were both roughly flat again Monday. But the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage Maryland, and the number of deaths increased by 34 from the day before, to a total of 1,216 across the state, according to the health department. State officials believe another 101 deaths were probably caused by the coronavirus, but those cases were not confirmed by testing. Expanded testing in Maryland is resulting in increases in the number of confirmed cases and the number of negative test results. The state reported 946 new confirmed cases Monday, bringing Maryland’s total to 26,408, while the number of negative tests increased by 3,255, officials said. The state plans to open a new drive-thru testing location at the Hagerstown vehicle-emissions testing station, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday. The number of those currently hospitalized increased by 14 people to 1,649, and the number of intensive care cases dropped by two patients from the day before, according to the state. The number of patients in acute care dropped nearly 3% to 1,086, officials said. A total of 1,695 patients have been released from isolation. African Americans accounted for more than a third of the state’s cases, followed by Caucasians at 22%, Hispanics (18%), Asians (2%), unknown (19%) and other (4%), according to state data. The five ZIP codes with the highest numbers of cases — 20783, 20906, 20706, 20902 and 20904 — are in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. Two ZIP codes in the Baltimore area — 21215 and 21228 — were in the top 10 in the state, with 404 and 331 cases, respectively, officials said. People older than 65 and those with preexisting conditions and compromised immune systems are considered the most high-risk for dying from COVID-19, according to medical experts. While patients ages 20 to 59 accounted for nearly 65% of cases, two-thirds of the Marylanders confirmed to have died from the pandemic were older than 70, according to state data. Nursing home residents represented nearly half of the state’s total cases, and nursing home staff accounted for an additional 6%, according to the state.

Columbia, Ellicott City and Mount Airy are coronavirus hot spots in Howard County, state data shows
.W
Most of the 403 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Howard County are congregated in two parts of the county — the Columbia/Ellicott City area and Mount Airy — according to ZIP code data released by the Maryland Department of Health this week. Howard County announced late Tuesday it would also release data by ZIP code and age on its coronavirus dashboard. The county’s data is listed by case rate per 10,000 people. Many of 106 cases in 21771, a Mount Airy ZIP code, which stretches across Howard, Carroll, Frederick and Montgomery counties, can be traced to the Pleasant View Nursing Home. At the facility, 81 residents and 36 staff members as of Tuesday have tested positive. Twenty-four residents have died from the coronavirus, officials said. In the eastern part of Howard County, there’s a hot spot in the Columbia/Ellicott City area. In Columbia, the 21044, 21045 and 21046 ZIP codes have a combined 143 positive cases as of Tuesday. The 21042 and 21043 ZIP codes of Ellicott City have 79 positive cases total. The 21043 ZIP code also crosses into Baltimore County. There have been nine coronavirus deaths in the county since the first positive case was announced March 15. The state coronavirus website does not specify which ZIP codes deaths occur in. Across Maryland, there have been 9,472 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Tuesday, including 302 deaths, according to state Department of Health data. The Howard County confirmed cases by ZIP code are: 20701 (Annapolis Junction, includes Howard and Anne Arundel counties) — fewer than 7  20723 (Laurel) — 64  20759 (Fulton) — fewer than 7  20763 (Savage) — fewer than 7  20777 (Highland, includes Howard and Montgomery counties) — fewer than 7  20794 (Jessup, includes Howard and Anne Arundel counties) — 46  20833 (Brookeville, includes Howard and Montgomery counties) — 8  21029 (Clarksville) — 11  21036 (Dayton) — fewer than 7  21042 (Ellicott City) — 28  21043 (Ellicott City, includes Howard and Baltimore counties) — 51  21044 (Columbia) — 59  21045 (Columbia) — 64  21046 (Columbia) — 20  21075 (Elkridge) — 52  21076 (Hanover, includes Howard and Anne Arundel counties) — 39  21104 (Marriottsville, includes Howard, Baltimore and Carroll counties) — 9  21163 (Woodstock, includes Howard and Baltimore counties) — fewer than 7  21723 (Cooksville) — fewer than 7  21737 (Glenelg) — fewer than 7  21738 (Glenwood) — fewer than 7  21771 (Mount Airy, includes Howard, Carroll, Frederick and Montgomery counties) — 106  21784 (Sykesville, includes Howard and Carroll counties) — 29  21794 (West Friendship) — fewer than 7  21797 (Woodbine, includes Howard and Carroll counties) — 14 ZIP codes with fewer than seven cases do not have exact data reported on the state website.

Bird Brown: Sports giving us some hope during coronavirus threat
.W
My family were huge University of Maryland sports fans when I was growing up. My mother is a graduate (Class of 1965), and when we moved back in to the area my father purchased season tickets to football and basketball games. I grew up cheering on the likes of Brad Davis, John Lucas, Mo Howard, Tom McMillen, and Len Elmore, and even supported Tom Roy through his awkward stages. I loved Lefty Driesell and his emotional coaching style getting the attention of the referees or his players with him signature stamping of his left foot. I’ve always been a Notre Dame football fan but enjoyed going to watch some of the Terps teams in the 1970s with Randy White and Bob Avellini. I even followed them into the 80s with Boomer Esiason and Frank Reich. I even met my wife at Memorial Stadium during a Maryland-Clemson football game in 1986. Even though Maryland left the Atlantic Coast Conference and joined the Big Ten (or 16, or whatever), I still follow the basketball team. But somehow games against Ohio State and Michigan don’t carry the same weight or excitement as a good, old-fashioned Maryland-North Carolina or Maryland-Duke game. I used to love to hate Carolina. And Duke? Don’t even get me started. That’s why it’s baffled me for a few years now that my own mother, a Maryland graduate, no longer roots for her beloved Terps but sports the ugly blue and white of the dreaded Blue Devils. Where did it all go wrong? It goes all the way back to the handling of the Len Bias situation and the firing of Driesell, but even more so that the rise of Coach K at Duke was happening about the same time. She’s been a staunch Blue Devils supporter ever since. Although I respect Coach K and the many great players that they’ve had come through there, as well as their tremendous success on the court, there are few teams for which I would root for Duke over them. All last year, I heard from my mother was how good the team was. I wasn’t impressed. Then I started to watch more of the NBA games with my boys this year and anxiously awaited the debut of the next best thing, Zion Williamson. With skepticism I sat with an adult beverage in hand and watched as Zion introduced himself to the league with 22 points on 8-for-11 shooting in just more than 18 minutes of play, but even more impressive was his 4-for-4 night from beyond the 3-point line. He got my attention. I watched most every one of his games after that until the NBA shut its doors because of the coronavirus. I kept telling myself that it was OK to watch him because although he played for Duke, he was a Pelican now. But here’s where the kid become my new favorite player. Just as the country was waking up to the seriousness of this virus with professional sports leagues shutting down or postponing their seasons, people began to realize the real impact it was going to have on the ancillary businesses that provided necessary support services to the teams and players. Facing an uncertain future as congress continued with its partisan shenanigans, and before many of the state and local governments had yet to restrict people’s movement to work, the workers at the arenas of these professional sports leagues were out of work for an undetermined time. Before many athletes or sports organizations got involved to help their staffs (and there are many) through these times, here’s this 19-year-old kid from North Carolina, adopted by his new hometown of New Orleans pledging to pay the salaries of the entire Smoothie King Arena staff for 30 days, the original length of the NBA’s schedule delay. I know that he makes a lot of money, but the fact that he was one of the first players in the NBA — heck, in professional sports — to offer to pay the salaries or offer financial assistance to people affected by this economic shutdown just tells you a lot about the time of person Zion Williamson really is and he should be applauded for that. But he’s not alone. Cleveland Cavaliers star Kevin Love donated $100,000 to the Rocket Mortgage Field House workers. First, Giannis Antetokounmpo, then the entire Milwaukee Bucks team, chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to help their staff. Even Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban pledged to support his arena’s staff as did many other owners in the NBA. It’s not just basketball. Players and owners from every professional league, all providing financial pledges or setting up fundraising opportunities through which people could participate. And then there’s plenty of stories like Dallas Cowboys player DeMarcus Lawrence who, with teammates Daniel Ross and Jaylon Smith, worked with food trucks serving meals to first responders. And there’s plenty of this going on in our neighborhoods with free meals being served, neighbors helping neighbors, and kindness spreading quicker than the virus. As Saint Teresa of Calcutta once said, “Never worry about numbers. Help one person at a time and always start with the person nearest you.” All you can do is to do what we can.

Maryland’s confirmed coronavirus cases increase by 854, halting two days of decreasing figures
.W
Maryland officials said Monday the state has confirmed 854 cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours, ending a brief downward trend in the number of new daily cases. Kata Hall, spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan, wrote on Twitter that the state now has at least 13,684 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since Sunday. The state is also reporting 34 more people have died or probably died due to the disease since Saturday, bringing the death count up to 582 people. Prince George’s and Montgomery counties continue to lead the state in coronavirus cases, with 3,583 and 2,647 cases, respectively. Of the zip codes with the highest coronavirus cases count, nine of the top 10 are within either Montgomery or Prince George’s counties. Silver Spring in Montgomery County continues to be a hot spot for the disease, as three zip codes associated with the city — 20906, 20904 and 20902 — all have more than 200 cases and are in the top 10 in the state for confirmed coronavirus cases. Total, they account for 662 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state. The largest count of coronavirus cases per zip code is 269 in 21215, which includes part of Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Hall wrote. The region includes the FutureCare Lochearn facility, a nursing home in the city where at least 170 people — 129 residents and 41 staffers — have tested positive for COVID-19. The distribution of new cases and deaths also continues to disproportionately affect the state’s black population, who continue to be the leading demographic for COVID-19 cases in the state. As of Monday, 5,064 black people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, compared to 3,156 white people, despite the fact that whites are the majority population in the state. Although racial data is not currently available for 2,917 patients. As many as 224 black people have either died or probably died due to the coronavirus, about 44% of deaths for cases where racial demographic data was available. The state has yet to identify the race of 75 confirmed or probably victims of the disease. The uptick in the number of cases come as pressure to reopen businesses and lift social distancing restrictions has grown in recent days. Protesters clogged the streets of Annapolis Sunday to march against the executive orders signed by Gov. Hogan. Mike Ricci, spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan, wrote on Twitter that police have responded to 1,836 calls for service for potential violations of the governor’s executive orders that closed businesses statewide and restricted crowd size. As of Monday, 45 people have been charged with violations, Ricci wrote.

Howard County Chinese community coming together to provide resources during coronavirus pandemic
.W
When the coronavirus outbreak hit the state of Maryland, the Chinese community in Howard County quickly came together, organizing monetary drives to purchase meals and medical supplies for county medical professionals and first responders. The Howard County Chinese School in Columbia, the Chinese American Parent Association of Howard County, the Peiying Chinese School in Clarksville, the Howard County Chinese American Doctor Association and the Johns Hopkins University Chinese Student Scholar Association have taken part in organizing drives. Some residents within Howard’s Chinese community “have family members in China who just experienced the coronavirus emergency. We know how serious it can be,” said Chao Wu, a Clarksville resident and Board of Education member. “So when we began to hear some cases in Maryland, we know it could be serious,” Wu said, who had visited family in Wuhan City in China in January. He self-quarantined when he returned home. The new coronavirus was first detected in December in Wuhan City, an industrial and transportation hub in central China. There are three active GoFundMe fundraisers being run by the Howard County Chinese School and the Chinese American Parent Association. In total, the three funds had raised more than $47,000 as of Wednesday morning. Fundraising for Local Hospital Staff: gofundme.com/f/fundraising-for-local-hospital-staff  Support the First Responders in Howard County: gofundme.com/f/support-the-first-responders-in-howard-county  Howard County Fights COVID-19: gofundme.com/f/howard-county-chinese-community-fight-covid19 Donations to one of the GoFundMe pages will provide meals from restaurants to Howard County General Hospital staff, and the other two are focused on providing personal protective equipment to local medical professionals, law enforcement and first respsonders. The Chinese American Parent Association is running two of the GoFundMe fundraisers, said President Jean Xu. The association has provided two days of meals, 350 meals a day, to Howard County General Hospital. The meals were purchased from local restaurants Yama Sushi in Ellicott City and Main Stage Grille in Woodstock. By doing so, the association can “support the local restaurants at the same time we purchase meals to show our appreciation to the [Howard County] General Hospital staff,” Xu said. “We know those staff are working the front lines for us. They are taking care of us, and we want to show our appreciation and we want them to feel beloved because they are really fighting for us,” Xu said. The association also has donated 9,000 latex gloves and four 1-gallon jugs of hand sanitizer to the Howard County Police Department. Dr. Jiayan Chen, a Clarksville resident and an internal medicine doctor at the Baltimore Washington Medical Center in Anne Arundel County, is working directly with confirmed coronavirus patients and those who are suspected to have the virus. Chen said she is appreciative of her community to come together, donating supplies and funds to help medical professionals and first responders stay safe. “I am so touched; it’s been very touching. We’re not fighting this alone. We have a whole community of people supporting us and are so loving,” Chen said. “We will definitely defeat this virus. The community is giving us a lot of strength.” Chen’s church, Columbia Chinese Baptist Church in Ellicott City, contacted her and donated 380 N95 face masks and nearly 1,100 surgical masks to Baltimore Washington Medical Center. “[On Monday], I received 20 face shields made by [Howard County] middle and high school students,” Chen said. The students made around 200 face shields, following a model from Johns Hopkins University, Chen said. The rest of them went to Howard County General Hospital. From reading the news about the coronavirus spreading in China and because many Howard residents have family in China, Chen said she and other residents have had a little more sense of how the virus was working before the United States outbreak. “As a Chinese population, we feel it is our responsibility to help doctors and family members fight against this virus,” Chen said. “We want everyone to be well.”

18-year-old Taneytown resident treating coronavirus patients, learning on the job at Carroll Hospital
.W
Caroline Bowen applied in late January for a patient care tech position at Carroll Hospital in an effort to gain some valuable experience in her pursuit of a nursing career. Bowen, a senior at Mount Airy Christian Academy, spent some time during her junior year as a sonographer at Maryland Perinatal Associates, a pregnancy care center, in Frederick. Last fall she worked as an intern at Westminster Surgery Center. Bowen was also doing administrative work in a doctor’s office, but said she wanted more preparation before graduating and heading into Stevenson University’s nursing program. Carroll Hospital had a spot for her, and Bowen started working there part-time in early March. A few weeks later, she found herself with unprecedented experience. The 18-year-old Taneytown resident joined hospital staff as coronavirus cases started piling up. Her days start at 3 p.m. and go until 11, and Bowen said she spends her time working with a nurse and tending to patients’ needs. “Most people, they’ve been working at the hospital for years. This is a crazy change for them,” Bowen said. “I’ve just started working there, so it’s kind of all I’ve really known.” Bowen worked last fall to become a certified nursing assistant and a geriatric nursing assistant, according to a news release from Mount Airy Christian Academy, so she could get financial aid toward her college degree. These days, Bowen is focused on doing what she can at the hospital while Maryland’s coronavirus numbers continue to rise. Carroll County has seen more than 300 cases with at least 35 deaths, according to the Carroll County Health Department. “When corona hit I told her I wanted her to quit,” Stephenie Bowen, Caroline’s mother, said via text message. “I prayed about it and God put me at peace. ... Caroline feels called to be there, and who am I to argue with that?” Bowen said she’s nearing the end of her training period at the hospital. The first few days she was able to shadow a veteran employee, but Bowen said now she’s usually on her own working on one of the hospital floors. Sometimes she cares for patients with the coronavirus, Bowen said, and other times she’s helping those who don’t have those symptoms. “The nurses basically delegate the work that we are able to do,” Bowen said. “It depends on what patients are in the unit. We’ll have to go in and get vital signs. I’ll gown up and I’ll go into the coronavirus patient’s room and I’ll get their vitals, and if they need some water I’ll go and give them their cup of water.” Vicky Webster, the head of school at Mount Airy Christian Academy, praised Bowen for her hard work and dedication throughout the internship program. “We join Caroline and her family as they celebrate this unique career opportunity for her,” Webster said in a news release. “But as a close-knit school family, we are also praying for her safety, too.” Bowen said she isn’t sure when her time at Carroll Hospital will be coming to an end, but she’s grateful for the chance to be working with its staff during the coronavirus pandemic. She’s planning for her future at Stevenson and its nursing school in the fall, and she’ll be heading there with valuable hours logged. “It’s definitely a great experience,” Bowen said. “I get to see how everything runs in the hospital, to have first-hand experience, to be able to help these people. They’re not allowed to have any visitors right now. I’m one of the only people that they’re really allowed to talk to. “It just feels like I’m really able to do something right now instead of sit home and wait.”

Carroll County’s first ‘community’ coronavirus death reported, along with 3 more at Mount Airy nursing home
.W
Four more people have died from COVID-19 in Carroll County, officials announced Tuesday, including the first death of a person outside of the two local elder care facilities most affected by the novel coronavirus so far. The first death of a person not living in Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy or Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster was a man in his 80s, according to Maggie Kunz, health planner for the Carroll County Health Department. Kunz said no further details were available about that case April 7. Three additional deaths reported Tuesday on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage were residents at Pleasant View, the site of the first five deaths in Carroll County due to COVID-19. Kunz said there was no specific information yet available on those three additional deaths Tuesday evening, but it bring the total number of people who have died due to COVID-19 at the facility to 17; 81 residents and 31 staff members at the facility have tested positive for the virus. No new deaths were reported Tuesday at Carroll Lutheran Village, where one person has died of COVID-19 and 12 residents — and two staff members — have tested positive so far. But while those facilities have been affected most heavily thus far — the coronavirus is particularly threatening to older populations and those with compromised health — , the spread of COVID-19 in the broader community, as reflected by this first death reported Tuesday, will also change the health department’s focus going forward, according to Kunz. “As cases rise in the community, we are shifting to a broader focus on community data,” she said. “We are also sharing more information on community-wide prevent and preparedness measures.” Total positive cases in Carroll County now stand at 162, according to the health department data, 54 of which are people in the “community," that is, not residents or staff of Pleasant View or Carroll Lutheran Village. Of those, 35 are women and 19 are men, while 13 are between the ages of 20 and 29; six are between ages 30 and 39; 11 between ages 40 and 49; 16 between ages 50 and 59; six between ages 60 and 69; and one person each between the ages of 70 and 79, and 80 and 89. There are no community cases involving anyone age 90 or older, according to the data. Nationwide, as of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the coronavirus had resulted in more than 12,200 deaths in the United States out of more than 387,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic March 11. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Upper Chesapeake Health bolsters testing capabilities; Harford County Council updated on coronavirus
.W
With the novel coronavirus rippling through Maryland, infecting 267 in Harford County and killing at least two residents, much has changed for University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, Dr. Faheem Younus told the Harford County Council. Thankfully, that is good change, as the hospital system works to streamline its processes and care for patients afflicted with the respiratory illness, said Younus, UCH’s chief quality officer and chief of infectious diseases. UCH is treating 24 coronavirus patients, he said during the council’s Tuesday night meeting. A fiberglass structure is also being constructed in Upper Chesapeake Medical Center’s parking lot, Younus said, to accommodate COVID-19 patients. Overall, Younus noted, the majority of cases in Maryland emanate from five places: Baltimore City and Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. Compared to those, Harford has relatively few patients. Both Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air and Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace have their own testing equipment, Younus said, and can get test results for patients back in a matter of hours. "A month ago, if a patient came to us and we wanted to check whether they had COVID or not … [the test] would go downtown and in some cases it would take five to seven days before we knew the result,” Younus said. “That was an agonizing wait.” Younus said the outpouring of support for the hospital and its staff has been immense; many send the hospital workers food or just kind words to show their appreciation for the front-line workers — some of whom have caught the sickness. Younus worried that the virus may spike after its first peak, and the state may crest multiple waves of patients, but he could not say with certainty what would happen as medical professionals are still gathering information on the virus. "What keeps me up at night is that we may have crossed our peak, but we may have other peaks left to cross,” he said. Maryland Department of Health data on Wednesday morning showed two confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Harford as well as six “probable” deaths in the county among the 267 who have been infected with the respiratory illness. County Executive Barry Glassman and Harford County Health Department announced Harford’s first confirmed coronavirus death last Friday, a 27-year-old male with underlying health conditions. Molly Mraz, a spokesperson for the county health department, said it would not be communicating any details about the second confirmed death or any other additional COVID-19 deaths. More than two-thirds of Harford’s confirmed cases are concentrated in the central part of the county, with a combined 71 in Bel Air’s two ZIP codes, 47 in Forest Hill, 46 in Edgewood and 24 in Abingdon. Six other ZIP codes are reporting eight or more cases, the threshold for which the state releases ZIP code level data.

Former Maryland football player Ellis McKennie says his father tested positive for coronavirus
.W
The father of former Maryland offensive lineman Ellis McKennie has tested positive for the coronavirus, the younger McKennie announced Monday. “Please pray for my father. He tested positive for covid-19 this morning,” Ellis wrote in a Twitter post. “He was diagnosed with pneumonia last week but it got worse. Luckily I haven’t been around him but my mom and sister are in quarantine while he is in the hospital. All we can do is stay positive and pray.” Ellis appeared in 40 games for Maryland and started 10 games in 2019. He was selected by the media as Honorable Mention All-Big Ten and became the first offensive lineman since 1997 to start at four different positions in one season. The McDonough graduate also notably became an outspoken leader for Maryland as it handled the aftermath of the death of offensive lineman Jordan McNair and the firing of former head coach DJ Durkin. An additional 44 cases of coronavirus in Maryland were announced Monday, bringing the total to 288.

Maryland reports 44 new coronavirus cases since Sunday bringing total to 288 
.W
An additional 44 cases of the new coronavirus were reported in Maryland on Monday, bringing the state’s total to 288. The majority of cases, 236, were reported in people between age 18 and 64, said Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. People over the age of 65 accounted for 49 cases. Three children were also confirmed to have COVID-19. The majority of cases have been found in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, with 93 and 47 cases, respectively. Baltimore City has 31 cases, Baltimore County has 35 and Anne Arundel County has 20 cases. The state updates the number of cases confirmed each day at 10 a.m. while counties and local jurisdictions may announce cases separate from those confirmed by the state. The governor is expected to announce further emergency orders around 11 a.m. Keep up with the latest coronavirus updates here.

Living in the 21215 ZIP code; a coronavirus hot spot | COMMENTARY
.W
I have been pretty vigilant about trying to protect myself and others from the spread of coronavirus since mid-March. That’s when The Sun ordered employees to start working from home — and the first time I really grasped the true threat of the virus. I wore a mask in public — and got plenty of strange looks because of it — way before the Centers for Disease Control recommended it. I wash down my groceries, packages and mail. Yeah, I know some say there is no need for that, but it makes me feel better. And it can’t hurt, right? I’ve also drastically limited my time outside of the house, turning down requests to visit friends even at their homes. After all, I don’t know who they’ve been around. But even with this over aggressiveness, I wondered if even that was enough after the state last week began releasing coronavirus cases by ZIP code and I came to the kick-in-the-gut realization that I live in the number one hot spot in the state. The epicenter of coronavirus activity in Maryland is in ZIP code 21215. Data released that first day showed 137 cases, more than anywhere else in Maryland. As of Friday at 1 p.m., there were 238 cases. I already have enough factors that increase my odds of getting coronavirus. I am African American. And as we all now know, after the state was pushed to start tracking cases by race, people who look like me are way more likely to end up with the virus than any other race. A survey released last week by Pew Research Center found that 27% of black people personally knew someone who was hospitalized with or died from COVID-19, compared to just 1 in 10 white and Hispanic people. I personally know three people, all black, who have suffered from it, including one who died. I also have a preexisting condition, which could possibly make it harder to fight off the disease. And now I can add where I live to the risk factors. It’s enough to keep me awake some nights. As I drove around the ZIP code one day recently, I saw many desolate streets and people wearing masks, all signs people are heeding the warnings coming from public health officials to social distance and stay at home. But I also saw too many people gathering outside of corner stores and liquor retailers. Two squeegee boys approached my car sans masks or any other protective gear. At least one person rolled their window down to give them money, leaving the possibility open for disease transmission. The setup at the public transportation hub at Mondawmin Mall makes it logistically difficult for people to keep away from each other even if they wanted to. Many people have no choice but to use the bus and subway system to get to jobs. Now that the state is tracking demographic data, I hope they use it to better target these areas for education campaigns and testing. We also need a better understanding of why African Americans and certain neighborhoods are getting hit hard. Some of it is behavioral for sure, but what other biological factors are playing a role. Plenty of people of other races are also ignoring social distancing rules. The area has gotten extra resources to combat the outbreak, including the first drive-through testing site in the city. As part of surge planning, the state slated 271 surge beds and 63 intensive care beds at Sinai Hospital. Only Johns Hopkins Hospital has numbers that significantly exceed that level in the city, according to the governor’s office. As for me, I have calmed down since first learning I am living in somewhat of a coronavirus danger zone. Don’t get me wrong, my mind sometimes still races at night and keeps me awake. I have gotten a lot of reading done during this pandemic. But I also can’t live my life in a state of paranoia either. I remind myself that there are far more people recovering from coronavirus than dying from it. Far more people have tested negative for the virus than positive. Those odds are good for everyone. Many of the cases in 21215 are also concentrated at the FutureCare Lochearn nursing home. So, I will continue to be vigilant about washing my hands, wearing a mask and keeping my distance from people. My ZIP code is a risk factor, but not necessarily a death sentence. Andrea K. McDaniels is The Sun’s deputy editorial page editor.

Maryland won’t detail nursing home coronavirus outbreaks, saying ‘disclosure serves no public health purpose’
.W
Maryland health officials have denied a request from The Baltimore Sun for a list of nursing homes across the state with confirmed coronavirus outbreaks, saying “the disclosure serves no public health purpose." Though states including California, Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey recently began sharing such information, Maryland will not follow suit out of concern for patient privacy, wrote Heather Shek, assistant director of the state health department’s office of governmental affairs, in a letter to The Sun. She said providing the list “could lead to the identification of specific persons who have tested positive.” State health officials also say disclosure “would not contribute to preventing the further spread of the disease,” Shek wrote, because nursing homes are restricting visitor access under an executive order by Gov. Larry Hogan. “Public disclosure of the information about positive test results at nursing homes does not help to protect the public since visitors have not been permitted at these facilities for several weeks,” Shek wrote. “Only staff and residents are affected by the presence of persons with positive tests in the nursing home.” There are now confirmed COVID-19 cases in 169 of Maryland’s 226 nursing homes, state officials said Thursday. About three-fourths of the at least 680 people the virus has killed in the state are age 60 or older. Nursing home leaders say they requested a list of those facilities from the state earlier this month and also were denied. They say it is necessary to help them identify staff who work in multiple nursing home facilities, and could be exposed to the virus in one and spread it to another. Kevin Heffner, president of LifeSpan Network, a nursing home industry group, said transparency is key to protecting the many contractors who are still coming in and out of nursing homes, including pharmacy, dining services and medical equipment staff. “If the positive test information were more readily available, those contractors could take steps to limit the employees and drivers who are potentially exposed to the virus,” he said. LifeSpan and other nursing home groups also are pressing the state to conduct universal coronavirus testing of all nursing home residents and staff, citing the 500,000 new tests the state acquired from South Korea. Family members of nursing home residents also have called for more information about outbreaks as they try to monitor their loved ones’ well-being from afar. “As each day of the pandemic passes, family members, staff and communities are becoming increasingly worried about the health and safety of those inside long-term care facilities,” wrote Hank Greenberg, director of AARP Maryland, in letter to the editor of The Sun. “The lack of transparency from state health officials and facilities only adds anxiety.” Anna Palmisano, co-founder of Marylanders for Patient Rights, called it “outrageous” for the state to suggest the information would not serve public health. Families need it to make decisions on how to keep their relatives safe, including potentially bringing them home, she said, adding that not all nursing homes have been transparent about outbreaks in their facilities. “You don’t know how at risk your beloved family member is,” Palmisano said. “You don’t have the opportunity to act in a responsible manner for someone you love.” The Sun requested the information under the Maryland Public Information Act. In the state’s response, Shek cited a state health law that says reports on infectious disease at hospitals and other health facilities are not subject to public inspection. The federal government is seeking to make the information more public, however. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services this week proposed requiring all nursing homes report COVID-19 outbreaks to residents, residents’ families and staff within 12 hours of confirming cases, and to report them directly to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But federal regulations imposing that requirement are not yet in place. Shek said the state “expects full compliance by all nursing home operators” in providing that information. Shek added that state and local health departments “are closely monitoring outbreaks at nursing homes and other congregate living facilities, assessing facility practices and resources, and engaging on-site ‘go teams’ to provide additional support when indicated.” As the nursing homes continue to try to contain or prevent outbreaks, they are asking for more state help testing residents and staff for the virus. Heffner, of the LifeSpan Network, and the leaders of LifeSpan and two other nursing home industry groups, the Health Facilities Association of Maryland and Leading Age Maryland, are urging Hogan to use some of the 500,000 coronavirus tests the state recently obtained from South Korea to conduct universal testing on all of their residents and staff. In a letter to the governor, they said the lack of coronavirus testing has made it difficult for nursing home administrators to “proactively manage their communities.” Testing availability has remained limited for those not showing symptoms of COVID-19 infection but believed to have introduced the virus to vulnerable elderly populations. “While we understand the challenges associated with testing asymptomatic individuals, waiting for both employees and residents to develop symptoms almost guarantees additional infections,” they wrote in a letter to Hogan. Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci said “all options are under consideration” as the state moves to roll out increased testing, noting that the governor said Monday that the surge of new tests would go to “high-priority areas, such as nursing and group homes.” The nursing home officials say increased testing could help prevent more outbreaks like some of the worst known to hit the state. Health officials have said it was an asymptomatic staff member who sparked the outbreak at Pleasant View nursing home in Mount Airy, where at least 26 of the 98 residents have died from COVID-19. And it was universal testing of residents and staff, sought out by nursing home operator FutureCare over concern about possible asymptomatic spread of the virus, that revealed an outbreak infecting at least 129 residents and 41 staff members at FutureCare Lochearn. At least two residents there have died, according to family members. Baltimore Sun reporter Phil Davis contributed to this article.

Maryland coronavirus cases, deaths continue to increase, but current hospitalizations flatten Saturday
.W
Maryland continues to see increases in confirmed cases and deaths from the coronavirus, but Saturday showed a slight decline in hospitalizations, which state officials have said is key to the eventual rollback of social distancing measures. The state counted an additional 1,001 confirmed coronavirus cases and 58 additional deaths since Friday. A total of 1,156 people have died of the disease in Maryland. The number of people hospitalized Saturday was 1,657, which is 11 fewer from the day before, according to figures compiled by the state health department. The state reported a peak of 1,711 hospitalizations Thursday. Gov. Larry Hogan has said a decrease in hospitalizations will serve as a key factor in deciding when to ease restrictions on gatherings, businesses, nonessential travel and other activities that were imposed beginning in March in order to limit the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “When we start seeing a downward trajectory or a consistent plateauing of those metrics, that can put us in a position to consider lifting the stay-at-home order and beginning our gradual, safe and effective recovery plan,” Hogan said last week. Of the 1,657 people hospitalized, 1,091 remain in acute care and 566 are in intensive care. Nearly 5,000 people have been hospitalized since the pandemic began. The areas with the most cases continues to be around the Washington, D.C., suburbs, in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. However, several ZIP codes around the Baltimore area continue to see a higher number of cases, including 21215 with 383 cases, 21228 with 308 cases and 21224 with 289 cases. The state also reported Saturday there have now been 101,049 negative tests and 95 deaths that were likely caused by COVID-19 but have not been confirmed by a laboratory test. Saturday’s increase in cases is smaller than the increase reported Friday, when state officials said 1,730 confirmed cases represented the state’s largest single-day increase yet. The spike in Friday’s numbers was attributed to the state’s increasing testing capabilities. The state also reported 4,894 negative tests, partially attributed to a backlog of tests reported from an outpatient facility, state officials had said.

Maryland’s confirmed coronavirus cases increase by 736, a slight decline from Friday’s new cases
.W
Maryland has added 736 confirmed cases of the coronavirus Saturday, state officials announced, bringing the state’s total to 12,308 and a total of 463 fatalities. The number of deaths increased by 38 since Friday. The state also said there have been a total of 71 deaths of those who probably died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the novel coronavirus but whose cases have not been confirmed by a laboratory test. More than 53,000 Marylanders have tested negative for the disease, according to the state’s report. State officials said 771 people have been released from isolation. The number of new cases represents a slight decline from Friday, when 788 new cases were confirmed. Baltimore City officials also announced Saturday the first death of a city employee due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Michael Baptist, a contract services specialist in human resources at the Baltimore Police Department, died Friday evening, according to a city news release. He had been with the department since 1971 as a sworn officer. After retiring as a sergeant, Baptist eventually rejoined the department as a civilian investigator. “Our hearts are extremely heavy as we all work to process the passing of Mr. Baptist,” Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said in a statement. “On behalf of the residents of Baltimore, I offer sincere condolences to his family, loved ones, and members of the Baltimore Police Department. Mr. Baptist was a dedicated public servant, who decided to spend his well-earned retirement in further service to our City.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan cautioned Friday that the state has not yet reached a peak of cases and deaths. “We’ve slowed the growth and we’ve blunted that curve, but we are unfortunately on the way up that slide,” the Republican governor said Friday morning during a teleconference with The Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “We believe we are getting close to the peak in the next week or so, but time will tell.” The state recently began releasing case information by ZIP code. The 21215 ZIP code covering portions of Northwest Baltimore has the highest case count, with 253. Prince George’s and Montgomery counties continue to outpace other counties in cases, with 3,160 and 2,404 cases, respectively. The state’s release of racial and ethnic data continues to reveal disparities between groups. Black Marylanders account for about half of the cases and deaths in which race is known. However, African Americans account for just 30% of the state’s population. While more women have been diagnosed with COVID-19, more men have died from the disease. State health officials said 218 women have died and there have been 37 additional deaths of women who probably died from the COVID-19 illness but whose cases have not been confirmed by a laboratory test. Men have accounted for 244 fatal cases and an additional 34 probable deaths, state officials said. There have been 6,652 confirmed cases among women and 5,656 among men.

Baltimore crime update: Robberies, assaults plunge, shootings dip as coronavirus shutters city 
.W
Overall reported crime in Baltimore continues to plunge amid the coronavirus outbreak. Property crime had already been on a steep decline since a state of emergency was declared in mid-March. Violent crime had seen less of an impact, but has been falling since then as well. For the week ending April 18, police reported 71 total violent crimes. That was less than half of the 152 violent crimes reported the previous week. The week ending March 21 saw 196 violent crimes. Total violent crimes for the past month are down 26% compared with the same period last year. The figure reported for the week ending April 18 was a 61% decline compared to the same week last year. During the early days of the state of emergency, gun violence continued unabated, with homicides actually higher than the same period last year. Twenty-five people were shot and wounded, and five others killed in the week ending March 21. But those numbers have declined. One person was killed last week, with six others shot and wounded. The previous week, ending April 11, saw seven homicides and nine non-fatal shootings. Total shootings and gun-related homicides are down 33% over the past month compared to last year. There were 27 robberies recorded for the week ending April 18, continuing a downward trend in that category: Fifty-seven people were reported to have been robbed the previous week, and more than 80 robberies were reported for the each of the weeks ending March 14 and March 21. Robbers appear to have adjusted their tactics somewhat: while street robberies and commercial robberies are down compared to last year, home invasions are up 63% for the year. Baltimore was called the “robbery capital” by U.S. Attorney William P. Barr, because the city far and away led the country in robberies per capita in 2018. Aggravated assaults fell from 109 during the week ending March 21, to 43 last week. Total property crime is down 46% over the past month, compared to the same period last year. Experts have said that it’s expected that crime would decline during stay at home directives and orders that have shuttered businesses. Arrests are down 25% for the year, compared to last year.

‘This is what we trained for’: Nurses at Baltimore’s Mercy Hospital volunteer for coronavirus duty
.W
A coronavirus patient, an elderly man, was struggling, his moans cutting through the rhythmic pulse of the ventilator in his room at Mercy Hospital. Cindy Voith of Towson, his nurse, tried to give comfort. “His family said he liked ‘God Bless America,’ so I began to sing it, though I’ve got the worst voice ever,” said Voith, an R.N. “He was sedated, but he recognized the song and tried to join in.” She’d struck a chord, which was what she was hoping for. The patient later died. “You make the end comfortable — and that’s very big to nurses,” Voith, 58, said. “Even if the outcome isn’t good, you do all you can to treat each patient with dignity.” Two months ago, Voith worked in Mercy’s recovery room. The pandemic changed that. With elective surgeries waning, the hospital offered nurses in many units the opportunity to cross-train and possibly treat COVID-19 patients. Voith and Brian Avaritt were among the first of 71 to volunteer. Like Voith, Avaritt, an easy-going 6-foot, 2-inch caregiver whom colleagues call “Big B,” worked in recovery but also has intensive care unit know-how. “Both Cindy and Brian have charge nurse leadership experience, a compassion for patients and a willingness to do whatever is needed in this crisis,” said Kristy O’Neill, Director of Perianesthesia Services at Mercy. Neither nurse said they fear for their own well-being while treating COVID-19 victims, given the safety gear that covers nearly every inch of their skin, head to toe. “The plastic face shield makes me feel like a welder,” Voith said. Avaritt, 35, of Ellicott City, said he is “more fearful of getting the virus in the grocery store than from my patients. The hospital PPE [personal protective equipment] gives me peace of mind; it’s my ‘blankie.’ Plus, I probably wash my hands, gosh, hundreds of times a day." In public, he said, “I’m more hyper vigilant about what I touch and whom I talk to. In conversations, I find myself listening for any lung issues and assessing people to see if they are sick.” At times he looks inward, like after finishing a meal in the break room at Mercy. “Sometimes you cough just to clear your [throat,]” Avaritt said. "Then you wonder: is that the COVID or just me clearing my throat?” But that’s forgotten when he heads back to work in his PPE passing through a network of safety doors, plastic walls and anterooms, which aid in preventing the spread of infection. “Behind all that [gear] you try to be as human as you can,” Voith said. "You sit with them; you hold their hands. . And whether or not a patient goes home, you tell yourself, ‘this is what we trained for.’ ”

How to roast mushrooms with Baltimore’s Foraged chef and owner Chris Amendola while coronavirus sheltering
.W
With restaurants closed by the coronavirus pandemic, The Baltimore Sun is asking area chefs how to prepare simple dishes at home. Previously: Beginner’s guide to scrambled eggs & broccoli with Bar Vasquez chef Foraged chef and owner Chris Amendola is into mushrooms. Wooden mushrooms decorate the counter that separates the kitchen from the dining room of his Hampden restaurant. Dried mushrooms Amendola has found in the woods hang on the wall. (Amendola doesn’t recommend trying this at home; for the layperson, it can be nearly impossible to distinguish a toxic mushroom from a safe one). And naturally, mushrooms feature prominently on the menu at Foraged, his “hyper-seasonal eatery” on Chestnut Ave., bringing a rich, umami flavor to stews, risotto and brussels sprouts marrow. When it comes to cooking mushrooms at home, Amendola has the following words of advice: Store mushrooms in a brown paper bag before use to prevent excess moisture from building up  You don’t need to wash cultivated mushrooms before cooking  Before cooking, chop off stems of mushrooms. If you like, you can set them aside to make a mushroom stock which is great way to add flavor to dishes like risotto. “It’s super easy,” Amendola says. Just add the stems to a saucepan with water. Bring to a boil and then turn down the heat and let simmer for an hour.  Rip mushroom caps up with your hands before roasting. Place on a tray and add olive oil. Cook in a 375 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until golden brown.

Over 200 coronavirus cases reported in Maryland Prison system, department says
.W
Over 200 cases of the new coronavirus have been detected in Maryland’s prison system, according to the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. Fifty inmates have been diagnosed with the disease, which has stricken a total of 217 people affiliated with the department. Jessup Correctional Institution has 52 total cases, including 17 inmates, 22 correctional officers and administrative employees, giving it the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases in the state system. One inmate died at the facility on April 13. Other facilities impacted include the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women at 36 cases; the maximum security Patuxent Institution with 35 cases; the Dorsey Run Correctional Facility at 26; and the Maryland Correctional Institution for men with 13 cases. The Maryland Reception, Diagnostics and Classification Center in Baltimore has 29 total cases with 2 inmates and 27 officers, making it the highest highest total of correctional officers confirmed to be diagnosed with the virus in the state, according to the department’s count. The Metropolitan Transition center has a confirmed 22 cases of COVID-19, 20 of them officers and one inmate. Other Baltimore area facilities affected include: the Chesapeake Detention Center, the Baltimore City Correctional Center, Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center and the youth detention center. Three cases were confirmed in correctional facilities in both Cumberland and Hagerstown. A total of 24 officers and 15 inmates have recovered from the virus, according to the department. Cases of COVID-19 have rapidly increased over the last month, leaving many inmates resorting to crafting their own masks. Ryan King, the Director of Research and Policy at the Justice Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., believes the numbers of cases in the state prison system could be higher than the department has reported. Maryland is one of 14 states who aren’t regularly reporting rates of testing at prions, and the state has not acted as aggressively to free inmates as some others hard hit by the virus, prisoner rights advocates and some local officials have said. King says these states have regularly indicated the number of inmates who have tested both positive and negative along with the number of inmates who have been placed on quarantine. Because Maryland has not reported on these numbers, King believes there is a chance that there could be unknown cases throughout state facilities. “Our concern is there is a lot of staff and a lot individuals that could be likely positive for this virus. There could be a significant number of unknown cases in the facility." A nationwide review of data from 37 states conducted by a group of criminal justice scholars found that 8,866 inmates have tested positive compared to 2,938 inmates. The group formed a website, COVID Prison Data, that collects and shares its data and findings.

4 coronavirus cases confirmed at Westminster Healthcare Center, with 20 more in isolation, spokesperson says
.W
Four residents of a Westminster nursing home have COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a corporate spokesperson. Of the facility’s 116 residents, four have tested positive and 20 more are in isolation, according to spokesperson Fred Stratmann. Those in isolation are either new admissions or are considered at risk because they are showing symptoms or were potentially exposed to a case, he said. Stratmann said his earlier statement, that there were 16 cases presumed to be positive in addition to the four confirmed ones, was incorrect. One resident has been hospitalized, he said. There have been no deaths as of April 14. “We’re still treating them as if they are positive,” he said Tuesday. Just before 5 p.m. Tuesday the Carroll County Health Department announced only two new confirmed cases countywide but one more death. As of April 14 there have been 252 confirmed cases and 31 deaths, with 149 cases and 27 deaths coming from long-term care facilities. The death announced Tuesday was a community member not connected to such a facility. Of the 103 cases not at a long-term care facility, 48 are women and 55 are men, while two are between the ages of 10 and 19; 20 are between ages 20 and 29; eight are between ages 30 and 39; 15 between ages 40 and 49; 37 between ages 50 and 59; 11 between ages 60 and 69; six between ages 70 and 79; and four between ages 80 and 89. Westminster Healthcare Center, part of CommuniCare Family of Companies, learned of its first case April 3, Stratmann said. The company is based in Cincinnati and has 90 nursing homes in seven states, with 18 facilities in Maryland. The positive and at-risk residents are being kept separate from other residents, Stratmann said, and staff dedicated to caring for the residents in isolation are not caring for other residents, so as not to spread the disease. He said residents and staff are being checked for symptoms daily. The facility set up a self-contained isolation unit with a double plastic wall and sealed edges, according to Stratmann. There is a decontamination unit for supplies, and personal protective equipment to care for isolated residents is kept inside the isolation zone. Nursing homes and similar facilities are areas of concern for the spread of the coronavirus because it can be especially dangerous for older adults and those will compromised health. As of April 14, long-term care facilities have accounted for 27 of 31 deaths from COVID-19 in Carroll County. Of Carroll’s 252 positive tests for the coronavirus, 149 are connected to long-term care facilities. Twenty-four of those who died were residents of Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, as of April 14. One of the employees at Pleasant View also worked for CommuniCare Family of Companies, at Hagerstown Healthcare Center, according to Stratmann. That employee was fired from the Hagerstown facility after it was discovered that the employee was dishonest about having a second job at Pleasant View during the pandemic, he said. Stratmann said the company has not made any decisions on whether to pursue charges against that employee. Andrea Mack’s father John, 74, is one of the Westminster Healthcare Center residents who tested positive. He was hospitalized April 10, but his daughter did not know that until April 12. It wasn’t the nursing home that notified her, but a friend who accidentally broke the news, she said. The friend, who works at Carroll Hospital, asked Mack how her father was doing. From there, Mack made frantic phone calls. The nursing home told her they lost the living will and medical care power of attorney paperwork that would have ensured Mack received a call when her father was hospitalized. Without it, the hospital refused to talk to her either. Now that Mack has forwarded the paperwork to the hospital and nursing home, she has an idea of her father’s status. “I thought my dad was dead,” she said. By now, she has learned that he is on a ventilator and is “not doing well." Stratmann declined to comment on Mack’s situation, saying it would be a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to discuss a resident’s care. Mack did not know there were COVID-19 cases at the home, nor did she know her father was symptomatic prior to him being hospitalized. “No one would give me any information," Mack said. Stratmann said that while it’s the company’s policy for corporate to speak on behalf of the individual nursing homes, he said that how each facility communicated with family of residents was up to each director. He said family members of positive residents are notified as soon as a test is confirmed. “The center has also sent two letters to all resident family members on the situation,” Stratmann wrote in an email. “This was done prior to the state’s requirement that all family members be notified within 24 hours of a positive test.” Kristy Harrison’s father Doug, 74, is another of the other residents with COVID-19. She hasn’t been able to see him in a month, she said. “I went from every day seeing my father to not at all," Harrison said. Her father was taken to Carroll Hospital on April 3 after he fell, wasn’t responding and had a high temperature. A hospital staff member told Harrison and her sister to get in touch with hospice because he wasn’t doing well. Then Harrison learned the hospital was sending her father back to Westminster Healthcare Center. Harrison did not know what the nursing home was doing to protect residents from COVID-19 and she was not informed of any other cases at the facility. “For me it’s like pulling teeth trying to find out anything,” Harrison said. “I want to make sure other family members know people have [coronavirus] in there.” She conceded that staff have a lot on their hands, but wishes they communicated better. Harrison felt some relief when she was told her father’s nurse at the nursing home volunteered to go into isolation to continue to care for him. Westminster Healthcare Center implemented prevention protocol March 3 and on March 10 restricted visitors to end-of-life situations, according to Stratmann. The facility’s prevention plan included: increased cleaning; sending an informational letter to residents, families, health care providers and staff; educating residents; taking the temperature of all visitors, vendors and staff upon entering the facility, and sending those home with a fever; and ordering personal protective equipment. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

After Trump criticism over coronavirus tests, Maryland Gov. Hogan defends himself, sends president letter of thanks
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan took turns Tuesday defending himself against criticism from President Donald Trump and attempting to smooth things over with the combative president. Hogan sent a letter to Trump Tuesday afternoon thanking the president for “the continued coordination” between the federal and state governments. And he noted appreciation of Trump’s “generous offer” to make federal labs available to use for processing coronavirus tests. The letter came after the Republican governor did a series of national TV interviews in the morning, during which he defended the state’s purchase of 500,000 tests from a South Korean company. Speaking on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Hogan said he was following Trump’s recommendation that states work to acquire tests for the virus. “If there was an easier way, we certainly would’ve taken it,” Hogan said. “The president said that the governors are on their own and they should really focus on getting their own tests, and that’s exactly what we did. His message changed yesterday. I’m not sure why. “The states have been competing on the open market, the domestic market and the international market throughout this entire crisis, competing with each other and with the federal government. I’m not sure it should’ve been that way, but that’s the way it is. That’s the way the president said it had to be, so that’s what we were operating under.” During Monday’s federal coronavirus task force briefing, Trump criticized Hogan and the state’s purchase of the tests, citing the number of labs in Maryland to tout the available testing capacity. The criticism came after Hogan, on a call with Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s coronavirus response team and the nation’s governors, said many of the labs were federally owned and Maryland did not have access to them. Hogan repeated that point later Monday evening and again Tuesday on national news programs. The governor added via Twitter that the federal government had opened the labs to the state, but reiterated that the issue was a lack of tests — not lab space. “The president showed that in a press conference, basically said we didn’t have to go to Korea because look at all these things we have in our state,” Hogan said. “Well, they aren’t tests. They’re just labs that don’t have any tests." “We now have the tests, they have the labs, and that should be a great solution," Hogan added. “We should be able to now start to get to work together.” Hogan, the chair of the National Governors Association, said he and the nation’s governors had a “great conversation” Monday with Pence and Trump’s coronavirus response team, during which Hogan thanked and praised them for their efforts, he said. That left him surprised by the president’s remarks later in the day, which Hogan referred to as “biting attacks” on “The View.” Hogan said he preferred not to “Monday-morning quarterback” decisions that Trump made in the past week, month and year that could have altered or prevented Maryland’s need to work with South Korea to acquire testing kits. “At this point in the crisis, it’s hard to go back,” Hogan said. “What I think most governors are doing is, we’re doing what we have to do, and this is exactly what the president has told us to do,” Hogan continued. "Just yesterday, he was saying that the governors are responsible for this, they’re on the front lines. We should just get it done, and then we did get it done, and then we got criticized, so I’m not sure how things could be different.” Hogan added during an appearance Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” that he had yet to speak with Trump directly about the disagreement. “Hopefully, we’ll get a chance to talk," Hogan said. “I think the vice president corrected him yesterday in the press conference." Hogan’s afternoon letter to Trump struck a conciliatory tone, but also nudged the administration to keep its promise to allow the state to use federally owned labs for testing. “I was grateful to hear of your generous offer to allow the state of Maryland to access these federal labs for our testing,” Hogan wrote. “I am writing to personally thank you and the vice president and to request guidance on how we can immediately proceed on this important federal-state collaboration. I look forward to continuing to work with you and your great team.” In addition to disagreeing with Trump’s promotion of nationwide protests to reopen the economy, Hogan also questioned Trump’s tweet announcing he would sign an executive order to ban immigration into the United States, though Hogan said he hadn’t seen the tweet because “I try not to pay any attention to the tweets from the president.” The president announced late Monday what he described as a “temporary suspension of immigration into the United States." He said the executive order he planned to sign as soon as Wednesday would apply only to people seeking permanent residency. “It’s just, I think, a distraction from what’s really going on,” Hogan said of the immigration issue on “The View." “My wife is a first-generation immigrant from South Korea and just helped us through those relationships acquire half a million tests from the folks there in South Korea that’s gonna help save lives in our state, and that’s what we’re really focused on here," the governor said. "We have some terrific people from all around the world that are working in our hospitals, in our health care system, that are saving people’s lives, and we appreciate it.”

‘I have real serious concerns’: Trump’s comments about coronavirus prompted this Johns Hopkins official to speak out
.W
President Donald Trump expressed frustration during a White House media briefing Monday night about how shutting down public activities nationwide amid the coronavirus pandemic threatens to disrupt the U.S. economy. Hours later, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security sounded off on Twitter that curtailing the restrictions would be detrimental. Tom Inglesby tweeted a long thread Monday night, which has been shared by thousands of people, highlighting how social distancing and other limitations have stopped the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. Inglesby is one of the doctors advising Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan every morning on his coronavirus task force. “Anyone advising the end of social distancing now, needs to fully understand what the country will look like if we do that,” the health security director tweeted. “COVID would spread widely, rapidly, terribly, could kill potentially millions in the yr ahead with huge social and economic impact across the country.” In an interview Tuesday, he said he felt he had to say something publicly given Trump’s comments and others from people who believe that social distancing orders should be lifted. “I had been hearing and seeing various kinds of prominent voices and editorials and hearing people in and out of government talking about the near-term need to end social distancing so that the economy could get going again, and I have real serious concerns that if we do that soon, this epidemic will spread uncontrollably across this country, and in a way that would overwhelm our health care system,” he said. “So I wanted to just make that clear.” About a week ago, the Trump administration recommended Americans halt almost all activities. On Sunday night, the president said: “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. At the end of the 15-day period, we will make a decision as to which way we want to go.” At Monday’s briefing, the president doubled down on his statement and said he may soon allow parts of the nation’s economy, in regions less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening, contradicting the advice of medical and public health experts across the country, if not the globe, to hunker down even more firmly. “Let's go to work," he said. “This country was not built to be shut down. This is not a county that was built for this.” Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs chief executive, wrote on Twitter that “crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue" and suggested that “within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.” There are 349 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Maryland and more than 53,600 across the country. Worldwide there are more than 417,500 positive cases. More than 18,500 people have died across the world, including 703 U.S. deaths. Four have been from Maryland. Inglesby reminded people in his tweets that the number of those who tested positive for the coronavirus is likely much higher. Due to a shortage of COVID-19 tests, not every person who is symptomatic is being tested. Though Inglesby never mentioned Trump by name in his tweets, the director pointed at Asia, saying the continent has lowered the pandemic’s pace by properly using social distancing for nearly two months. He emphasized that it takes time to see the impact of that practice. “The impact of big interventions in Wuhan China took about 3 wks to start to reverse things. And then everyday after the situation got better,” the tweet said. “In the US, we’re about 7 to 10 days into this, depending on the state. To drop all these measures now would be to accept that COVID pts will get sick in extraordinary numbers all over the country, far beyond what the US health care system could bear.” In the tweets, Inglesby emphasized the need to continue moving ahead with closing schools and with encouraging people to telecommute and avoid gatherings. Inglesby also warned in the tweets that removing any of the preventive measures to combat COVID-19 would overwhelm hospitals and endanger those with life-threatening conditions. He said that before making changes to social distancing, there is a need for more doctors and personal protective equipment, such as gowns, masks and ventilators. Inglesby said there will also be a need for airport screening and a serology test to identify those who may have been previously infected but recovered. Once those measures are in place, Inglesby said, it would be a “far less risky time to take stock of social distancing measures in place and consider what might gradually be reduced with trial and error.” “We also need to put every conceivable econ program in place to help those being hurt by these social distancing measures,” he said. “And move ahead rapidly to get our country far better prepared to cope w COVID before people recommend we abandon our efforts to slow this virus.” Baltimore Sun reporter Kevin Rector and the Associated Press contributed to this article.

Carroll County unemployment claims decline from previous weeks but remain high during coronavirus pandemic
.W
According to data released by the Maryland Department of Labor on Thursday, over 1,000 Carroll County residents filed for unemployment in the week ending April 18, continuing the higher-than-normal rates seen during the coronavirus pandemic. In that week, 46 people applied via phone and 1,023 applied online, for a total of 1,069, the data shows. That’s down from a total of 1,423 people who filed for unemployment the week ending April 11 and almost a third of the 2,979 people who filed for unemployment the week ending April 4. Carroll saw 2,685 claims for unemployment insurance in the week that ended March 28, which was more than double the previous week’s 1,158 claims. For comparison, 31 people in Carroll filed unemployment insurance claims the first week of March. The pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has forced businesses to close and companies to furlough or lay-off employees while measures have been put in place to limit the spread of the virus. In response, Carroll County’s commissioners created a program to distribute small business grants of up to $1,250. Up to $500,000 of the county’s small business loan fund was to be used. Denise Rickell, manager at the Carroll County Business/Employment Resource Center, or BERC, has said that many people applying for unemployment are expecting to return to their previous employer when businesses re-open. BERC closed its in-person offices, but staff have been returning phone calls and offering information through BERC’s website, carrollworks.com, and Facebook page, www.facebook.com/CCBERC. On the state level, 47,545 Maryland residents filed claims for unemployment insurance the week ending April 18, a decrease of about 14,000 from the week prior. The rate of claims has declined this month after setting a record for the week ending April 4, when 108,508 Marylanders filed for unemployment. From March 15 through April 18, more than 344,000 people filed for unemployment in Maryland, easily eclipsing the roughly 215,000 jobless claims the state said it received in all of 2019. Nationally, the rate of unemployment claims continues to be high, but is also seeing a similar decrease. The federal Department of Labor said in a release that 4,427,000 people filed for unemployment insurance the week ending April 18, a decrease of 810,000 claims from the week before. Residents who typically work full time or part time are eligible for unemployment. Under state and federal legislation passed to address losses during the pandemic, benefits are now also available to some people who have not been formally laid off or work in “gig economy” jobs if they have lost work because of coronavirus-related closures or slumps in demand. A list of frequently asked questions about COVID-19 and Maryland’s Unemployment Insurance Benefits Administration is available at http://labor.maryland.gov/employment/uicovidfaqs.shtml.

Harford County has 40 cases of coronavirus, but no deaths, as of Thursday
.W
Harford County Executive Barry Glassman said the county had 40 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday afternoon, though none have died and several patients have been released from hospitals to self-isolate. Like elsewhere in the country, the virus cuts across all demographics, affecting multiple age groups from 20-years-old on up. Glassman said the virus is still most deadly to older citizens and those with preexisting conditions and that officials were trying to “look out particularly for folks who are over 60 years old.” “The data still puts them at most risk,” he said. County officials, hospitals and health officials are also in regular contact and planning for contingencies, including a sudden hotspot of cases that might put a strain on personal protective equipment and medical resources. “There is a lot of emergency planning and prep work going on every day in case we get a surge to make sure our folks here in the county have adequate medical supplies,” Glassman said of the protective equipment. With the opening of a drive-through testing site at University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, Glassman said he expects more cases to be confirmed as access to testing broadens. Only people with orders from their doctors can be tested at UCH currently. Glassman also said hospitals have been keeping track of their available bed-space and ventilators, believing they have enough currently and preparing for the event of a surge in cases. Accountants, too, have been documenting expenditures in case federal disaster relief funds are paid to the county. That could be a slow process — and may not happen — but Glassman said the county is documenting their expenses just in case. “If the federal government does reimburse us, we want to be able to capture as many of those federal dollars as we can,” he said. “That federal money takes a while to flow down to the state and even longer to flow to counties.” The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Maryland jumped 17% Thursday to more than 2,000, and scores of out-of-work residents have filed for unemployment benefits as businesses continued to shut their doors in response, state officials said. Five more people have died in Maryland, bringing the state’s death toll to 36 from COVID-19, the global pandemic that has infected more than 800,000 people and killed nearly 40,000 internationally. The state announced 13 coronavirus deaths Wednesday — the most in one day from the coronavirus, officials said. With 346 new positive coronavirus cases in Maryland, the total is now at least 2,331, according to the state. Another 18,890 COVID-19 tests have come back negative, officials said. Eighty-one people have been released from isolation. Of the positive cases, 1,194 are women and 1,137 are men. Nearly 85,000 Maryland residents filed for unemployment last week, providing a glimpse of the escalating economic fallout in the state from the COVID-19 pandemic, as businesses continued to shut their doors. According to the state Department of Labor, 84,230 Marylanders filed for unemployment either over the phone, online or by mail during the week ending March 28. Of those, 4,143 came from Harford County. That’s almost double the 42,334 state residents who filed for unemployment the week before. They were far from alone: a record 6.6 million Americans across the country filed for unemployment last week. Baltimore Sun reporters Phil Davis, Pamela Wood, Scott Dance and Justin Fenton contributed to this article.

Baltimore will secure all playground equipment as people ignore coronavirus guidelines
.W
Baltimore will move to secure all playground and exercise equipment in city-operated parks in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Families have continued to use swings and slides, despite warnings from health officials to adhere to social distancing guidelines. The Recreation and Parks Department last month removed basketball hoops and tennis nets for the same reason. “After seeing people use this equipment, despite the need to practice social distancing while in public, I asked Executive Director Reginald Moore to secure these locations,” Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said Monday in a statement. “Our staff will continue to make every effort to ensure residents can stay fit and active.” The city operates more than 145 playgrounds. There are more than 870 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Baltimore, and 26 people have died from the virus.

Army researchers start coronavirus vaccine testing on primates at Maryland’s Fort Detrick
.W
Army researchers at Fort Detrick in Frederick began testing possible vaccines for the coronavirus on animals Monday, Department of Defense officials announced. The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases is performing the tests on “non-human primates,” said Jonathan Hoffman, the department’s assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, at a Pentagon press briefing Monday. The Defense Department is involved in five clinical vaccine trials while also supporting the efforts of other federal agencies, said Air Force Brig. Gen. (Dr.) Paul Friedrichs, Joint Staff surgeon. “I think it’s important for everyone to keep in mind that this is a process that is going as quickly as it can,” Friedrichs said. “We’re balancing, again, that risk of how do we make sure any vaccine candidates are safe?” After the animal trials, the testing will move to a small group of people in hopes of expanding to a larger group, Friedrichs said. Citing Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, Friedrichs noted that these efforts don’t guarantee a vaccine in the near future. “Only when we know that they are both safe and effective will we be able to offer them more widely to larger numbers," Friedrichs said. “We’re making progress on those. I don’t want to create a false expectation, though, that a vaccine is right around the corner. "As has been briefed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and many others, we are still months away, not weeks away, from a vaccine.”

Here are the 8 ZIP codes in the Baltimore region with the most coronavirus cases
.W
Maryland health officials on Sunday started reporting coronavirus data on a ZIP code level, making it easier to see what neighborhoods and areas have a high concentration of the virus. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan wrote on Twitter that the decision to release ZIP code-specific data was made “so that Marylanders can better understand the spread of this deadly virus.” The state is now up to 8,225 cases overall, including concentrations in Silver Spring in Montgomery County; Prince George’s County and areas of Baltimore City and Baltimore County.

Hunkering down: Local businesses suffer in coronavirus wake
.W
On a normal day, customers would flock to Atwater’s Catonsville for lunch, snagging an open table as soon as it became available and shuffling around each other in a snaking line from the register as they waited for their to-go orders. At 1 p.m. March 16, the Frederick Road spot was nearly vacant. A sign posted on the door advised customers the family-owned cafe and restaurant would only be providing to-go orders and would be closing for the day at 3 p.m. “just to get the flow of information streamlined,” said Casey Atwater, the location’s general manager. After federal, state and local governments ramped up decrees two weeks ago to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus and Gov. Larry Hogan ordered a two-week public school closure, March 13“was the first day I think that was significantly just dead,” bringing in just half of the typical daily sales, said Atwater, whose father owns the five Baltimore-area restaurants. That “was the turning point,” she said. Public health officials recommend social distancing — staying in one’s home and out of the public sphere — as a way to curb the pandemic by limiting exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with existing health conditions. To that end, Glen Boller, who has co-owned Catonsville Hair with his wife since 1988, voluntarily decided to close his salon on Frederick Road for the next 15 days as of March 17. Boller and his wife “struggled with making this decision,” he said March 16, but they’re “trying to stick with the guidelines." With much of the salon’s clientele being older, “we have a lot of people that have compromised immune systems that come in here,” Boller said. Most business owners, particularly restaurateurs in southwestern Baltimore County, are feeling the same strain with little time to prep after Hogan on March 16 ordered the shutdown of all movie theaters, gyms and dine-in restaurants as of 5 p.m. Sparse customers ate their lunch the afternoon of March 16 in Sorrento of Arbutus. Fire Wok, a Chinese takeout restaurant on East Drive, had seen a 50% decrease in call-in, pickup and delivery orders, owner May Chen said. At Objects Found in Arbutus, the antique and consignment shop had seen a drop in business of about 75% before picking back up over the weekend of March 14-15, according to owner Reggie Sajauskas. “We don’t even know what’s going to happen tomorrow,” said Ana Tolentino, a bartender at Fish Head Cantina in Halethorpe, where a dozen customers sat around the bar March 16. “Who’s coming in, or do we need anyone coming in at all? We’re just trying to take it a day at a time, everyone in [the restaurant] industry.” “We’re gonna get affected by it a lot. For most of us this is a main source of income,” Tolentino said. “It’s kind of out of everyone’s control,” said Teal Cary, executive director of the Greater Catonsville Chamber of Commerce. “Until the federal government comes out with more [guidelines], I think we’re all just sitting back and watching.” The chamber has gotten just a few calls from businesses regarding COVID-19, but has assumed the role of facilitating connections with Baltimore County and state resources as they continue to be rolled out, including a streamlined process for businesses to temporarily deliver alcohol to county residents announced March 17. Restaurants generate over $62 million in sales tax to Maryland each month, said Restaurant Association of Maryland president Marshall Weston Jr. “With restaurant closures, the mandated suspension of dine-in seating and significant overall decreases in business there will be financial strains on restaurants, employees and the state,” Weston wrote in an emailed statement. The association is “communicating with several state agencies" to encourage the development of relief plans “to the many employees and restaurant owners that will be affected by the loss of business,” Weston wrote. Without dine-in options, restaurants like State Fare and Atwater’s are looking for ways to keep their staff members working. Atwater said the cafe is “definitely cutting hours” but is trying to help employees fill out applications for unemployment benefits after Maryland legislaturepassed a bill to extend temporary benefits to employees who will lose their jobs due to the pandemic. At State Fare, which just began its delivery service, the restaurant’s 16 servers will start working regular shifts and delivering orders in their own cars, co-owner Evan Brown said. Curbside pick-up will still be available. The Frederick Road restaurant is also stocking toiletries, water, milk and other items running out quickly at area grocery stores, which can be ordered over the phone, Brown said. An updated list of available items will be posted daily to State Fare’s Facebook page, Brown said. As business wanes in the food service industry, the area’s small grocery stores are facing the opposite problem: keeping up with demand. At Amigos Market on Frederick Road, co-owner Esmeralda Guevara said March 17 her husband has had to drive to wholesale restaurant depots to restock items like toilet paper, milk, eggs and water as many as three times in one day. “Normally it’s like twice a week,” said Guevara, who now brings her three children to work with her since schools and her 3-year-old son’s day care have closed. “It’s been crazy.” Guevara said she’s been cleaning the counters with bleach every two hours, but the increased business has been good for the family-owned market, which opened nine months ago and was off to a slow start. “It’s a bad situation, but for us it has been good in a way,” she said. “More people have come and and they have stated they didn’t know we were here. It’s nice to have more customers.” In Safeway on Baltimore National Pike, Dymone Lewis struggled to find water, bread and eggs to fulfill customer orders through the Shipt app that allows buyers to have drivers shop for items and bring them to their homes. On Tuesday, the app had 200 pending orders from Baltimore to Annapolis, a definite increase, Lewis said.

With his shiny black coat and a face his foster mother called the “cutest little squishiest” one ever, 4-year-old Hair Tie was a popular pup when it came to adoption applications. Zia Bowen felt like she was on a first date and thought she might need a treat or a toy when she was chosen from a pool of 30 applicants to meet the dog at the Baltimore Animal Rescue & Care Shelter (BARCS) to make sure he liked her. No such enticement was needed. “It was just chemistry, immediately,” Bowen, 25, said. “And, now he’s my boy.” The dog, now named Osan, has become her shadow in her Park Heights home. He goes crazy at the words “Momma’s Boy.” He loves belly rubs, snores and getting under the covers when it’s bedtime. Osan has his forever home. But he’s also an example of how Baltimore-area animal shelters have leaned heavily on animal fostering during the coronavirus pandemic, while coping with revenue losses and spikes in food bank need. “Even though the COVID-19 situation is so drastic, luckily everyone’s kind of coming together while social distancing to help animals out, help animals in need, and build a bigger sense of community,” said Nick Crawford, social media and office manager of the Annapolis-based SPCA of Anne Arundel County. After the coronavirus pandemic arrived, one of the first steps taken was to limit the number of animals in shelters, lowering staff requirements. BARCS holds around 250 animals, and quickly moved healthy and friendly animals to foster homes, leaving between 50 and 70, executive director Jen Brause said. Foster homes typically care for an animal for a brief period; they can relieve shelter demand and help acclimate an animal to a home environment until their eventual adoption, with the shelter providing food and medical care in return for a happy home. For instance, Ariel Rubenstein, who fostered Osan for BARCS when he was still Hair Tie, has — just during the pandemic — fostered three other dogs and a cat who have been placed with homes. The Humane Society of Carroll County has over 200 animals in foster care, and is using shelter space to care for pets of coronavirus patients as they’re treated, said executive director Karen Baker. The Maryland SCPA closed its Falls Road facility on March 23 and fostered out 69 animals in three days, giving them 145 fostered animals to keep tabs on in total as they shut down adoptions. Those that are keeping them open, like BARCS, adopted practices in line with social distancing regulations. The rationale for fostering or adopting now, Brause said, is that families are home and can acclimate animals to a new setting. With fostering particularly, “People are like, ‘I can do it now. I’m not sure if I want to have an animal long-term, but we’re home,’” Brause said. “And with people being home, it’s a great new entertainment to have in your house, especially if you have kids, you have something new, something to interact with, get you a little exercise and get some fresh air with if you’re getting a dog.” Those shelters that continued adoptions show flat numbers compared with the same period last year, but also lower intake. Shelters are also laboring to fulfill spikes in demand for animal food aid. The Maryland SPCA typically serves 142 people every year through its Kibble Connection program, which helps those in need feed their pets. Since March 23 alone, they’ve helped 230 people feed 593 pets. They’re trying to secure warehouse space to accommodate the increased supply, executive director Jim Peirce said. Requests are up 20% at the Baltimore Humane Society in Baltimore County, and when the Harford County Humane Society ran low on stocks it was able to replenish them quickly with a social media call out — raising $1,000 to keep supplies up. In addition to assisting with 10 medical procedures to keep animals from being surrendered, the Howard County Animal Control and Adoption Center is filling as many as 15 food requests each week when a typical month brings five. “It’s a large increase, but the public has responded in kind,” Howard County Animal Control Administrator Deborah Baracco said. Those efforts are contributing to Maryland’s part of what seems to be a nationwide trend when it relates to COVID-19 and pets. The nonprofit collaborative Shelter Animals Count surveyed 1,127 organizations nationwide on March 2019 and March 2020 adoption and intake data, and found that shelters and rescues had 24% fewer cats and dogs entering this year compared with last, including a 28% decrease in pets surrendered by owners. With fewer animals available and adoptions suspended at some faciltiies, adoptions are down overall 11%, the study found — yet pet adoptions as compared with other outcomes were up 4%. All these efforts come as the financial and operational landscape of shelters is changing significantly. Several have had to cancel signature fundraising events, which could hurt veterinary services and outreach in the future. “You’re talking about quite a bit of money that you lose along the way because absolutely everything had to be cancelled,” Kate Pika, director of marketing and public relations for the Baltimore Humane Society, said. “That’s the downfall of it, but the uptick is everyone’s adopting a pet,” she said. Rubenstein, 37, who had fostered Osan, said she has fostered animals who garnered no interest at all over a month’s time . But she points to the fact that she has already successfully adopted out four others during the pandemic: a senior brown pitbull mix with a wide smile named Rizza, a high-energy mixed breed puppy called Voyager, a cuddly young cat name Narwahl and a 10-month-old, white, deaf puppy they called Lite Brite. She said there’s a theme among the adopters she’s worked with: “They have the time now, where they’re able to train an animal, they want that companionship.” Melissa Reynolds, a 49-year-old Reisterstown resident, estimates she’s had 55 animals through her house as fosters in the last couple of years. For those that don’t want to adopt, she says there’s plenty to like about fostering as well. “It’s exciting and new,” she said. “It’s like Christmas. What are we going to get the next time?” Crawford said the SPCA of Anne Arundel County has over 100 adoption applications pre-submitted to allow for a quicker process once they can start back up. Their peers at the Anne Arundel County Animal Care and Control Department are going live on Facebook nearly every day to show off the animals in the shelter in hopes of finding them new homes, too. “We have a lot of people looking,” Baker said, “and I’m hoping they’re still looking when all of this returns to normal, because we will definitely need adopters.”

Szymanski: Together, we will get through this coronavirus crisis
.W
It seems in uncertain times we see the best and the worst in humans. But I am focusing on this: when times get rough, Americans come out of the woodwork and shine like diamonds. On the Next Door Neighbor app, I see people here in the community of Silver Run and Union Mills reaching out with posts like this recent one, “If anyone needs food or supplies and can’t get out, I am willing to pick up and deliver items to your porch for you.” On the day that her dad was dropped off at Sinai Hospital for heart surgery, my daughter’s sweet childhood friend, Laura Crandell, sent something else along with him, over a dozen face masks she had sewn for staff. In the midst of her anxiety, she channeled her energy to do good for others. Instead of being frustrated that her dad had to be dropped at the front door, with no visitors allowed, she thought of others. And afterward, she went home to sew more. Daily posts on social media offer lists of things to keep the kids entertained while they are at home. People are reaching out to others, offering hope and help. My favorite posts are those where an adult has videoed his or herself reading a favorite children’s picture book to kids stuck at home. I’ve even discovered new books to love. My daughter, Ashley, has discovered how to play games via Facetime with relatives and friends, and yesterday, she Skyped with the grandkids, who are — like kids across the nation — at home, with no school in session. Laura said she is also grateful to be able to Skype with her dad in the hospital. Technology has made a huge difference in our lives, some good, some bad, but in this case … oh, so good! Sadly, on top of the threat of contracting the coronavirus, some have forgotten their manners, or perhaps they never had them to begin with. Too many insist on ignoring the rules, going out in large groups, not keeping their distance, and taking chances on spreading the virus to the most vulnerable. Others are hoarding toilet paper and other items, without regard to the elderly and others in need. My friend, Wendy, had a rough experience at the Dollar General store in her Pennsylvania neighborhood. She went into the store early in the morning, as that first hour was supposed to be reserved for seniors. Wendy was on a good deed mission, to get supplies for older friends who live in a subsidized high rise apartment in Baltimore, barely getting by. Wendy said the parking lot was full, and instead of seniors, the store was packed with people of all ages. “The cashier told me last night a truck had arrived earlier, followed by a crowd who surrounded her and literally stampeded the back room, tearing at the boxes,” Wendy said. “When I got there the shelves were empty. She told me the employees were staying late to sanitize and stock what was left for the morning.” Thankfully, I haven’t seen this in our neighborhood. My grocery stop has been to our local Brewer’s Market, and while it’s been busier than ever, everyone has been polite and patient and keeping the mandatory 6-foot separation in line. Wendy said, last week, a fist fight broke out in the meat section of her Walmart, and she’s seen arguments over toilet paper, with some stealing items out of other folks’ shopping carts. Sad. I often call my miniature horses, “the therapy ponies” because that is just what they offer me. Sadly, those who board their horses are not getting the full benefit of therapy these days, as even boarding facilities have had to close their doors to visits from the horse owners. So many things in our world are changing. Working for the newspaper, I get a first-hand view of the sheer number of events canceling daily. Most of these events are fundraisers for nonprofits in our community. Nonprofit organizations are so important. The services they offer fill in the cracks, with essential services for low-income and homeless families to provide the help our government agencies can’t. Nonprofits vary greatly, offering services, food and care for pets and humans, scholarships for teens, veteran services, therapeutic riding, relationship education, transport to treatment for cancer patients and addicts, meals to shut-ins, wildlife rescue, and funding for so many other important needs. Without their fundraisers, they are hurting, and now, more than ever, it’s a great time to consider donating. While you are hunkering down at home, I hope you are staying positive, reaching out to others by phone and social media, and finding ways to cope and survive. Use that extra time with the ones you love at home to do things you ordinarily wouldn’t have. You can cook together, play games, write stories or make videos together, order seeds online and start a garden, do crafts or just share family photos and history. Think about your elderly neighbors and find a way to reach out. But most of all, stay safe and well. America is going to come out of this, and we will grow strong again. If only we stay positive and be there for each other. Lois Szymanski writes from Westminster. Her Life & Times column, The Great Big World, appears every first, third and fifth Sunday.

Maryland’s first coronavirus death is Prince George’s man in his 60s 
.W
A Prince George’s County man in his 60s became Maryland’s first resident to die of the novel coronavirus, Gov. Larry Hogan announced in a tweet Wednesday night. Officials said the man died from the COVID-19 illness acquired through community transmission and said he suffered from underlying health problems. “I ask all Marylanders to join me in praying for his family and loved ones during this difficult time,” Hogan said. “As we pray for his loved ones, I ask that we continue to pray for each other, for our state, and for our nation as we face this crisis together.” This is the first death out of 85 confirmed coronavirus cases across the state. The coronavirus swept through the nation and landed in Maryland on March 5 when the first three positive cases were confirmed. Since then, more than 215,000 people have been diagnosed worldwide and 9,000 have died. Meanwhile, in the United States more than 7,700 have tested positive and 119 died, including the Prince George’s County man. Hogan said he will hold a news conference at 10 a.m. Thursday in Annapolis to “provide further updates and announce additional actions.” Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said she was “heartbroken” one of her residents lost his life to the coronavirus. “This pandemic represents an unprecedented crisis for Prince George’s County,” Alsobrooks said in a tweet. “Your County is confronting this head on and working around the clock to protect the well-being of our residents.” During a news conference on Monday, Hogan said that “we have never faced anything like this before.” “We should continue to expect the number of cases to dramatically and rapidly rise,” he said. “This is going to be much harder, take much longer and be much worse than almost anyone is currently understanding." Over the past several weeks, Hogan took unprecedented action by closing all public schools across the state and shutting down bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms in Maryland. The state’s casinos, racetracks and off-track betting parlors also have been shut down to limit the spread of the coronavirus. With Maryland under a state of emergency, Hogan has prohibited large gatherings and events of more than 50 people, in line with recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Republican governor also launched plans to add as many as 6,000 more hospital beds so current facilities don’t become overloaded. Maryland has about 8,000 acute care hospital beds, said Fran Phillips, the state’s deputy secretary for public health services.

Carroll County Commissioner Stephen Wantz to host virtual town hall on coronavirus response Thursday 
.W
The Carroll County Board of Commissioners has not been able to meet in person and take public questions since the COVID-19 state of emergency began, but that won’t stop them from trying for the next best thing: At 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Board President Stephen Wantz, R-District 1, will host the county’s first virtual town hall to answer questions about the county’s coronavirus response. “This is all about ensuring our citizens know up-to-date information on the process that everyone is working on and the ability to clear up some things they may be challenged with,” Wantz said. The town hall will not only give people a chance to pose questions to Wantz — he will also have Sheriff Jim DeWees, Carroll Hospital President Leslie Simmons, Health Officer Ed Singer and Carroll County Public Schools Superintendent Steven Lockard available during the virtual town hall. Anyone can view the virtual town hall on Youtube by visiting tinyurl.com/rsl9lf5 beginning at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday. Those interested in submitting questions can do so by submitting a question through an online form ahead of time at tinyurl.com/yxx2x7rp, or by calling in at 410-386-2043 during the virtual town hall. “I am going to be physically in the Carroll County office building and we will have a phone bank set up and I will have several of my staff there to answer phones and emails,” Wantz said. “I am going to try to keep it as focused as I can and will try to keep it to an hour and let the others know to keep their questions on point and get right to the answers so we can get in as many questions as we can.” Wantz and other county, health, first responders and emergency management staff have been holding multiple conference calls today to coordinate their response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Carroll County — as of Tuesday, there have been 162 positive cases — and Thursday’s virtual town hall represents an opportunity for citizens to learn exactly what is being done, how and why. “I would hope that since everyone seems to be staying home, we will have a lot of interest,” Wantz said. “This is the perfect opportunity to get the answers directly from those that are leading the charge.” Nationwide, as of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the coronavirus had resulted in more than 12,200 deaths in the United States out of more than 387,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic March 11. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

The Baltimore St. Patrick Parade scheduled for Sunday has been postponed due to concerns about the coronavirus. The organizers of the parade wrote on Facebook that the board of directors of St. Patrick Celebrations Inc. has decided to postpone the St. Patrick’s Day Parade and cancel the Shamrock 5K Race. “These decisions were not taken lightly, and were made thoughtfully to ensure the safety and health of the thousands of people who attend the Parade and Shamrock 5K each year,” the organizers wrote. The group wrote that no date has been chosen for the parade to be rescheduled because “of the fluid nature of the coronavirus situation.”

Pet Wise: Be positive with pets during coronavirus pandemic
.W
The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has certainly impacted many aspects of our lives, whether they be work related, recreational, appointments with doctors for ourselves and with veterinarians for our pets. We are continuously following the latest news regarding this malady that frays our nerves as we try to get through each day. Our pets can read our emotions and “feed off” our stress, which could affect their behavior and health. There are strategies we can utilize to create a calmer atmosphere within our homes for our pets and ourselves to get us through this difficult time. Calm atmosphere It has been scientifically proven that animals become calmer when they listen to classical music. The Humane Society of Carroll County plays classical music at their Shelter for the dogs and cats in their care. However, “talk radio’, news programs, loud rock and rap music agitates animals — and sometimes humans! If you do not have access to classical music, please turn on your radio to WBJC-FM. This station plays classical music 24 hours a day and the announcers have very soothing and pleasant voices. You might even recognize some of music from your childhood as tunes you heard on cartoon shows! There are calming sprays and diffusers like Feliway for cats and DAP (dog appeasing pheromone) that can be sprayed on a pet’s bedding (but not directly on the pet) that can be purchased at pet supply stores and help to relieve stress. Also establishing a daily routine for our pets and children helps to provide them with more predictability in their lives. Check pet food supply You might want to have pet food delivered to you. Contact local pet supply stores to find out if they provide this service. Many stores have curbside pickup available if you call in advance. Chewy.com might be a good source for delivery your pet’s needs. If your pet requires a prescription diet, your veterinarian may provide the food or direct you to a reliable source so that you can order it. Do not suddenly change your pet’s food but do so very gradually to prevent gastrointestinal upsets or other health issues. Vet appointments If you have already scheduled an appointment for your pet, please contact the veterinary hospital days before the appointment because many of the area animal hospitals have established new protocols and may have shortened their hours because of the COVID-19 virus. Some are only treating emergency cases and may not be providing grooming and boarding services. A pet owner may not be allowed to enter their buildings and the pet owner is asked to remain in their vehicle on the parking lot. A staff member would then come out to the vehicle and bring the pet into the hospital for the vet on duty to conduct an evaluation or treatment of the pet. Some hospitals ask the pet owner to call from their vehicle for information and to provide payment by credit card. Please note that appointments with veterinary specialists may also be delayed and will need to be rescheduled on a later date. These requirements may be a nuisance to some people, however they were put into place to protect the hospital’s staff during this unsettling time. COVID-19 and animals The United States Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories has confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans, in a tiger with a respiratory illness at the Bronx Zoo in New York, making it the first instance of an animal in the United States being infected with COVID-19. Samples from this tiger were taken and tested after several lions and tigers showed signs of respiratory illness. Public health officials believe that these large cats became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was actively shedding the virus. This investigation is ongoing. The CDC is still learning about this virus and working with human and animal health partners to monitor this situation and will continue to provide updates as information becomes available. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19. Protecting your pets If you are sick with COVID-19 (suspected or confirmed) you should limit contact with pets and other animals like you would around contacts with other people. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the following strategies: · When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. The person providing pet care should be wearing gloves, a mask and frequently washing their hands. · Avoid contact with your pet including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. · If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them. Use social distancing If you and your family have been feeling cooped up in your home and the weather is pleasant, a walk through your neighborhood with the family dog might be an enjoyable experience but should be done with caution. · The dog should be walked with a short leash (6 feet in length) and held by an alert adult. · Do not allow anyone to approach or pet your dog. You don’t know if they may be ill with COVID-19 and might sicken your dog. Be a role model Before you and your family set off for a walk, always carry “poop“ bags with you to clean up after your dog relieves himself. To further protect your hands, wear nitrile gloves and dispose of the feces in a trash can. By cleaning up after your dog, you may be preventing the spread of very nasty internal parasites like coccidia and giardia both of which are very contagious and occurs when a when a dog walks in an area where an infected dog had relieved himself. So stoop, scoop and pick up the poop! Also don’t allow your dog to walk through or drink from ponds or puddles that may contain urine from rodents that can cause deadly leptospiroris. Keep pets (and kids) busy If you have kids who are budding artists and love animals, provide them with art supplies so they may create portraits of the family pets that could be hung in their rooms or throughout the house! Karen Baker, the executive director of the Humane Society of Carroll County, suggests checking out the Pinterest website for creative activities to keep kids occupied. A fun family activity is to create enrichment toys that dispense treats like stuffing rubber Kong toys with a small dog biscuit and filling it with canned dog food. This activity can be accomplished by family members working together in an assembly line. The stuffed Kongs can be stored in a freezer and given to your dog to keep him busy in his crate when you are eating or not at home. If you have more than one dog, purchase at least two Kongs per dog, stuff and store them in your freezer. Crate the dogs separately with their Kongs. This versatile toy comes in several sizes and can be purchased from most pet supply stores and online. By the way, stuffed Kongs have been a big hit for the shelter dogs at the Humane Society of Carroll County. During this time of uncertainty about the future, enjoy the company of your pets and loved ones! Don’t forget to wear a mask, wash your hands frequently, maintain at least 6 feet of distance from other people, and please stay well. Let’s all remember that with our pets we can make the best of this bad situation. Iris Katz serves as a member of the board of directors and as an educational facilitator for the Humane Society of Carroll County. Her column appears on the third Sunday of the month.

Maryland’s coronavirus caseload multiplies by 10 during month of April as virus spread, testing expanded
.W
Maryland’s coronavirus caseload grew tenfold in April, partly a result of expanded testing efforts, while the state crossed the grim threshold of 1,000 deaths related to the virus Thursday. Maryland has confirmed 21,742 infections and 1,047 deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, compared to a reported 1,985 cases and 31 deaths as of April 1. The state added 893 cases and 62 deaths to its counts Thursday. Gov. Larry Hogan said during an interview Wednesday night on Comedy Central’s "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” that Maryland is still lagging behind where states such as New York are in the outbreak’s trajectory because both the case count and death toll continues to increase. “Sadly our numbers are on the rise and the Washington area is starting to grow,” Hogan said. “Governors are on the front lines and we are in a tough position, making really hard decisions.” Maryland’s number of currently hospitalized coronavirus patients reached 1,711 Thursday. Of those, 590 are in intensive care, also the most the state has reported for a single day. There have been 1,432 reported recoveries in Maryland. Hogan has said hospitalizations is a metric the state is tracking closely as it weighs easing coronavirus restrictions. The Republican governor also has said Maryland will not begin its reopening process until there has been a 14-day trend of decreases in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Maryland hasn’t reported more than two days in a row in which the number of new confirmed cases was lower than the day before, with no consecutive days with declines since April 19. The 14-day rolling averages of current hospitalizations and new deaths haven’t decreased from one day to the next since the state began reporting that data. Including negative tests, the 3,430 test results the state reported Thursday were the most of the past three days, a stretch that follows consecutive days with more than 7,000 reported results. On “The Daily Show” appearance, Noah pressed the Republican governor about the back-and-forth he’s had with President Donald Trump, largely on national television. Hogan, the chair of the National Governors Association, has walked a fine line between advocating for the governors while trying not to alienate the administration. But last week Trump criticized Hogan during a media briefing after Hogan had secured several thousand coronavirus tests from South Korea. The governor told Noah that he hasn’t been trying to be critical of Trump, but he “hasn’t been afraid to stand up when I think things aren’t going well.” He emphasized that he wished there would have been more support for states to secure more testing but said in the interview that the federal government is “making strides” and “has been good at addressing needs.” “We’ve butted heads a few times, but I’m not one of those folks criticizing [Trump] for no reason,” Hogan said. “The real enemy is the virus and I think there will be plenty of time to go back and take a look at what we could’ve done or should’ve done better.” As of Wednesday, 508 of the state’s victims were residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. Among those whose ages have been reported, 88% of the victims were at least 60 years old. The five ZIP codes with the most confirmed cases of the virus, and six of the top nine, are in Prince George’s or Montgomery counties, the two jurisdictions with the most confirmed cases. The 21215 ZIP code that includes parts of Baltimore County and northwest Baltimore is sixth with 359 cases. Hogan told Noah that the pandemic has prompted the most bipartisanship he’s ever seen in politics. The Republican governor referenced the multiple stimulus packages passed by Congress and that governors on both sides are actively working together on a day-day-to-basis. “I haven’t seen people wearing blue jerseys or red jerseys," Hogan said. "I’ve been seeing people asking ‘How can we help?’ ”

Trump’s declaration of Maryland as ‘major disaster’ area could mean millions to help fight coronavirus
.W
When President Donald Trump declared Maryland a major disaster area last week due to the coronavirus pandemic, state officials praised the decision. That’s because it puts the state and local governments and area nonprofits in line to receive millions — or even tens of millions — in federal dollars as they quickly respond to the outbreak. “This allows us to take every action necessary to protect the public without worrying about going outside the constraints of the budget,” said Chas Eby, deputy director of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency. The designation means the federal government will pick up the tab for Maryland’s emergency management costs and running local operation centers around the state during the response. Bulk purchases of food, water and medicine also could be covered, Eby said. Nonprofits that provide food and shelter to people during the emergency could be reimbursed as well, he added. Eby said it’s too early to even guess at the cost of the state’s coronavirus response, given the outbreak could last months. But he noted the president also signed an emergency declaration that lifts a typical cap of $5 million for reimbursements. “All disasters really start and end locally,” Eby said. “These funds can ensure we have as robust as response as possible.” Declarations of major disaster areas are typically due to natural catastrophes, such as floods or earthquakes, but the president has wide discretion to make a declaration for a public health outbreak, as well. Maryland’s last major disaster area declaration came in 2018 when the federal government awarded $13.4 million to help with deadly flooding in Howard County and related damage in Baltimore County. In 2016, the federal government awarded $7.5 million to help with another deadly Howard County flood. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has also asked Trump to reclassify the Maryland National Guard’s role in the state as a federal mission run by the state. If granted, that would mean the federal government would pay for the 2,200 members of the National Guard who are now on duty in Maryland. Members of the guard are performing a wide array of functions in the state, including helping set up makeshift hospitals and delivering box lunches to people in need of a meal. Trump has already approved the so-called Title 32 status for the guard in the states of California, New York and Washington, which have suffered some of the worst outbreaks of the coronavirus pandemic.

Harford coronavirus cases hit 111, with most patients between ages of 20 and 60, Glassman says
.W
Harford County has 111 confirmed coronavirus cases — increasing from 41 cases a week ago — as area hospitals prepare for a possible surge, County Executive Barry Glassman announced Friday. Though the county has reported zero deaths, medical professionals are preparing for a peak in cases, expected to arrive between April 18 and the beginning of May, according to a presentation by Harford County Health Officer Russell Moy to the county council earlier this week. According to Glassman’s statement, 68% of Harford’s coronavirus patients are between 20 and 60, which defied health officials initial predictions of the virus mostly affecting people 60 or older. “The vast majority of Harford’s cases are isolating at home, although some are hospitalized. Our fellow citizens remain in our prayers,” Glassman said in the statement. White House and federal officials have designated the I-95 corridor, including Harford County, as an emerging hotspot, according to Glassman’s statement, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people wear face coverings when social distancing cannot be maintained. This change comes with the realization that the mist of particles emitted during speech are enough to transmit the virus. It was also recently discovered that some people do not show symptoms, or only show mild ones, while infectious. Glassman cautioned county residents to treat everyone like they could have the virus. “Up to 25% of cases show mild or no symptoms. This means that everyone could be infectious, including yourself,” according to the statement. Glassman said that the virus will have acute effects on the local economy — foreshadowing the public release of his proposed budget Monday. He said the county is working with state and health officials to “plan for the worst and hope for the best.” “We are working closely with Gov. Hogan’s office and local surge planning is ongoing with our health department and other partners, including first responders, hospitals, nursing homes, and those who serve vulnerable populations," Glassman said in the release. Statewide, the virus has sickened over 6,900 Marylanders, corresponding to over 1,400 hospitalizations and 171 deaths as of Friday. Over 37,000 negative tests have been conducted, and 397 have been released from isolation, according to data from the Maryland Department of Health. The virus is most concentrated in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties.

Carroll Hospital, treating dozens for coronavirus, sees one unit filled as it plans to boost capacity
.W
The first signs of the coronavirus’ strain on the health care system in Carroll County appeared Tuesday morning, with one unit at Carroll Hospital reaching its current capacity with patients. “While our census changes daily, at this time our critical care unit is full, however, our intermediate care unit, medical/ surgical units and emergency department are not full,” Selena Mowery, hospital director of marketing and public relations, wrote in an email. The patients in the critical care unit are a mix of those with COVID-19 — the name for the illness caused by the novel coronavirus — and patients with other critical conditions, she said. The hospital’s critical care unit is a 12-bed — in private rooms — combination Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Coronary Care Unit (CCU) and Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU), according to the hospital website, where the most ill patients are monitored after triage and treatment in the emergency department, the emergency department itself consisting of 42 private rooms. Mowery said the hospital is currently treating 12 residents and one employee from Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where at least 66 residents have tested positive for the virus and five have died. The idea behind social distancing and shelter in place directives during the coronavirus pandemic has been to “flatten the curve,” or to slow the spread of the virus so as to limit the number of people getting sick at once — and avoid overwhelming the health care system. The intermediate care unit is a step down from critical care, according to Mowery, and has a 24-bed capacity, according to the hospital website. “We can and do add beds if needed to units with capacity,” she wrote. Mowery’s statement was in part a clarification of comments made by County Commissioner Stephen Wantz, R-District 1, at the Tuesday morning budget session, held with all five commissioners speaking remotely via online streaming. In his remarks, Wantz noted that Carroll County had 17 confirmed cases of COVID-19, but that, "This does not include the Pleasant View nursing facility where there are 77 positive cases and about 16 to 20 folks who have been hospitalized. “Another 17 were taken out of that facility and those folks were taken elsewhere, they were not taken to Carroll Hospital as Carroll Hospital center is completely full,” Wantz continued. “They are today looking at gearing up the [hospital’s] Shauck Auditorium for extra beds.” Mowery said the decision to take additional COVID-19 patients to hospitals other than Carroll Hospital was not due to reaching the limits of its capacity — that has not happened, she said. “Carroll Hospital is caring for 12 patients and one employee from Pleasant View Nursing Home, so when additional patients needed to be hospitalized from there the state made the smart decision to disperse the admissions instead of taxing one or two medical centers,” she wrote. As for the possible use of Shauck Auditorium, that is not an active initiative, Mowery said in a phone interview, though it is something they are beginning to discuss in case it is necessary. “We always have an emergency plan in place, but we keep adjusting it as this evolves. That would be our next step if we need to use it and we are mapping it out,” she said. “That’s part of our surge capacity.” The county is also beginning to plan to provide surge capacity in case the number of cases in Carroll County increases rapidly, Wantz said in his remarks during the meeting, suggesting the use of facilities at Carroll County Agriculture Center. “I have instructed emergency management and associated staff to put a request in to the state and federal government to get the Army Corps of Engineers here to set up the Shipley Arena as a surge bed facility,” he said. “It is time to move on that. I think if we get ahead of the game and get on that list we can get some cooperation there.” The Corps of Engineers is currently assessing 341 facilities across the U.S. to possibly convert into temporary emergency hospitals, according to Reuters. As of the afternoon of March 31, the novel coronavirus had resulted in more than 3,400 deaths in the United States out of more than 177,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. County officials have confirmed a total of 94 people have the coronavirus in Carroll County and five have died. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Carroll County health officials open coronavirus hotline, work to coordinate response
.W
Although the coronavirus has not yet spread to Carroll County, local health officials have opened a new hotline for information on the virus and the illness it causes, COVID-19, and are coordinating in preparation for its potential arrival. The Carroll County Health Department launched a new hotline Tuesday morning in response to an increasing number of calls placed to the department’s main phone number concerning the coronavirus. “Our goal is to make sure the public has the information they need to keep themselves and their families healthy and safe,” said Maggie Kunz, health planner for Carroll County Health Department. “We also want to free up our communicable disease staff, who were receiving most of the calls, to prepare to track and manage any potential cases.” As of Tuesday evening, Maryland had nine confirmed cases, according to Gov. Larry Hogan, the cases being in Harford, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties. There have been no cases identified in Carroll County at this point, according to Kunz. “As far as we know, there are no positive cases of COVID-19 in Carroll County," she said. "If we do have a case or cases, we will do our best to make sure our residents have that information as soon as possible. In other efforts to prepare for the coronavirus, LifeBridge Health has announced modified visitor rules at all its hospitals, including Carroll Hospital, Sinai Hospital and Northwest Hospital: No visitors younger than 18 will be allowed in unless they are a parent of a minor patient, only one adult visitor will be allowed at a time, people with flu-like symptoms will not be allowed in, and people cannot visit within 14 days of overseas travel. In addition, tents might soon be installed outside the emergency departments at Carroll, Sinai and Northwest hospitals in what LifeBridge described in a news release as a “proactive measure.” “As part of our COVID-19 planning, our teams recognized that, should there be a widespread outbreak of COVID-19, there could be a need for a large area to screen and triage people who may have this new virus,” the release states. “While we hope that we will not have need for them, having these tents in place will allow our teams to respond more quickly should the need arise.” The hotline can be reached at 410-876-4848 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, according to Kunz, but those calling outside of those hours can leave a message or call the Maryland 211 line. Anyone who lives in Carroll County is welcome to call the hotline to get answers to their specific concerns related to the coronavirus, according to Kunz, but anyone who is having a medical emergency should call 911. “We are getting several calls per day from citizens and health care providers,” she said. “We are working closely with partner agencies and the state health [department] to get information out.” Health department officials will also join Carroll County Emergency Management officials Friday morning to brief people who might be on the front lines of responding to an outbreak in Carroll, such as school and fire officials. That meeting will not be open to the public. The goal is to provide accurate information about the disease and discuss preparedness and planning, according to Emergency Management Manager Valerie Hawkins. The Carroll County Arts Council, meanwhile, issued a statement Tuesday stating that while they are monitoring the situation, upcoming events upcoming concerts, the children’s theater performances of “Seussical Kids,” and the PEEPshow in April have not been cancelled and are expected to take place as planned. Extra efforts are being taken to clean and disinfect the center, and people who have cold or flu-like symptoms are asked to stay home. “We will continue to monitor the situation and are prepared to reevaluate and make decisions based on current recommendations and changing conditions,” Executive Director Judy Morley wrote in a statement. “For now, the show must go on.” The virus and the illness The novel coronavirus 2019 is now technically known as SARS-CoV-2, according to the World Health Organization, and is a new member of a larger family of coronaviruses that includes viruses that cause the common cold and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, first characterized in 2003. The illness caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19, and symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, appearing two to 14 days after exposure. Most cases of the COVID-19 disease are mild, according to CDC, but about 16% of people have a more severe illness that can require hospitalization and even lead to death. Older people and people with underlying health issues are most vulnerable. The novel corononavirus, like colds or influenza, is spread by sneezes and coughs by infected people. And while there is no vaccine — and one won’t likely be available until 2021 — and no specific therapeutics exist, frequent and thorough hand washing, use of hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, covering coughs and staying home when sick can help slow the spread of the disease. More information is available on the Carroll County Health Department’s dedicated COVID-19 webpage, which also notes that there is still more seasonal flu circulating in the U.S. than the novel coronavirus and that it is not too late to get a flu shot. The Maryland Department of Health is also publishing information online at health.maryland.gov/coronavirus.  The first cases of illness associated with the novel coronavirus were reported in December in Wuhan, China. The rapid spread of the disease was alarming enough to public health officials that by Jan. 30 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of “public health emergency of international concern.” As of 4:15 p.m. Tuesday, there were over 118,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease globally, according to a map and dashboard created by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It also reported over 4,200 deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide, while over 64,000 people were reported to have recovered. In the United States, there have been almost 1,000 confirmed cases and 28 deaths, 23 of which were in Washington state.  Hogan has responded by declaring a state of emergency and requiring health insurers to waive fees that could prevent people from getting tested for the COVID-19 disease if they fall ill. Some organizations have also chosen to modify business as usual in response to the outbreak. Towson University, Loyola University of Maryland, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Johns Hopkins University all announced Tuesday they would be cancelling classes at least for the rest of the week. The public can prepare, the local health planner Kunz said, by taking precautions such as hand washing and checking sources of accurate information such as the health department’s COVID-19 webpage, at https://cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/, for updates. “We want people to know that the information is changing daily, but there are things they can do to prepare and prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses,” she said. “We encourage people to prepare, not panic. Everyone can take preventive actions, but people at higher risk (older adults and people with other chronic health conditions) should be most concerned about following public health guidance to prepare for and prevent COVID-19.”

Harford County to receive about $44.5 million in federal coronavirus relief funding
.W
Harford County is expected to receive approximately $44.5 million in federal coronavirus relief from the CARES Act in two installments, County Executive Barry Glassman said Friday. The funding, which will be broken up into two payments, will go toward expenses caused by the coronavirus, but cannot be used to defray revenue lost by counties, a stipulation the National Association of Counties is working to change. Glassman said the first $22.2 million should be arriving in the next week or two, and it will be jointly administrated by county government and the Harford County Health Department. Counties with a population of more than 500,000 people, according to guidance released from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, can apply directly to the treasury for the funds, but counties below that threshold must apply through the states. Harford County’s relief funds will come from the state. Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, along with Baltimore City, are the only Maryland localities that exceed 500,000 residents, according to the treasury. It is worrisome that smaller counties have to go through an extra step to get reimbursement from the health department’s local satellites — some of which are smaller and not as able to comfortably handle such a large sum of money — while larger counties get funding directly, Glassman said on a Wednesday call with Maryland’s Joint COVID-19 Response Legislative Workgroup. “Bureaucratically, it creates a whole extra step for that funding to go to a local health department,” he said on the call. “I’m not sure why our aid did not flow as the other aid flowed directly to local governments ... We are having to jump through an extra hoop and get reimbursement when we really should be getting aid directly to us." The first half of the $44.5 million will be used to pay expenses directly related to the coronavirus — expenditures like buying personal protective equipment, hiring staff, paying for sanitation and purchasing medical supplies, Glassman said. He said the funding could also be used to pay for testing sites. The second round of roughly equivalent federal funds will do much of the same, but Glassman is also hoping for flexibility to give small businesses a bump. The economic considerations, he said, are important for both businesses and the county, both of which have seen a decline in revenues related to the closure of much of Maryland’s businesses — a fact underscored by the state comptroller’s prediction of over $2 billion in lost revenue across the state should the shutdown drag into June. “We cannot go beyond, what, I would say June 1 at the latest,” Glassman said in an interview Friday. "There is a necessity, to some degree, to reopen the economy.” Glassman said Harford County could lose $17 million in income tax alone during that same time period. Critically, none of those federal funds can be used to offset revenue losses for counties themselves, Glassman said. He and the National Association of Counties, which Harford is part of, are pushing for flexibility to offset some of those lost revenues. The funds need to be used by the end of the calendar year, he said. "It is a delicate balancing act, but for us, we think any kind of delay in opening into June will put Harford County and a lot of other counties in a pretty precarious position regarding revenue,” Glassman said. "We understand the use for reimbursement and business assistance and all the other things … but we would like some flexibility, particularly between funds remaining.” While Harford County has enough of a fund balance to weather the shutdown in the short term, Glassman said those federal funds could provide significant help to the county if they could be more flexibly used. NACo’s told counties, Glassman said on the Wednesday call, that Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump were hesitant to give counties latitude to use those relief funds to offset lost revenues. "There is some indication that the President doesn’t want to do that or some Senate Republicans don’t want to do that to put pressure on governors and locals to, in fact, reopen,” Glassman said. "They don’t want to give that right away.” Spokesperson for NACo Brian Namey pointed out that counties provide a multitude of services and that a loss in county revenue could impact those services. For that reason, the organization is working with legislators and the White House to reach an understanding. "We’re optimistic that both sides can come together,” Namey said. “Right now this is a very dynamic situation.”

Gov. Hogan prohibits home foreclosures in Maryland during coronavirus pandemic, extends ban on evictions
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued an order Friday prohibiting foreclosures on homes during the coronavirus pandemic. The order does not relieve borrowers from their obligation to pay back their mortgages, but it does prevent people from losing their homes for the time being. Speaking during a State House news conference in Annapolis, Hogan said that more than 70 mortgage companies, banks, credit unions and other lenders have agreed “to provide additional flexibility to borrowers,” such as 90 days’ worth of deferrals on mortgage payments without late fees. Hogan previously ordered landlords not to evict any residential tenants during the state of emergency due to the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. On Friday, he extended that no-eviction order to cover commercial and industrial properties, as well. He also barred lenders from repossessing cars, trucks or mobile homes, and announced that state agencies would halt all of their attempts at debt collection. “We’re going to continue to do everything we possibly can to help Marylanders get through this,” said Hogan, a Republican. Utilities such as electric, gas, phone and internet services already are prohibited from shutting off service. Hogan also authorized the state’s commissioner of financial regulation to suspend limits on how much money banks can lend customers, in hopes of making it easier for businesses to obtain loans.

Maryland Gov. Hogan announces state budget freeze as coronavirus hammers economy, officials eye $2.8B revenue loss
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Friday that he’s enacting a state budget freeze as the state continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic that has infected nearly 7,000 Marylanders. “The state is immediately instituting a budget freeze on all state spending across all state government agencies,” Hogan said during a news conference at the State House in Annapolis. The state will only spend money on coronavirus-related expenses and payroll, Hogan said. Additionally, the state will institute a hiring freeze and look for possible cuts in the budget. The Republican governor also said he was unlikely to sign into law any bills that require additional future spending. Hogan’s announcement came as the state continued to see an increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths due to the coronavirus. On Friday morning, the state reported that another 33 Marylanders lost their lives to the virus, bringing the state’s number of total deaths to 171. As tempting as it may be to visit family on the Easter weekend, Hogan urged Marylanders to continue following the state’s stay-at-home orders and to observe social distancing when going out for groceries or other essential tasks. “We are ramping up the curve,” he said. “This is going to be one of our most dangerous times ever. … This would be the worst possible time for people to be violating executive orders and congregating.” As warnings continue about the need to slow the spread of the virus, Hogan and other officials are starting to take stock of the financial impact of the pandemic. Hogan’s announcement of budget and hiring freezes came on the heels of predictions from the state’s comptroller that the state could miss out on billions of dollars just in the next three months. In one worst-case scenario developed by the comptroller, the state could lose out on $2.8 billion by the end of June, if the stay-at-home order remains in place that long. If the order extends through May, the hit to the state could be about $1.5 billion. Comptroller Peter Franchot said Friday that the pandemic represents “the most devastating economic catastrophe of our lifetimes.” “This is something that’s going to take years to recover from,” said Franchot, a Democrat, during a virtual news conference on Facebook. The pandemic comes at a difficult time for government budgets. About 44% of the state’s revenue comes in during the final three months of the budget year: April, May and June. “We should plan for the worst and hope for the better,” said Andrew Schaufele, director of revenue estimates for the comptroller. The general fund gets 45% of its money from income tax withholding, so when people lose jobs and face pay cuts, less money comes to the state. More than 240,000 Marylanders have filed for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks — which is more than the state saw during all of 2019. Another 25% of the general fund comes from the sales tax, which has taken a hit with people staying home and buying fewer goods. When the numbers come up short, Maryland has options for balancing its budget. At the start of the pandemic, Maryland had about $1.2 billion in its “rainy day fund.” The Hogan administration already dipped into the fund, and the governor cautioned he may need to use all of it. And the Board of Public Works — comprised of the governor, comptroller and treasurer — can make mid-year budget cuts. Maryland stands to receive billions of dollars in aid from the federal government, but much of that is earmarked for specific components of the coronavirus response and to be sent to local governments — not to fill holes in the state budget created by lost taxes. Lawmakers already approved a budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, but Franchot suggested the entire state budget needs to be “rethought.” Hogan said the pandemic will be costly for years to come and “substantial budget actions” will be needed. “Responding to this crisis will likely create a multi-year budget issue,” he said. Hogan also said he is not likely to support bills that are awaiting his signature that would affect the budget in the future. “It is very unlikely that any bills that require increased spending will be signed into law,” he said. The Democratic-led General Assembly passed a sweeping education bill that requires billions in additional spending on public schools in the coming years, though it inserted a provision to pause the increases if there’s a significant financial downturn. William E. “Brit” Kirwan, a former University of Maryland chancellor who led a commission that championed the legislation, said he remains hopeful the bill might be signed. He said the state’s commitment to the education policies in the bill is more important than the timing of the funding. Lawmakers also passed targeted tax increases on digitally downloaded products, online advertising and tobacco and nicotine products, and they made changes to corporate tax rules to generate more money. Hogan has about one month to determine the fate of those bills. The governor made several other announcements during his Friday afternoon news conference. He announced that the June 2 primary elections will be conducted largely by mail, with limited in-person voting available for people who cannot vote by mail. “In those rare cases where people must vote in person, significant social distancing practices must be implemented,” Hogan said. The state also is encouraging people who have recovered from the coronavirus to join a new “Covid Connect” program to share their experiences and possibly sign up for involvement in research. Fran Phillips, the deputy secretary of health, said more than 400 Marylanders have recovered and are eligible to participate. Phillips said she has spoken to many who have recovered. “What has been so striking is their interest in giving back,” she said. Hogan also said the state is spending $2.5 million to launch a “large-scale” coronavirus testing program with the University of Maryland School of Medicine that could eventually process 20,000 tests per day. He said the state will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up a decontamination site for N95 masks at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport in Linthicum. It will use a decontamination system developed by Battelle, an Ohio-based company. The facility will use a decontamination unit that can “clean and sterilize” up to 80,000 masks per day, Hogan said. “This newly developed technology will allow them to be reused, which will help protect our healthcare workers and those on the front lines, while we await the new production and additional supply of PPE,” Hogan said. Officials also offered updates on efforts to help the sick and the unemployed. Phillips said health “strike teams” have been working with nursing homes to help with coronavirus testing and medical care for residents. Dozens of nursing homes across the state have had outbreaks of the virus, including the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where 81 residents and 31 staff had tested positive as of Thursday. Eighteen residents there have died. The strike teams also have visited homes for medically fragile children to ensure they have appropriate medical equipment and training to handle any coronavirus cases, Phillips said. Tiffany Robinson, the state secretary of labor, said she is working to double the staff of employees who handle claims for unemployment benefits. Many applicants have complained about their phone calls going unanswered and delays in getting their claims filed. “We are all hands on deck to provide Marylanders the support that they need," she said. Hogan became emotional when discussing Sunday’s celebration of Easter. The Christian holiday celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who had died by crucifixion. “Easter really is a day of hope, which is something that all of us could desperately use right now,” Hogan said. “So this weekend, I ask all Marylanders — regardless of their faith — to reflect on that spirit of hope and carry it forward in these difficult days ahead.” The governor did offer one bright note: The Easter bunny, Hogan declared, is an essential employee.

Maryland see boom in health insurance enrollment due to coronavirus, extends special period to sign up
.W
State officials said Wednesday they would extend a special enrollment period to buy health insurance through the Maryland health exchange after about 10,000 people responded to the offer to buy coverage earlier this month as cases of coronavirus began rising. Enrollment has been extended to June 15 on the exchange, created under the federal Affordable Care Act for people who did not get coverage through their jobs. Gov. Larry Hogan has declared a state of emergency as public health officials expect a surge of new cases of the COVID-19 disease in coming weeks. State insurance officials have ordered insurers selling exchange plans to cover the cost of coronavirus testing and offer certain protections and benefits such as allowing consumers to buy extra doses of their medications. Medicaid also is covering testing and so are many private insurers. The federal government declined to reopen enrollment on the federal exchange that serves about three dozen states. The enrollment period in Maryland began March 16, and so far about 85% of those enrolled have qualified for subsidized private plans or Medicaid, the government health program for low-income residents. “We are in a unique situation, and a lot of people across the state are worried about their health and the health of their community," said Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, which administers Maryland Health Connection. "The decision to extend the enrollment deadline was made to ensure as many people as possible get the coverage they need.” Exchange officials said more than half of those who have signed up are young adults age 18 to 34. Before the special enrollment period, about 6% of Marylanders were uninsured, or about 300,000 people. People can enroll at MarylandHealthConnection.gov or call 1-855-642-8572 from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays. There also is a free mobile app called Enroll MHC.

Playgrounds get spray cleaning from owner of Sykesville business amid coronavirus fears
.W
The owner of a local pressure wash company has volunteered to clean parks and playgrounds in and around Carroll County amid concerns about the spreading coronavirus. John Woytowitz, owner of Allbrite Pressure Wash Inc., took to Facebook on Wednesday morning to voice that he wanted to help sanitize local parks. Allbrite Pressure Wash Inc. has offices in Sykesville and Randallstown. Woytowitz said he wants to do this to help protect children from the coronavirus and to prevent it from spreading. “We specialize in an all exterior cleaning as well as restoration work,” he said. “The majority of what we do includes a bleach mixture, which is kind of why we’re extending our services to try to help with the coronavirus outbreak as much as we can because bleach does provide a 100% kill ratio for that bacteria.” Even though he’s still working to coordinate cleaning public playgrounds, Woytowitz was able to get approved to help clean some local private schools Saturday, including St. John Catholic School, Carroll Lutheran School and Little People’s Place. Woytowitz said he wants to help his community after seeing concern among the public over the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease. “The coronavirus outbreak has just kind of been very popular in the news and it’s everybody’s big concern and basically reading the reports and kind of keeping up with everything and seeing that they were trying to use the bleach in China basically to thwart the virus contamination,” he said. As of last week, Woytowitz was still working to find out what approval processes he has to go through to be able to clean playgrounds at public parks and schools. Public schools statewide were ordered closed for two weeks. He said he has been making a variety of calls to county officials at least two hours after making his Facebook post. Woytowitz isn’t looking for employment from the county or any kind of pay but would rather focus on doing this as a donation to benefit his community. “To me, it was like a no-brainer, like how can we do this for the community to help everybody on more of a donated side of things. I’m trying to keep this separate from our residential business because I’m not seeing it as like a marketing feet, it was mainly, ‘Hey, we have the ability to do this, I have the manpower to do it, why not?’ ” After he posted on Facebook asking for contacts with local parks and schools, about 20 people sent him requests for his services at their residences as well. “For as early as it is in the season, just off of that one post, that was very unexpected,” Woytowitz said. “I’m certainly expecting this to generate a little bit more traction for us than if we weren’t going through this pandemic.”

Maryland county asks judge to toss suit over coronavirus in jail
.W
One of Maryland's largest counties on Sunday asked a federal judge to throw out a civil rights group's lawsuit that claims its jail has failed to stop an “uncontrolled” coronavirus outbreak or properly care for infected prisoners. The class-action suit filed Tuesday by Civil Rights Corps claims Prince George’s County Jail prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are isolated in cells with walls covered in feces, mucus and blood. “They are barely monitored and receive no real treatment,” the suit says. The Washington, D.C.-based group’s suit asks the court to order the immediate release of medically vulnerable prisoners. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Greenbelt instructed the county to file a written response to the suit’s claims before she rules. In a court filing Sunday, attorneys for the county said jail officials acted proactively to protect inmates and staff from the virus. Mary Lou McDonough, director of the county’s corrections department, "led the way" among correctional facilities in Maryland to prepare for the COVID-19 pandemic, county officials wrote. The county says the jail's average daily population has dropped from 720 to 560 inmates since March 1, with 18 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the jail population. None of the infected inmates have been hospitalized, and 10 of them have fully recovered and returned to the jail's general population, the county says. McDonough is the only defendant named in the suit. Civil Rights Corps has filed similar suits over conditions at jails in Miami, Dallas, Chicago and Detroit. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and even death.

Our View: Lack of coronavirus testing to blame for unfolding nursing home tragedy in Mount Airy
.W
When the announcement regarding the first two positive tests for the novel coronavirus among Pleasant View Nursing Home residents came nine days ago, the initial hope was that the spread could be contained. When the numbers of residents at the Mount Airy facility testing positive ballooned to 66 the next day and then to 77, the largely unspoken though widely held belief was that perhaps the nursing home had done something wrong or hadn’t done enough to prevent the invasion and spread of COVID-19. And then, mid-week, the first positive tests were announced at Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster. As well as at other elder care facilities throughout Maryland. Gov. Larry Hogan and other state officials said on Friday that coronavirus cases or clusters of cases had been identified in more than 60 nursing homes across the state. It’s now clear that regardless of whether Pleasant View and the rest perfectly followed guidelines and did everything possible to disinfect and to prevent visitors in the weeks leading up to the positive tests, the coronavirus still would llikely have turned up at the facilities. Hogan suggested in a nationally televised Tuesday night interview that a staff member without symptoms likely introduced the virus to Pleasant View and it then spread “like wildfire.” That theory has been advanced by the state’s top health officials. That makes sense and it’s an unavoidable, and tragic, consequence of our nation’s inability to do widespread testing to this point in the coronavirus crisis. Pleasant View Administrator Rebecca Travels told us she was told by the state health department — back before any of her residents had tested positive — that her facility didn’t qualify for testing under the federal government’s criteria. As of Friday night, six Pleasant View residents has died and 24 staff members had tested positive. By Tuesday morning the death toll for residents had risen to 14. At Carroll Lutheran Village, seven residents and two staff members had tested positive through Friday. Nursing homes are particularly high-risk locations for the coronavirus, which is more dangerous for the elderly and those with existing health conditions. There have been significant outbreaks in numerous states, but Pleasant View is the worst since 35 people died following an outbreak at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle. Frances Phillips, Maryland’s deputy secretary for public health services, said there is “clear evidence” that asymptomatic staff are helping the spread. She said the state is now ordering that all workers within nursing homes must wear masks. “It’s important that we smother these nursing homes with infection control,” she said. To be clear, however, just because the vast majority of Carroll cases have been associated with elder care — 110 out of 136 through Friday — doesn’t mean the virus isn’t in the community. Many are walking around without symptoms, not realizing they have the coronavirus and potentially spreading it to anyone they come in contact with. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on NPR this week that perhaps 25% of those infected don’t realize it because their symptoms are mild or nonexistent. Other studies, including one in China, suggest that number could be far higher. Which makes our inability to do widespread testing, and to get quick results, all the more problematic and dangerous. Progress is being made. President Trump was tested last week and had the results in 15 minutes. We hope it won’t be long before the same test is available for every staff member at elder care facilities, to be done before they begin work each day. That could prevent a tragedy such as the one at Pleasant View from repeating itself throughout the state and country, Sadly, had that sort of testing been in place a month ago, perhaps there would’ve been no Pleasant View tragedy.

McDaniel College announces move to online classes after spring break in response to coronavirus
.W
McDaniel College announced Wednesday that all instruction will be moved online for two weeks after spring break out of “an abundance of caution” to prevent spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. The last day of face-to-face classes before spring break will be Friday. Residence halls will close at 5 p.m. on Sunday, and classes will resume — but in an online format — on March 23. McDaniel has no reported cases of COVID-19, according to an email sent to the college community. There are no confirmed cases in Carroll County as of Wednesday evening, according to Maggie Kunz, health planner for Carroll County Health Department. The campus-wide email from McDaniel, a private college in Westminster, said the decision was made “in light of decisions made by the University System of Maryland and our regional peer institutions.” Multiple other universities and colleges in the state have also announced plans for remote instruction. The college said in the message that campus activities, including those related to athletics, could be affected. The college told students to bring all essentials such as medications, as well as all materials needed for coursework, with them when they leave campus for spring break, which is scheduled to run from March 13 to March 22. Students may make requests through the Office of Residence Life at residencelife@mcdaniel.edu or 410-857-2240 if they wish to remain on the campus during or after spring break. Campus offices will be open during the two-week period of remote, online instruction. McDaniel’s off-campus graduate cohorts will continue face-to-face instruction for the time being. Students completing student-teaching internships should continue to follow the guidance given by their home school system. “The McDaniel College Coronavirus Task Force continues to actively review this dynamic and evolving situation. Continue to visit the College’s COVID-19 (Coronavirus) webpage for new information and campus updates,” the campus-wide email stated. A total of 12 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Maryland as of Wednesday night. There have been more than 125,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,600 deaths globally. The college had announced Tuesday that international travel affiliated with the college is prohibited, and anyone who travels on a cruise ship or to a country designated by the State Department Travel Advisory as Level 2, 3, or 4 because of the coronavirus will not be allowed to return to the campus until self-quarantining for 14 days. College officials also discouraged “College-affiliated travel to locations within the United States where states of emergency have been declared related to significant numbers of cases of COVID-19.” More information about travel restrictions and communications is available online at www.mcdaniel.edu/student-life/health-wellness/covid-19-coronavirus-information/covid-19-corona-virus-related-travel. General information about the coronavirus and its effects on McDaniel College is available at https://www.mcdaniel.edu/student-life/health-wellness/covid-19-coronavirus-information. Carroll Community College Carroll Community College President James Ball announced Wednesday in an emailed update to students and staff that the college will hold all classes as scheduled. However, the college has decided to cancel all professional out-of-state travel for employees, until further notice, as of close of business Friday, Ball says in the email. All college-organized out-of-state student trips will be canceled as well. The college is leaving open the possibility that plans for events scheduled for March, April and May could change, and Ball said “any change to an event will be communicated as soon as possible.” College officials are also discussing plans for after spring break, which runs March 22-29, and Ball said he will “provide an update on those matters as decisions are made but at this time all employees should plan for business as usual until further notice.” Anyone who travels to a country designated by the State Department Travel Advisory as Level 2, 3, or 4 because of the coronavirus will not be allowed to return to the campus until self-quarantining for 14 days. In addition, the email states, “If you have traveled to Washington State, California, or New York since February 26th or plan to travel to these highly impacted areas of the U.S., please contact your area Vice President to determine if upon return you should consider self-quarantine for 14 days.” If anyone is told by their health care provider to self-quarantine, Ball urges them to contact a college vice president.

Fewer Carroll County coronavirus deaths as Health Department reclassifies four fatalities
.W
Because of a reclassification of four fatalities, the number of Carroll countians who have died from the coronavirus declined on Wednesday. The Carroll County Health Department announced Wednesday that four fatalities, including one community and three facility fatalities, were reclassified as not being attributable to COVID-19. These individuals will still be counted as positive cases, but not COVID-19 related fatalities. Carroll County has now seen 516 coronavirus cases, a one-day increase of six, and 65 deaths, according to health department data. Three new positive tests bring the total to 289 cases among residents of long-term care facilities or staff members of those facilities who live in Carroll. There have been 60 facility deaths. There were also three new community cases — Carroll countians who are not residents or staff members at long-term care facilities — bringing the number of community cases up to 227 with five deaths. But 13 more people released from isolation, meaning that 107 residents are no longer considered sick (at least 72 hours have passed since recovery and at least seven days have passed since symptoms first occurred). There have been 31 hospitalizations of community members. The health department lists all facilities with active outbreaks and there are currently eight such facilities. Sun Valley Assisted Living in Westminster, which had seen 16 resident cases and fourth deaths, is no longer considered a facility with an active outbreak, meaning at least 14 days have passed since the last outbreak. Brinton Woods Health and Rehab Center at Winfield has seen its first case. The other active facilities are: Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy has seen 84 resident cases with 27 deaths and 42 staff cases (17 of whom live in Carroll, with one death).  Westminster Healthcare Center has seen 62 resident cases with nine deaths and nine staff cases (three Carroll residents).  Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster has seen 39 resident cases with nine deaths and 12 staff cases (10 Carroll residents).  Fairhaven in Sykesville has seen 36 resident cases with eight deaths and eight staff cases (one Carroll resident).  Birch Manor Healthcare Center in Sykesville has seen eight resident cases with two deaths.  Lorien Mount Airy has seen one resident case and five staff cases (two Carroll residents).  Springfield Hospital Center in Sykesville has seen five staff cases (two Carroll residents) Carroll’s 227 community cases include five cases are younger than 10 years old; 10 are in the 10-19 range; 38 are 20-29 years old; 28 are 30-39; 28 are 40-49; 76 are 50-59; 29 are 60-69; five are 70-79; and eight are 80-89. Westminster has the most cases in Carroll, with 214 across two ZIP codes. Mount Airy has 128, followed by Sykesville/Eldersburg with 93, Hampstead with 18, Taneytown with 17, Manchester with 14, Finksburg with 11 and New Windsor with eight. There have been 13 cases in other Carroll ZIP codes. (Data is suppressed in ZIP codes with seven cases or fewer to protect confidentiality.) Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

Officials urge Maryland to hold mail-in only primary because of coronavirus
.W
Maryland’s local election directors are urging the state to move to a mail-in only ballot system for the April 28 primary amid the rapidly evolving coronavirus pandemic. “We are concerned about the potential for exposure of our election judges and voters to coronavirus at polling places on Election Day or at vote centers during early voting,” the local board of elections directors wrote Thursday in a letter to the state board. Given federal health officials’ guidance for people to avoid close contact, the directors “request instead that all voters be mailed an absentee ballot for this election." But during a Friday morning conference call, Baltimore City Elections Board Director Armstead B.C. Jones Sr. said, state officials told them to continue “moving forward as if the election is going to happen as it usually does.” Linda Lamone, state administrator for the Maryland Board of Elections, said she could not comment on whether Maryland was considering postponing its primary. Asked if voting by mail remained an option, Lamone said: “Well, yes, that’s what you all have been reporting for the last two days.” Asked if a decision would be made by the end of the week, Lamone said she didn’t know. Organizing a mail-only election less than seven weeks before the primary would be complicated and expensive. Local directors said a decision needs to be made “now.” “A decision needs to be made within today or by Monday so everyone has a sense of direction on what they need to do to move forward and regroup,” Jones said. “Whatever we are asked to do, we will get it done.” Louisiana became the first state Friday to postpone its primary because of the coronavirus. Earlier this week, Maryland officials, including state Senate President Bill Ferguson, said they were in talks on a mail-in only election, should it become necessary in response to multiple confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s spokesman, Mike Ricci, said the governor has been working with the state elections board on “ways to minimize voter confusion and disruption on primary day.” Hogan has declared a “state of emergency” in Maryland due to the coronavirus. With that in place, state law allows the governor to issue a special proclamation to specify alternate voting locations, specify alternate voting systems or even postpone elections. Jones said he typically relies on hundreds of elderly judges to work the polls — the demographic of people being encouraged to avoid crowds because of their heightened susceptibility to the coronavirus. “I can’t take a chance and open up on Election Day and not have necessary staff to man the polling places,” Jones said Wednesday. Several polling locations in central Maryland are at senior centers. Baltimore voters are scheduled to vote April 28 in the city’s mayoral, City Council president and other races. Across Maryland, voters will pick nominees for president. On the same day, citizens in the 7th Congressional District, which includes parts of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County, will select a replacement for the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Baltimore Democrat. Maryland allows voters to cast absentee ballots without any stated reason, but voting by mail has never been mandatory. Some advocates are concerned about moving to a mail-in only election so close to the primary. “While we are of course deeply concerned about the coronavirus and the need to keep voters safe, we are equally worried that this late action in Maryland — just weeks before the primary — could disrupt voting,” said Page Gardner, founder of the Voter Participation Center in Washington, in a statement. “An abrupt change could end up leaving communities of color and other historically disadvantaged voters on the sidelines of our democracy.” In the competitive and crowded Democratic mayoral primary field, candidates already have changed the way they’re campaigning, with some cancelling fundraisers and door-knocking efforts. Candidates say they are concerned about how COVID-19 could impact the election, though they have different ideas on how the state board should proceed. Former U.S. Treasury official Mary Miller called on Hogan to follow Louisiana’s lead and postpone the primary. “Proceeding with an in-person election on April 28th could cause a decrease in turnout and also pose a serious risk to voters and the backbone of our electoral system, senior poll workers,” she said in a statement. “Proceeding on April 28th without them would cause serious disruptions.” Miller said she’s concerned there’s not enough time to prepare for a mail-in only election, an unprecedented move in Maryland. “Our state could open itself up to widespread voter fraud and also lower turnout due to the confusion and potential lack of communication to historically disadvantaged voters and communities,” she said. Former Mayor Sheila Dixon, running to reclaim her position, does not support pushing the election back. She said that if the state moves to holding a mail-in only primary, the election board would have to do an immense amount of educational outreach and assure people there are safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the election. The 2016 Baltimore primary election, in which Dixon narrowly lost to former Mayor Catherine Pugh, was marred by irregularities. A state investigation concluded that city officials did not handle about 1,650 ballots properly. Dixon has been encouraging seniors to vote absentee this spring, for the sake of their health. Former Baltimore Police spokesman T.J. Smith also opposed any delay. “We don’t know when things will get better,” he said. “We don’t need to disrupt this process any more than it already will be.” Former state Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah said his campaign is ready to “roll with” whatever state officials decide. “We are a local campaign in the middle of a global pandemic,” he said. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young echoed that the city will follow the state’s lead, while City Council President Brandon Scott’s campaign for mayor urged the creation of a “hybrid system” involving expanded early voting and absentee ballot “drop off.”

Baltimore County to open coronavirus testing site in Dundalk on Monday
.W
Baltimore County will be opening a walk up coronavirus testing site at the Dundalk Health Center on Monday, making it first county-operated testing site in Eastern Baltimore County. The new clinic, located at 7700 Dunmanway, will offer 50 slots per day, according to a county news release Friday. As with the county’s three other testing locations, patients must first get authorization from a healthcare provider to be tested. Once authorization is obtained, the person to be tested must schedule an appointment using the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients, known as CRISP. County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. said in a statement that additional testing capacity “is a necessary condition for opening back up." County Health Officer Dr. Gregory Wm. Branch said in the statement that test sites are "a very important tool in our arsenal against this pandemic,” and the county wants to ensure everyone has access to available testing. Residents with authorization will be able to select one of the four test locations. The Dundalk Health Center and the Liberty Family Resource Center will test residents on Mondays, the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium will test on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the Maryland Vehicle Emissions Program facility in Owings Mills will test on Wednesdays and Fridays. Tested individuals will receive post-test instructions at the clinic and most test results will be available within two days. Those coming for testing are asked to adhere to safety guidelines, including wearing face coverings, observing social distancing and following post-test instructions received at the sites. For questions and additional information, call the Baltimore County COVID-19 hotline seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 410-887-3816.

‘It’s all very dystopian’: Maryland resident stuck in Northern Italy describes coronavirus lockdown
.W
From the little Italian town where she arrived to work as an au pair last month, Anne Arundel County resident Kelsey Day has watched on social media as her friends back home have continued to hang out and socialize, even as medical experts issue increasingly dire warnings about the threat of the novel coronavirus. It all seems surreal, she said, given the extreme ways her own life has changed under Italy’s nationwide lockdown. “I’ve tried to tell my friends, it’s not a joke,” said the 22-year-old University of Maryland, Baltimore County student, who had taken the semester off to work and travel. “It’s all very dystopian." As travel restrictions began to ratchet up in the face of the global pandemic, Day is one of many Americans caught overseas in countries ahead of the United States on the exposure timeline — where more drastic measures already have been instituted. “I’m feeling like she’s living a week ahead of us,” said her mother, Leslie Overmyer-Day, a government contractor in management consulting who is teleworking from the family’s Anne Arundel County home and trying not to get too anxious about her daughter’s predicament. In Day’s village of Bezzecca, in the northern Italian state of Trentino, firefighters drive red trucks through the streets a few times a day, playing recorded warnings to stay indoors over loudspeakers, she said. Only one person per household can go to the grocery store at a time, and only once a week, she said. They can’t leave home for anything else. Violators are stopped and fined. “We’ve gotten notices that the hospital can’t even help you if there is an emergency. If you have coronavirus, they are full,” Day said. “If you have some sort of trauma accident, they don’t know if they can accommodate you.” Day and her parents bristle at the lack of assistance from the U.S. government, which they note has urged Americans to return stateside but offered no guidance on how to get there. “I’m very disappointed in our government, that they don’t have some kind of plan together,” said Day’s father, Keller Day, who works in construction. “I realize they can’t send Air Force One to go get people, but I don’t think they have a game plan.” Italy is perhaps the hardest-hit nation in the world, with more than 60,000 cases of the deadly respiratory illness. More than 6,000 people have died in the country. More than 370,000 people have been infected worldwide, including more than 41,000 in the United States. More than 570 people have died in the United States. Some American cities and states have issued stay-at-home orders — including in California, New York and Illinois. In Maryland, gatherings of more than 10 people have been banned, non-essential businesses have been shuttered and officials are urging people to minimize social interactions as much as possible. In the midst of all this, many Americans abroad have sought assistance from the federal government, without much luck. Day says the government has been no help to her. The local consulate has told her she’s on her own. The State Department said Thursday that Americans abroad should get home immediately “unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the federal government is trying to help those in tough spots, standing up a “repatriation task force." But other officials say little is getting done. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat for Maryland, wrote a letter to Pompeo, also on Thursday, saying his office had received “hundreds of urgent inquiries” about constituents in countries across the globe who can’t get home. “In most cases, the Department of State has provided no assistance, or clear guidance, to facilitate their safe travel back to the United States," Van Hollen wrote. He called on the State Department to facilitate emergency flights to repatriate American citizens from countries that have imposed travel restrictions and to provide assistance to others abroad in securing safe accommodations and access to medication. Linda and Danny Ostiguy of Crownsville left for their two-week vacation to Roatan, an island in Honduras popular with snorkelers and scuba divers, on March 7. But because Honduras later ordered its borders closed, their flight home was canceled and rebooked for March 28. But the promise of a flight isn’t bringing much comfort. “I just want to get home,” Linda Ostiguy said. “I’ll be able to see my grandkids.” On Friday the Air Force conducted two flights bringing home 89 people from the mainland in Honduras, according to The Washington Post. Linda Ostiguy said other Americans are in a similar situation on Roatan. “I would hope that they would be trying to send planes here to pick us up,” she said. “That is what the Canadian government has done.” Members of Congress said they have been working with the State Department and embassies to repatriate Marylanders stranded abroad. “Our goal is to get them on a charter or commercial flight as quickly as possible,” said Matthew Verghese, spokesman for Rep. Anthony Brown, who represents the Ostiguys. When Day first took off from the U.S., the coronavirus already existed and was spreading. Her dad was worried about it, but it still seemed like an isolated threat, she said. She was starting an adventure for which she’d saved for years. So she went, spending a few days in London and a week in Bucharest, Romania, before arriving in Bezzecca on Feb. 29, with future plans to work at an olive farm in Greece and then head to Southeast Asia. The coronavirus was already a concern in Italy, and in Bezzecca, but she was told things were settling down and getting better, she said. Schools already had re-opened after being shut. A few days later, however, local authorities re-closed the schools, and “everything went downhill quickly,” she said. She has now been stuck at home for the last few weeks with her hosts — a couple and their 1-year-old son, who sounds sick but hasn’t had a diagnosis. Another family member is going to the grocery store for them. They have some outdoor space, which is nice, but it’s tough to be quarantined with strangers. Day has kept her parents up to speed on everything happening around her — which her mother said helped rouse her out of her own complacency about the outbreak in the U.S. “What I was seeing and hearing and probably was even engaging in a little myself was, ‘It’s no big deal, it’s no big deal, it’s only affecting people who are somehow compromised or are elderly,’” Day-Overmyer said. “But as she was telling me what was happening there on the ground, I was like, ‘This is far worse than we thought it was.’” Her biggest concern now is that her daughter “stays healthy,” she said. She wishes the U.S. government would help get her out, but short of that, it might be best to just “hunker down,” she told her daughter. “The only thing I can rely on is her good judgment, and making the right decisions at the right time,” Day’s father said. “Like I always tell her, keep your head on a swivel.” Day recently bought a plane ticket home for late April out of Rome, after U.S. officials said Americans should secure commercial tickets. But airport closures threaten to make the ticket worthless, and she’s not sure of the logistics of traveling out of her mountainous village by bus or train if the lockdown isn’t lifted, she said. “I have no way to get to Rome if they extend the quarantine,” she said. “I have no idea if the trains are even running.” The Associated Press and Capital Gazette reporter Rachael Pacella contributed to this article.

Maryland secures 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea; Hogan’s initiative sparks criticism from Trump 
.W
Maryland is getting hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests from South Korea, enabling the state to greatly ramp up its testing operation, thanks in part to the efforts of the state’s first lady, Yumi Hogan, Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday. The supplies from LabGenomics, a South Korean company, will enable the state to administer 500,000 tests, according to the Hogan administration. The tests cost the state $9 million — a “worthwhile investment” given how much revenue the state is losing with so many businesses closed, Hogan said. In the latest sign of frustration with the Trump administration, Hogan said his team worked to find and buy the tests in the absence of the federal government providing assistance to the states. “The administration made it clear over and over again they want the states to take the lead and we have to go out and do it ourselves," Hogan said. “So, that’s exactly what we did.” Hogan’s move — negotiating directly with a foreign government — drew the ire of Republican President Donald Trump, who has been seeking to defend his administration’s response to the pandemic while arguing the United States has plenty of testing resources. “The governor of Maryland could’ve called [Vice President] Mike Pence, could’ve saved a lot of money,” Trump said Monday at a news conference while displaying a map of labs in Maryland. “I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a little knowledge.” Hogan has said Trump is not being “straightforward” when the president claims the country has plenty of tests and the governor said the lack of testing supplies caused him to reach out to South Korea for help. Speaking during a news conference outside the governor’s mansion in Annapolis, Hogan described an intense, behind-the-scenes effort to secure the tests. He dubbed it “Operation Enduring Friendship.” The Republican governor started the effort with his Korean-born wife on March 28, when the couple called South Korea’s ambassador to the United States, Lee Soo Hyuck. “We spoke of the special relationship between Maryland an the Republic of Korea and we made a personal plea — in Korean — asking for their assistance," Hogan said. On the morning of the same day, a Saturday, the state health department had reported just under 1,000 cases of the illness. But that night was when Hogan announced a “tragic” outbreak of COVID-19 at Pleasant View Nursing & Rehabilitation in Carroll County with 66 infections and at least one death. Twenty-six people at Pleasant View have now died. The Hogans’ first call led to “22 straight days” of negotiations and vetting that involved scientists and agencies in both countries. Hogan said there were “countless calls” in the middle of the night due to the 13-hour time difference between Maryland and South Korea. “It really was an amazing team effort,” said Hogan, calling the international cooperation “unprecedented.” The Hogans welcomed a Korean Air Boeing 777 plane Saturday to BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport that carried the testing supplies. Hogan said securing the tests represents “an exponential, game-changing step forward on our large-scale testing initiative.” The governor praised several high-level state officials who were part of the negotiations, and singled out his wife. “Most importantly, I want to thank Maryland’s first lady, my wife, Yumi. She truly is a champion of this Operation Enduring Friendship,” Hogan said. Hogan administration officials said they decided to keep the developing operation quiet after Massachusetts reported 3 million masks it ordered were impounded in March at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Hogan was joined at his news conference by Hong Seok-in, the director for public diplomacy for South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whom Hogan thanked in Korean. A Korean flag was behind Hogan’s podium, alongside U.S. and Maryland flags. "The state of Maryland owes an incredible debt of gratitude to the people of South Korea,” Hogan said. Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association, spoke of the state’s strong relationship with South Korea. He said that in February, he and Yumi Hogan arranged for a reception with America’s governors at the South Korean embassy in Washington. “It was a special surprise for us when President Moon [Jae-in] appeared on a video screen to recognize our special partnership," Hogan said. “He said that Korea was so proud of my wife, and that they considered me a 한국 사위, which means a ‘son-in-law’ to the Korean people. I considered it an honor for him to say that, but I had no idea just how much it would truly come to mean these two very long months later.” The ability to administer 500,000 tests represents a dramatic increase in Maryland’s testing capabilities. State health officials have reported the results of 71,397 tests (including 13,684 positives) among a population of about 6 million. Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said the Korean tests would go to priority areas first, such as nursing homes, drive-thru testing centers and health care sites. Maryland officials said Monday the state confirmed 854 more cases of the coronavirus over the previous 24 hours, bringing the state to 13,684 confirmed cases. At least 516 Marylanders have died from COVID-19, and another 66 deaths are suspected to have been caused by the disease. “It will enable us to identify those who are sick and those who have virus," Hogan said. “So, it can help us isolate and do our contact tracing and keep people safe all across the state and help us with reopening.” The governor noted, however, that it will take some time to match the tests with necessary supplies and lab capacity and roll them out. “They don’t have everything that’s needed. It’s a very complex set of things that goes into the testing,” he said. “You need the lab capability, you need the swabs, you need the reagents, and they all have to kind of work together. ... It’s going to take a while to ramp up all of the things that we need to utilize all of the tests.” Maryland secured 40,000 tests last week and sent $2.5 million to the University of Maryland, Baltimore, to help fund a project to use robotics to expand testing there — potentially to 20,000 tests per day. But those steps weren’t enough, Hogan said. Hogan said expanding testing capability is the most critical part of plans to start relaxing restrictions and reopening businesses and the economy. Later this week, Hogan plans to offer more details about the criteria for beginning a gradual reopening process. The other “pillars” of Hogan’s reopening strategy are: expanding hospital capacity to meet a surge of patients, increasing the supply of personal protective equipment, and building the contact tracing operation to track down people exposed to patients with COVID-19. The governor said the state will continue to seek more tests and is researching different types of tests. “It’s a huge step in the right direction. It’s not the end of it, though,” he said. The announcement of state’s move to buy tests in a foreign country was followed promptly by Trump’s criticism of Hogan, which also came after Hogan rejected some of Trump’s claims about testing. On Sunday, Hogan countered messages from Trump and said a lack of supplies for coronavirus tests remains “probably the No. 1 problem in America." On CNN, Hogan said Trump’s claim that states have enough tests to reopen “is just absolutely false." “It’s not accurate to say there’s plenty of testing out there and the governors should just get it done," he said. “That’s just not being straightforward.” On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence sought to soften the Trump administration’s message to governors amid growing clamor from the states for a national strategy to help secure in-demand supplies, such as testing swabs and chemical reagents. Trump said Sunday that he could use the Defense Production Act to compel one company to manufacture swabs. “When it comes to testing, we’re here to help,” Pence told governors during a video conference from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Associated Press obtained audio of the call. Pence said the administration sent an email Monday to officials in each state detailing current testing capacity by state. But Hogan said much of the unused lab machinery listed for Maryland in the report was in federal labs that the state does not have access to. “We already knew where the labs were,” Hogan said. Pence agreed to open federal labs to help states. The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Second RTA driver tests positive for coronavirus; transit system to start daily temperature checks for workers 
.W
A second bus driver with the Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland has tested positive for coronavirus, Howard County confirmed Wednesday. The announcement of the second case comes two weeks after the first case was confirmed by the Howard County Health Department. The driver, who was last at work on March 30, is not a Howard County resident, according to the health department, and drove Route 503 in Howard and Prince George’s counties. The first driver, who is a Howard County resident and was last at work on March 27, has not yet returned to the RTA as of Wednesday, according to Bruce Gartner, head of the county’s Office of Transportation. “The driver used the same bus on his last two shifts over two weeks ago,” Gartner said. “The bus was disinfected from March 27 through April 6, and it was then taken out of service for mechanical repairs and sent to an outside vendor.” Gartner said the RTA will begin offering daily temperature checks and screenings to employees starting “sometime next week,” via volunteer medical staff and equipment. On Wednesday, Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order requiring masks or face coverings for people riding public transportation or inside retail establishments in the state. The order, which will also apply to staff members of those services and businesses, will go into effect at 7 a.m. Saturday. RTA, which primarily services Howard County, also has routes through Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and the city of Laurel. Ridership with the RTA is currently at 20% to 25% of normal levels as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Gartner added. The RTA has been operating on a modified Saturday/Sunday schedule since March 18 because of the pandemic, meaning buses have been running the routes less frequently than usual. As of Wednesday, Gartner said there are no plans to change services or cut routes. The driver is one of more than 10,000 residents statewide who have tested positive for coronavirus as of Wednesday. There are currently at least 424 confirmed cases in Howard County, according to the Maryland Department of Health.

Maryland U.S. Attorney’s office warns residents to be on the lookout for scams, fraud amid coronavirus 
.W
Maryland’s U.S. Attorney is warning residents to be on the lookout for potential scams and scammers, part of an effort to protect people from those trying to profit off the coronavirus. Scams in Maryland and across the country are increasing during the pandemic and target vulnerable people, particularly the elderly, Maryland U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur said in a news release Thursday. One scam outlined as a warning involved fraudsters sending emails claiming to be from a local hospital that offers a coronavirus vaccine for a fee. That entire pitch is a lie, as there are are currently no vaccines for COVID-19. Hur said other fraudsters are offering fake cures for coronavirus and posing as public health officials. He also said there are fake websites that infect users’ computers with harmful malware or seek personal information to be used to commit fraud. “Fraudsters who are preying on citizens during this unprecedented public health crisis are reprehensible," Hur said in the release. “My office and the entire law enforcement community are committed to bringing fraudsters who prey upon our most vulnerable citizens to justice.” He urged residents to “remain vigilant” and be “skeptical” of any unusual calls, emails or website. Hur said U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr sent a memo to U.S. attorneys across the nation to make all scam investigations a priority. Elderly victims may also call the n Elder Fraud Hotline at 833-FRAUD-11 (833-372-8311), if they believe they are victims of a coronavirus scam or any other type of fraud.

Plastics industry using coronavirus to demonize reusable bags | COMMENTARY
.W
The plastics industry has exploited fear around COVID-19 to sell more single-use plastic. In recent weeks, it activated a multimillion dollar echo chamber that is straight out of the fossil fuel industry’s playbook, and involves many of the same fossil-funded corporate front groups that tout industry-funded research and help publish alarmist media coverage. The same actors have been doing this for years to deny climate science, and now they have turned their attention toward halting the progress of reusable bags, and saw a pandemic as their opportunity to do so. It is shameful. The plastic industry’s propaganda effort, that says reusable bags can contribute to the spread of COVID-19, ignores the fact that the current research we have shows that the virus could live on plastic surfaces longer than others in our grocery stores. New research from the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UCLA and Princeton University reveals that SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can live on plastic surfaces for as long as two to three days. The study also shows that standard disinfecting and cleaning procedures can inactivate the virus. This new study clearly made the plastic industry nervous. Rather than allow people to focus on all of the plastic surfaces to avoid throughout a grocery store, the industry went on offense to create a narrative meant to scare people from using reusable bags. This exploitative attack was meant to help boost industry profits in a time of crisis. Their notion of plastic surfaces being “clean and safe” was in danger, so by demonizing reusables, they are working to convince people that consumers are too dumb to clean their own bags or bag their own groceries. Single-use plastics — the often unnecessary packaging and bags that we use once and toss into a bin — threaten people’s health, our environment and our communities. That is why communities have been fighting back against the plastics industry. That is why bag bans and plastic reduction efforts have exploded in recent years. In the middle of a pandemic, those threats do not go away. As communities on the front lines near plastics refineries face elevated risks from harmful chemicals and increased health concerns, it is incumbent upon all of us to stand up to exploitative industries that try to profit from a global health crisis. Numerous medical professionals have now weighed in to say that reusable bags can be utilized safely, but that we should be smart about it — as we need to be with any human interaction at the moment. That means cleaning and disinfecting the surfaces to ensure that germs are not present, and bagging our own groceries rather than having a store clerk do it. And when we get home, the best available advice is to wash and disinfect the surface of anything we have purchased at the store to ensure it is sanitary. It is sad that industry opportunists have seen this pandemic as a moment to spread fear and misinformation. Several cities and states have temporarily reversed course on their plastic bag bans following industry pressure. It is absolutely understandable for governments to be operating with an abundance of caution right now, but the reality is that reusable bags pose no greater risk than any plastic surface in a supermarket — or any other personal belonging that we carry into a store. As long as we take every precaution to maintain a safe distance from store employees and keep our bags away from others, reusable programs should be allowed to continue. Beyond the pandemic, businesses and governments should continue to work together to ensure reusable systems instill confidence in the safety of workers and shoppers alike. In this current crisis, people need factual medical research, not public relations from the plastics industry. If the plastics industry cared so much about people’s health, it would be mobilizing alongside legislators to get more ventilators and masks to our hospitals, not fighting reusable bags. Now is not the time for industry games. Perry Wheeler (perry.wheeler@greenpeace.org) is a communications specialist for Greenpeace USA working to expose industry exploitation of COVID-19. He is based in Baltimore.

Maryland confirms 28 new cases of coronavirus, now at least 85 total
.W
Maryland officials have confirmed 28 new cases of the coronavirus since Tuesday as the state continues to implement emergency measures to try to stem the spread of the disease. Kata Hall, spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan, wrote that the state has now confirmed at least 85 cases of COVID-19, the virus more commonly known as the coronavirus. Montgomery and Prince George’s County saw six new confirmed cases each. Combined, the two counties have accounted for more than half the state’s number of confirmed cases at 51 total. The majority of new confirmed infections, 23, were found in people aged 19 to 64 years of age, Hall wrote. Five people aged 65 years or older were confirmed infected since Tuesday. The virus, which has accounted for thousands of deaths worldwide, is said to be more fatal to seniors and those with compromised immune systems. The state updates the number of cases confirmed each day at 10 a.m. while counties and local jurisdictions may announce cases separate of those confirmed by the state. On Tuesday, Gov. Hogan postponed the state’s April 28 primary election to June 2 and announced a set of new emergency orders to transition emissions inspections sites to drive-thru coronavirus testing sites and to reduce MARC and BWI traffic.

Dentist and record store owner Dr. Anton Grobani dies from coronavirus
.W
The contrast between Dr. Anton Grobani’s two careers often took people by surprise. The day after Keith Moon died, the Annapolis dentist took out the 1975 record “Two Sides of the Moon” and put it on prominent display in his record shop. “Dr. Grobani would not be the first guess as the sort of person to pay homage to a member of the band that regularly smashed its equipment at the end of performances," a Sun writer remarked in 1978. A father of five, Dr. Grobani was a dentist by trade as well as a music lover who ran record stores in Maryland and Virginia. A longtime baseball fan, he wrote a book on the sport some refer to as “The Grobani Bible.” His friends call him a “Renaissance Mensch.” Dr. Grobani died April 15 in Baltimore of complications from the coronavirus. He contracted the virus while a patient at Levindale’s subacute rehabilitation center, owned by LifeBridge Health. The 87-year-old was one of multiple patients in the unit to test positive for COVID-19. His wife and two daughters chose to care for him at home in his final days rather than risk having him die alone at the hospital, said his daughter, Abby Grobani. “Ultimately we were just very alone with him,” Ms. Grobani said. They remain in quarantine days after his death. Born in Philadelphia in 1932, Dr. Grobani moved to Baltimore with his family at age 9. His father, a Russian-born opera singer named Benjamin Grobani, worked as a cantor at Oheb Shalom in Baltimore. “A lot of people of a certain age were tutored for their bar or bat mitzvah by him," recalled Ms. Grobani. His mother, Pauline Grobani, was a pianist. As a boy, he dreamed of becoming a baseball announcer, but his father urged him to do something more practical. After graduating from City College in 1949, Dr. Grobani headed to the University of Maryland, where he received his undergraduate degree before attending the school of dentistry there. He would spend two years in the Air Force. Though he left Philadelphia at age 9, Dr. Grobani remained a lifelong Phillies fan and wrote bibliographies of football and baseball literature. His 1975 ″Guide to Baseball Literature" is a household name among baseball literature fans, according to his daughter. “People refer to them as ‘The Grobani Bible,’” Ms. Grobani said. His passion for music shaped his life. In addition to the record stores he owned, for several years he hosted a weekly radio show at the University of Maryland’s college radio station. One Sunday, while courting his future wife, the violinist Sally Weintraub, he dedicated a three-hour episode to her, calling it “The Sally Show.” Confused listeners called in to ask who “Sally” was. The couple married in 1985. Together they had two daughters, Neely and Abby. In addition, Dr. Grobani had three sons, Daniel, David and Jonathan, from a previous marriage. Dr. Grobani’s career as a record shop owner began in the 1970s, when he purchased The Record Exchange in Annapolis. He later branched out to shops in College Park, Bowie and Fairfax. On Facebook, former employees remembered at first writing him off as a grouchy old man, only later discovering his vast knowledge of and appreciation for music. One former employee remembered how he drove a vintage car with a license plate, “Cpl593h.” It was a reference to a song by Roxy Music, one of his favorite bands. “I remember being really young, in my late teens or early 20s, and just thinking, ‘Wow, that old man is cooler than I ever will be,’ ” the employee wrote. At home, Dr. Grobani kept thousands of records, organizing them by genre and then alphabetically. “He always, always, always said that records would make a comeback,” Ms. Grobani said. It was with great reluctance that he began carrying cassette tapes and, later, CDs in stores. Dr. Grobani’s broad appreciation for music extended to his family. He attended each of his wife’s violin performances, whether at the symphony or a local church, and chaperoned his daughters to concerts and on multiple trips to Hot Topic during Ms. Grobani’s goth phase. In Annapolis, Dr. Grobani founded the city’s first conservative Jewish congregation, Kol Ami. At various stages of life he returned to his work as a dentist to support his family. He owned dental practices in Annapolis and then later in Dundalk, where he strove to make dental care affordable to all. “He retired from dentistry officially three times,” Ms. Grobani said. The last time was in 2015, when Dr. Grobani was 82. He was a quiet, unassuming man at social gatherings. “He would be laughing more than he was talking,” Ms. Grobani said. But his laugh made his presence known: it was loud, booming, and went on and on. Before he died, Ms. Grobani called her father at Levindale’s subacute rehabilitation center, where he was being treated for Parkinson’s. “As a joke I asked him if he had made any friends. And he burst out laughing for over a minute. He appreciated any sort of good humor." It was during that stay that he contracted the coronavirus. Dr. Grobani was tested as he was being discharged. His family believed that it was a formality; medical staff told them there was only a slight chance he actually had it. It wasn’t until after Dr. Grobani had returned home that his family learned that he had the virus. At home, Dr. Grobani developed psychosis and hallucinations before slipping into a coma. His family members, dressed in protective gear, administered morphine at three-hour intervals to ensure he was comfortable. They cooled him down if he had a fever. Ms. Grobani said, “We had a lot of time to be able to talk to him and to slowly come to terms with what was happening.” As he died, they read from the Haggadah for Passover and played some of his favorite music — Bach, the Beatles, and, of course, Roxy Music. The family hosted a shiva via Zoom. In addition to his wife and children, Dr. Grobani is survived by his sister, Nina Davis, formerly of Baltimore, three grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

Don’t need your coronavirus stimulus check? Give it to the Maryland Food Bank | COMMENTARY
.W
As a thank you to customers, Latino grocery chain Megamart planned to sponsor a half-million-dollar, two-hour, food-giveaway promotion Friday at its Maryland and Virginia stores in the D.C. suburbs, handing out staples including rice and milk. But store owners were instantly overwhelmed, with thousands of people crowding into queues in multiple locations, risking coronavirus infection as they tried to ward off another threat: hunger. News coverage of the event showed lines that were hundreds of people deep — a stark snapshot of our country’s mounting hardship. “I don’t want to come out, because I worry. I take care of my life … but I need food,” Anarel Mejia, an out of work cashier, told one news station. “That’s why I'm here, because now I think everybody needs help." In the past month, 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment, with most losing jobs because of COVID-19 related shutdowns. In Maryland, more people filed jobless claims in the past four weeks — nearly 300,000 — than in all of 2019. Others are barely getting by on reduced business or employer-mandated pay cuts. That’s sent the demand for food soaring. At the Maryland Food Bank, which distributes groceries at 1,200 sites with the help of 350 partners, demand was up 50% in March, and it had doubled by the first two weeks of April, with the organization handing out roughly 2.2 million pounds of food compared to about a million pounds during the same period a year earlier. At the same time, food donations are down about 90%, which means the food bank has had to purchase most of the food it distributes amid rising prices, as the country’s supply chain is stretched thin and others stockpile goods. In the past month, the Maryland Food Bank has spent $2.6 million on food, compared to $220,000 in a typical month. CEO Carmen Del Guercio estimates they’ll need to raise $12 million just to get through the next 90 days. “Food banks are built to respond to crises like this, but this one is beyond anybody’s expectations.” Mr. Del Guercio said in an interview. Dollar donations have been steady at food banks throughout the country, including in Maryland, but the contributions can’t keep up with the skyrocketing need. Cars are lining up several miles long at collection points in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A San Antonio, Texas, food bank has warned it may have to ration resources. And in Cleveland, Ohio, one food bank expects to be 26% over budget by September and has had to stop buying peanut butter amid price increases. The Maryland Food Bank has had to change its model to fit the circumstances — and stay safe. Instead of allowing families to select goods as they typically do, the organization has begun prepackaging food in boxes for pickup to minimize the interaction with customers and speed up collection. The available food selection has dwindled, anyway, as more people compete for fewer goods, and social distancing requirements have shrunk the number of volunteer positions able to hand out goods. The last time the Maryland Food Bank was significantly stretched was during the monthlong government shutdown that lasted from December 2018 into January of 2019. But that was a slow ramp-up, Mr. Del Guercio said, whereas “this happened immediately.” What’s more, he always knew an end was around the corner. “The challenge here is that we can’t see where the end game is,” he said. Behind health care, food is arguably the biggest need in communities right now. Those who can afford it should make every effort to support distribution centers — perhaps with those federal government stimulus checks many are getting. You can deliver food donations to the Maryland Food Bank’s Halethorpe location (2200 Halethorpe Farms Rd.), though cash will go a lot further; the food bank has greater purchasing power than individual shoppers. Donation information is available online at mdfoodbank.org or by calling (410) 737-8282. And while coronavirus has got your attention, may we suggest you make that donation recurring. Nearly 240,000 households in Maryland are food insecure even without a pandemic. The Baltimore Sun editorial board — made up of Opinion Editor Tricia Bishop, Deputy Editor Andrea K.

Pandemic playbook: Social distancing amid coronavirus leads to new coping behaviors | COMMENTARY
.W
After several weeks of coronavirus-inspired social distancing, we all have had to adapt our behaviors and learn to cope in different ways amid this “new normal,” even if the disease hasn’t yet directly hit home for us. Here’s a look at some of the societal shifts and trends — from the silly to the sorrowful — we’re seeing thus far: Coronavirus choreography: That avoidance dance we do to stay at least 6 feet apart while taking a walk and another person comes along from the opposite direction. Coronavirus Chromebook: The low-cost laptop parents with the means are scrambling to buy their kids for online learning as schools go virtual. Coronavirus classrooms: Anywhere a creative guardian can find: the kitchen (culinary arts), laundromat (home economics.), yard (landscape design), dining table (worksheet work zone/laptop library), etc. Coronavirus close crop: The long-lasting buzz cut and brush cut parents are now giving boys when their hair needs a trim and the barbershops are closed. Coronavirus colleagues: Everyone else in our homes while we’re trying to telework, including: children, spouses, significant others, roommates, pets. COVID-19 (the other one): The pounds we’re all likely to put on from stress snacking (worse than the freshman 15). COVID conference call: The group work meeting we now conduct in our nightclothes or while walking the dog. COVID confusion: The feeling we get when seasonal allergies kick in, but we’re worried it’s really the virus, finally coming for us. COVID craving: The overwhelming desire for anything and everything we can’t get during this pandemic — from a meal at our favorite restaurant to our preferred brand of toilet paper. Pandemic pajamas: The comfiest lounge-wear we’ve got, worn two to five days per week. Washing optional. Pandemic panic: The fear we feel when we realize we’re out of something we consider essential and might have to venture out to replace it. Pandemic party: Playing a game or sharing a drink with friends or extended family using a video calling or conferencing app. Pandemic pet: The animals we’re fostering (and falling for) because the shelters have had to shut down. Pandemic pity party: The significant sorrow still healthy people feel over our lost opportunities and canceled experiences — proms, trips, job changes, anniversary dinners, weddings, and so on — even as we’re grateful for our lives. Pandemic play date: Our youngest children talking too loudly to other kids on FaceTime/Zoom/Facebook Messenger, etc.; possibly singing/dancing/screeching. Pandemic ponytail: Women are turning to this universal style after too much time away from the hairdresser. Pandemic postcards: An attempt to keep kids connected with one another and writing while they’re out of school. Pandemic puzzle: The partially done jigsaw we’ve had for years (there’s a shortage of new ones) spread out wherever we can find the space, along with the guilt of still not finishing it. Social distancing date night: Dressing for dinner and eating in the dining room with our significant others. “Dressing” could mean a suit and tie, or anything other than sweatpants. Social distancing depression: The malaise none of us can quite shake as we face an uncertain future. Social distancing diet: Breakfast; morning snack; lunch; early afternoon snack; late afternoon snack; dinner; dessert; late-night snack. Social distancing dye job: The inexplicable pull many are feeling to dye their own hair, or their family member’s, bright colors for something to do. Social distancing salutation: The urge we have to greet every person we pass while walking to acknowledge that, though apart, we’re all in this together. Virus vacation: When we still take off from work the dates of a planned, and since canceled, vacation and use the time to organize our homes and do other chores. Virus video conference: The meeting we now conduct in a work shirt (in view of the camera) and yoga/sweat pants (not), while trying to avoid looking at our own image. Possible proof of the former: Walmart says people are buying more shirts now, but not pants. The Baltimore Sun editorial board — made up of Opinion Editor Tricia Bishop, Deputy Editor Andrea K.

Maryland congressional delegation: State’s HBCUs will get more than $44M in additional aid during coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Maryland congressional delegation announced Tuesday that more than $46 million in additional funding is being released to mostly historically black colleges and universities to help relieve the financial strain that the coronavirus left on institutions. The delegation, which included U.S. Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, said $44 million will go to HBCUs. The remaining $2 million will be awarded to minority-serving institutions and colleges serving large populations of low-income students. Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Andy Harris, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone also helped with the funding. The additional aid will supplement the previous $170 million many of these universities and colleges received, the delegation said in a news release. Morgan State University is receiving over $19 million and Bowie State University nearly $13 million. The University of Maryland Eastern Shore and Coppin State University are also receiving about $8 million and $4 million, respectively. Nine community colleges are receiving a little over $1 million, and there is about $600,000 for public and private nonprofit schools. “Maryland’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, and community colleges serving high populations of low-income students play a critically important role in our communities,” the delegation said in the release. “We fought to obtain dedicated assistance to ensure that they have the resources to make it through this challenging time. This federal funding will help these institutions continue to educate and serve the needs of their students.” Congress set aside more than $1 billion out of the entire $14.25 billion higher education relief funding through the CARES Act for HBCUs and MSIs, the release said. Schools can use the funding to help cover attendance costs for students, technology and faculty and staff training. It can also help cover operational costs including lost revenue, reimbursements for prior expenses and payroll.

Gov. Larry Hogan has declared a statewide “moment of prayer and reflection” at noon today to honor the people who have died from COVID-19, commonly known as the coronavirus, as well as the medical workers and first responders tackling the ongoing outbreak. In a proclamation signed by the governor, the moment of silence is “to reflect in unity and prayer for the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic and for those risking their lives to care and provide for others.” “Maryland unites in solemn respect and gratitude to pay homage to those who so courageously continue to do all that is within their power to heal and support our nation during this pandemic,” the proclamation reads. As of Sunday morning, at least 67 people have died from the disease in Maryland and at least 3,609 cases of the virus have been confirmed, according to state officials.

Baltimore County is hosting a virtual coronavirus town hall Thursday night. Here’s how residents can participate.
.W
Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. and other county officials are hosting a virtual town hall Thursday evening to provide updates on the county’s coronavirus response. The meeting can be streamed online on YouTube at 6 p.m. April 2, or residents can dial in at 833-946-1803. Community members also can submit questions online now before the hearing starts by emailing townhall@baltimorecountymd.gov, or ask questions during the town hall through YouTube’s Live Chat feature. Questions will be monitored by county staff, county spokesman Sean Naron said. Olszewski will be joined by Baltimore County Health Officer Dr. Gregory Wm. Branch, Baltimore County Public Schools Superintendent Darryl L. Williams, Police Chief Melissa Hyatt, Fire Chief Joanne Runde and representatives from the Department of Public Works and Department of Recreation and Parks. Officials will review actions taken by county government and the latest departmental information in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Naron said. Baltimore County, Maryland’s third most populous county, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases in the state, with 353 reported cases as of Thursday afternoon. Olszewski’s administration most recently launched a COVID-19 emergency response fund to support residential and governmental needs. The county has suspended evictions and halted water service shutoff during the local state of emergency and has set up food distribution sites throughout the county. All county licenses, permits and registrations have been extended until 30 days following the end of the local state of emergency. Olszewski also has canceled or postponed all non-essential meetings of public boards, commissions or committees, and is prohibiting members of the public from attending meetings deemed essential, or from entering past the lobbies of buildings with the Towson governmental complex. With the remaining budget town hall meetings canceled, a virtual budget hearing has been scheduled for 6 p.m. Tuesday, April 7. The Baltimore County Planning Board is now collecting feedback on rezoning issues in the county’s Comprehensive Zoning Map Process online. A livestream meeting of the Planning Board is scheduled for April 21.

5 key points from Maryland Gov. Hogan’s Friday interviews on the coronavirus pandemic
.W
Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan has been a guest on many TV and radio shows, spreading a message that Marylanders need to take the virus seriously and stay at home. Friday morning was another rapid tour of the airwaves for Hogan as he appeared on four radio shows ― Mix 106.5, WTOP, Hot 99.5 and 98 Rock ― within an hour. Here are five key points the governor made: Younger people make up a majority of cases in Maryland The state released more detailed age data for confirmed coronavirus cases Friday, showing 54% of those infected in Maryland are under the age of 50. About as many people in their 20s are infected as people in their 60s, the data show. Hogan warned younger Marylanders not to believe they’re “bullet-proof.” “At first we were talking this thing affecting older people,” Hogan said. “That’s completely false. ... Most of our cases are actually younger people.” Pass-fail school? With public schools closed for another month in Maryland, the governor said school officials are pushing ahead with a more robust remote-learning plan that includes getting work packets and “laptops out to as many kids as possible.” He said school districts might consider shifting to a pass-fail grading system for the final quarter of the year. “They’re going to try to continue the school year without the buildings being opened,” Hogan said. “Maybe pass-fail for the end of the year? Nobody knows when this is going to end.” But the governor was clear about one thing: “We can’t be sending kids back into school if they’re going to be getting sick and dying.” Police patrolling state parks The governor said that Natural Resources Police and park rangers are patrolling the state’s parks, breaking up any large groups congregating. Hogan said he wants to keep parks open for solo or small group exercise. “Go for a jog or a go for a run,” the governor said. “It’s probably not too bad for two people to play tennis on a tennis court with plenty of distance.” But larger gatherings? “We want to hear about those," he said. “The Natural Resources Police and the park rangers are shutting down any kind of activity.” Emissions drive-thru testing stations are ‘close’ to ready, once the tests are Hogan said the state has converted its vehicle emission testing stations into drive-thru testing stations for the coronavirus. The personnel and equipment are in place, but testing capacity isn’t yet. “We’re getting very close,” Hogan said. “All the stations are ready to open. .... We’ve got the guard. We’ve got the health care workers. We’re just waiting for all of the tests. We don’t want to open up a bunch of facilities and have people come through and have a huge backup with no ability to do the lab work.” On being a cancer-survivor during the pandemic In response to an interviewer’s questions about Hogan’s health, the governor said he’s taking the same steps as other Marylanders, such as washing his hands regularly and staying away from others, to try to prevent getting the coronavirus. Hogan is 63 and a cancer survivor, meaning he is part of an at-risk group for the virus. “I’m over 60 and have a compromised health system,” Hogan said. “I’m working 20 hours a day.” The postponement of Orioles Opening Day at Oriole Park at Camden Yards helps him avoid the politician’s impulse to shake hands, he noted. “Every year I’m out shaking 5,000 hands,” Hogan said, before joking: “The good news is yesterday was Opening Day and the Orioles did not lose a game.”

Baltimore County expecting multimillion-dollar drop in revenue and rise in expenses due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. says his administration projects that the county’s local revenues will drop by “tens of millions of dollars” next year as businesses suspend operations and furlough or lay off workers during the coronavirus pandemic. Adding to the problem, Olszewski said, expenses directly tied to COVID-19 also will amount to “tens of millions” of dollars. Olszewski addressed budget projections during a virtual town hall Tuesday night, saying the county is “in uncharted territory.” The Democrat said the county will have to focus on the “basics” to ensure residents continue to receive the essential public services required to “weather this storm.” “We will have to make some difficult decisions, but I remain optimistic that the steps we have taken to date and those we will continue to take will allow us to remain focused on our priorities while we manage our way through this crisis together,” Olszewski said. Providing resources to schools, public safety and the workforce are the county’s three budget priorities for 2021, Olszewski said. Some members of the County Council who were present voiced support for the tighter budget. Councilman David Marks, citing a briefing from the county’s Economic Advisory Committee, said COVID-19 will create “a very short and vicious recession,” forcing county government to make “some very difficult decisions in the short term.” “This will be a budget cycle different than any other in my nine years on the council,” Marks said. “We’ll need to focus on the fundamentals of local government, including public safety, education, transportation and infrastructure, and caring for our most vulnerable citizens.” The county’s ability to take on “particularly large projects,” such as repairs to county drainage, will be “constrained at least in the short term,” Olszewski said. Councilman Tom Quirk, an Oella Democrat, sought to assure residents nonetheless that the county will look into flooding problems and ways to address them in the future. Olszewski said he’s planning to follow up with the county’s state lawmakers to figure out the long-term prospects of the massive public schools overhaul recommended by the Kirwan Commission. He also said he remains “fully committed” to working on the county’s school needs, including a 10-year plan to address overcrowding. Additionally, Olszewski said, he’s worked with the county to put forward the funding to provide air conditioning in high schools by next year. Marks, a Perry Hall Republican, said those projects will positively affect the county during the economic decline. Maryland’s confirmed number of coronavirus cases exceeds 4,000 and on Tuesday the state’s cumulative death toll from the pandemic topped 100. Public services have been restricted and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has closed nonessential businesses. Hogan also issued a stay-at-home order in an effort to reduce gatherings. Those actions were taken to slow the spread of infections that could overwhelm Maryland’s health care system, county health department director Dr. Gregory Branch said. As a result of the economic slowdown, 13,000 county residents last week filed unemployment claims, said Will Anderson, director of the county’s Department of Economic and Workforce. He said he expects that number to increase. Tourism also is expected to take "a major punch” due to the pandemic, Anderson said. Hotels and restaurants could see drops in revenue this year, but Anderson said the county is developing “an aggressive plan” to support the tourism industry. The pandemic is also driving an increase in trash from residents who are staying at home, Olszewski said. The county’s waste drop-off facilities are closed to the public, but they will remain open for commercial haulers. Likewise, the county has suspended the curbside pickup of yard waste until further notice so collectors can focus on trash collection. The county’s adjusted budget proposal could affect the “small” backlog of road-resurfacing projects, Olszewski said. Those projects create jobs, but Olszewski stressed the county has to first focus on keeping “the core of our government services intact.” Meanwhile, the county is planning to rely largely upon a $1.65 million federal grant to develop the Towson Circulator, a free bus that would connect downtown areas, Olszewski said. Marks said the county is also reaching out to the community for assistance. The County Council on Monday night passed several emergency bills in an effort to help the county fund its pandemic response. Olszewski’s administration created a “COVID-19 Donations Gifts and Grants Fund program” to complement its “COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund.” The donations program will let donors provide up to $500,000 to address pandemic response expenses. The council also passed the Olszewski administration’s request to approve supplemental appropriations of $3.5 million in federal funds and $3.5 million in state funds for the new coronavirus donation program. The combined funds will be used to reimburse the county’s COVID-19 expenses. Olszewski is scheduled to present his administration’s 2021 budget proposal to the council next Tuesday.

Unemployment filings skyrocket in Carroll County in sign of economic damage from coronavirus
.W
Unemployment claims in Maryland saw a record-breaking surge in the latest data release this week, and Carroll County was not exempt from this latest indicator of the economic damage caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Carroll saw 2,685 claims for unemployment insurance in the week that ended March 28, more than double the previous week’s 1,158 claims, according to the state Department of Labor. For comparison, 31 people in Carroll filed unemployment insurance claims the first week of March. Denise Rickell, manager at the Carroll County Business/Employment Resource Center, or BERC, said they have received some calls from locals asking for advice for how to get through the overwhelmed process to file. She said there isn’t much to say except acknowledging that the wait times are long and to “keep trying, keep trying.” Many people applying for unemployment are expecting to return to their previous employer when businesses re-open, she said. Industries hiring right now are those deemed essential, such as delivery drivers and those working at grocery stores, home improvement stores and health care facilities. Gov. Larry Hogan has ordered all Maryland residents to stay at home, with limited exceptions for “essential” business, in order to limit the spread of the coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 disease it causes. BERC closed its in-person offices, but staff are returning phone calls and offering information through BERC’s website, carrollworks.com, and Facebook page, www.facebook.com/CCBERC. “We’re furiously working to get a lot of resources set up online,” she said, including the Monday job club and finding ways to move workshops to video. Working remotely is a challenge when the BERC team is used to working face-to-face, Rickell said, but she hopes it will make them more flexible and creative even after the threat of the coronavirus has passed. Mike McMullin, president of the Carroll County Chamber of Commerce, said it’s a crazy time in the business world, and “I don’t think anybody is surprised that unemployment numbers have jumped as high as they have." The Chamber is working to post resources online for the business community at large. He also highlighted resources at the Small Business Development Center, whose webinars have been getting as many as 500 participants. On April 1, the Department of Labor extended hours at Unemployment Insurance Claim Centers, which now are open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday. Overall, 84,230 Marylanders filed for unemployment either over the phone, online or by mail during the week ending March 28, up from 42,334 residents the week before. They were among more than 6.6 million Americans who filed jobless claims last week. That brings the total of unemployed Americans to about 10 million since the coronavirus outbreak began. Tiffany Robinson, the state’s labor secretary, said Wednesday on a conference call with state lawmakers that the department typically processes about 2,000 claims per week. Some filers have experienced delays and problems because of the overwhelming demand on the system. With the increased number of filings, the department asked Marylanders to consider filing online, through mdunemployment.com. Early in the morning or late in the evening had faster speeds, they said, though the paperwork is available 24/7. The state Department of Labor is encouraging those who have lost their jobs to stagger when they call or go online to request assistance, with last names A through F filing on Mondays, last names G through N filing on Tuesdays and last names O through Z filing on Wednesdays, then any names on Thursday and Friday. Robinson said Marylanders will be helped whenever they call, but she hoped the voluntary system could help spread out the work. Residents who typically work full time or part time are eligible for unemployment. Under state and federal legislation passed to address losses during the pandemic, benefits are now also available to some people who have not been formally laid off or work in “gig economy” jobs if they have lost work because of coronavirus-related closures or slumps in demand. Robinson asked representatives to reassure their constituents that “benefits will be paid, back through the time they were separated from employment,” Robinson said. “Just because they can’t get through now, or they’re having trouble now, doesn’t mean that they’re not going to get their benefits.” Baltimore County had the largest number of overall unemployment claims in Maryland, with 13,352 reported claims, according to the department. Worchester County, which is the home of summer tourist destination Ocean City, saw the most concentrated of claims by population, with 45 people per 1,000 unemployed. The unemployment rate, which is reported on a monthly basis, could spike to as high as 15% nationally in March, above the previous record of 10.8% set during a deep recession in 1982. A list of frequently asked questions about COVID-19 and Maryland’s Unemployment Insurance Benefits Administration is available at http://labor.maryland.gov/employment/uicovidfaqs.shtml. Baltimore Sun reporters Scott Dance, Pamela Wood and Phil Davis, plus The Associated Press, contributed to this article.

Maryland-based company partners with Johnson & Johnson to help create coronavirus vaccine in Baltimore facility
.W
A Maryland company announced Thursday that it’s partnering with Johnson & Johnson to help support the creation of a coronavirus vaccine at a facility in Baltimore. Gaithersburg-based Emergent BioSolutions Inc. said in a news release that under the $135 million deal, it will provide drug substance manufacturing services along with contract development to help Johnson & Johnson achieve the goal of creating 1 billion doses worldwide to fight COVID-19. The vaccine will be manufactured at Emergent’s Baltimore Bayview facility that is designed for rapid manufacturing of vaccines and treatments in large quantities during public health emergencies, according to the release. The facility is classified as a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing and a result of a public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The release said Johnson & Johnson is negotiating a long-term commercial manufacturing agreement to help the company be able to have large-scale substance manufacturing capabilities to reach its vaccine goal. “When mission-driven organizations combine talents and capabilities, potential solutions to serious issues like COVID-19 become more within reach to benefit patients," said Robert G. Kramer Sr., president and CEO of Emergent BioSolutions. "We are proud of our collaboration with Johnson & Johnson and are equally committed to our longstanding relationship with the U.S. government. Produced by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, the vaccine is adenovirus-based, the release said, and is planned to be available next year. Emergent’s facility in the Hopkins Bayview neighborhood, has the ability to bring candidates into the clinic quickly at a clinical scale, the release said, as it works across four independent suites. It can also meet the demands for the commercial volumes, producing “hundreds of millions” of doses of the vaccine that is needed on an annual basis to meet customer demand, the release said. “Eight years ago, HHS invested in novel public-private partnerships to create three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing or CIADMs to help strengthen the nation’s biotech infrastructure to prepare and respond to emergencies,” said Gary Disbrow, Ph.D., acting director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, in the release. “Leveraging the capacity available at the Bayview CIADM to speed development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccine is precisely how we envisioned these centers be used in pandemic response.” Emergent BioSolutions is also developing two potential treatments for COVID-19, the release said, and is collaborating with three other innovators to help develop and manufacture their vaccines.

Maryland VA outpatient clinics closed as coronavirus spreads; Carroll Transit halts ‘heavily utilized’ shuttle route
.W
The VA Maryland Health Care System is temporarily closing all its community-based outpatient clinics on Monday as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on Friday announced the closure, which is effective March 30 and includes the Baltimore VA Medical Center clinic on Greene Street. Carroll Transit usually takes patients to the Greene Street facility, Fort Detrick VA Clinic and Martinsburg VA Medical Center in West Virginia, according to Crystal Winebrenner, executive director of Carroll Transit. Trips to Fort Detrick and Martinsburg will continue, she said, as they are not affected by the closure. However, Winebrenner said March 27, “The Baltimore shuttle is heavily utilized.” Typically, their Mad Dog veterans shuttle takes about 40 trips to the Greene Street facility per month, Winebrenner said, but now that’s on hold. The shuttle usually transports between nine and 11 people each to Fort Detrick and Martinsburg, she said. “As far as we’re concerned we’re not transporting to the Greene Street location after this week,” Winebrenner said Friday. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Friday morning that 774 people had tested positive for COVID-19 across the state and five people have died. Providers and staff at the clinics have transitioned to virtual care and patients are urged to use telehealth phone or video resources for scheduled appointments. The closure also affects primary care clinics at the Baltimore, Loch Raven and Perry Point VA Medical Centers, and services at the Cambridge, Eastern Baltimore County, and Pocomoke City outpatient clinics. Oncology, radiation oncology and other medically necessary specialty care clinic visits are excluded from telehealth. Veterans with nonurgent concerns can send a secure message about a health concern to their providers at myhealth.va.gov or use the VA Video Connect app for video appointments at mobile.va.gov/app/va-video-connect. The following resources are also available 24 hours a day, seven days a week: Telephone Care Line: If veterans need medical advice, they can call the Telephone Care Line at 800-865-2441.  Veterans Crisis Line: Specially trained responders are ready to help veterans in crisis when they call 800-273-8255 and press 1.  Prescription Refill Line: Veterans can request a prescription refill at 410-605-7395. They must have their Social Security and prescription numbers ready when calling and press option 2 for pharmacy prescription information. Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs centers, like the in Annapolis, offer outpatient mental health services and are providing individual sessions through telehealth resources. Updated information can be found at maryland.va.gov/COVID-19.asp. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

Maryland State Police say 79 people have been charged with violating governor’s coronavirus orders 
.W
Maryland State Police said 79 people have been charged in the past month with violating the governor’s executive orders against congregating in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Law enforcement agencies across the state have responded to 2,234 calls for service and conducted more than 28,300 compliance checks, according to state police, which collected the data between March 24 and April 23. Many of the violators are given warnings, while most of those who are charged also appear to be charged with other violations that prompted a police officer’s response, such as a traffic stop or traffic accident. Around Baltimore, several police agencies said calls for violations usually end with people dispersing without incident. For example, the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office has said that officers responded to eight calls between March 26 and April 14, but issued no charges. The sheriff’s office said that in five of those no violations were observed, while “the remaining three were resolved once the individuals were provided information on the order.” State Police did charge a Lutherville man after responding to a Westminster hotel for a gathering of teens where alcohol was present. That man was also charged with alcohol-related offenses, state police said.

‘Taking baseball away ... is tough’: American Legion season canceled due to coronavirus
.W
As sports cancellations spread across the nation, a staple in Maryland summer baseball will have to take this summer off. Due to concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic and liability issues, the American Legion summer baseball season in Maryland has been canceled. On April 7, Mike Riston, chairman of the Department of Maryland American Legion Baseball Committee, announced the cancellation of the Department of Maryland 2020 Senior and Junior ALB tournaments. The decision came after Americanism Commission and National Commander James W. Bill Oxford announced in late March the cancellation of the American Legion World Series, as well as the eight regional tournaments. “As hard as it was to make these decisions, the safety of all players, managers coaches, umpires, parents and fans must always come first,” said Bill Cauley, Department of Maryland American Legion Baseball Committee secretary, in an email to Maryland American Legion coaches in early April. A total of 25 legion teams had already registered in Maryland for the 2020 summer season prior to the cancellation of the season — 13 junior teams and 12 senior teams. The leagues and seasons can still continue, but there will be no state tournament and the teams can’t be associated with American Legion baseball if they play this summer. “We followed their lead,” Cauley said. “They said they would not sanction any legion ball this year and any teams that want to play an independent schedule are free to do that, but they can’t use the American Legion name. It’s a liability thing.” There are at least nine legion squads in the Baltimore region — Mount Airy Post 191, Sykesville Post 223, Laurel Post 60, Severna Park Post 175, Pasadena Post 277, Glen Burnie Post 40, Annapolis Post 7, Severn Post 276, and Dundalk Post 38. While several legion coaches differed in some opinions, they all agreed the safety of the players and their families is what matters most. “Once I found out that the region tournaments and the World Series were canceled, I knew the states wouldn’t be far behind,” said George Richardson III, who was preparing for his first season as Sykesville Post 223′s head coach. “They’re erring on the side of caution, and that’s the best way to do it. If we started doing stuff and the kids got sick, that doesn’t look good on anybody.” For many senior baseball players, the legion season was their last hope to play competitive baseball. Their high school seasons have been postponed due to the coronavirus, and some of them won’t be playing in college. “Taking baseball away from baseball people is tough,” said Richardson III, who coached at South Carroll High School from 1998-2011. “It’s a crazy thing we’re dealing with. No one expected it to be like this.” One question raised by the coaches was regarding why the decision was made in early April — two months before the start of the American Legion season and nearly four months before the American Legion World Series. One of the reasons, many opined, was monetary, as coaches are required to pay registration and insurance fees to participate as an American Legion team. The longer it took to make a decision, the more teams would have paid those fees with the season in question. Some teams had paid those fees prior to the cancellation, and Cauley said there hasn’t been a decision by the national headquarters yet regarding those payments. Overall, the season was canceled due to a combination of safety concerns for the players, coaches and parents as well a potential liability concern for ALB. “They were afraid something would happen and that they’d get sued, and that’s why they canceled the season,” said George Richardson Sr., who has been coaching legion baseball in Carroll County since 1981 and is now an assistant for Sykesville. Mount Airy draws from Linganore, South Carroll, Oakdale, and Urbana high schools, and coach Ryan Staley said he did his best to communicate with his senior team players via email after the decision was made to cancel. Staley said he understands the move based on safety of everyone involved, but he wants to pursue other avenues for summer baseball in 2020. “It’s going to be dependent on timing and things like that. I haven’t completely put the hammer down on the season just yet,” Staley said. “For some of the kids, this is their last summer playing baseball ever. If there’s any way that I can try to salvage that for them, or at least do something small, I would love for them to just have the opportunity to play one more game.”

Maryland received small fraction of coronavirus gear it requested from U.S. government, including body bags 
.W
Maryland requested more than a million masks, gloves and face shields — and 15,000 body bags — from the federal government, but has received only a small fraction as it tries to prepare for continued increases in new coronavirus cases, according to a new document. The state received about a third of the 778,129 face masks it requested, just 110,240 of the 421,532 N95 respirator masks it sought, well fewer than half of the 330,540 requested gloves and none of the 100,000 testing swabs it hoped to acquire to test for the virus, according to Federal Emergency Management Agency documents released Thursday by the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Maryland was the only state in its FEMA region — which also covers the surrounding states and the District of Columbia — to request body bags. The state sought 15,000 and hasn’t received any, according to the document. “The numbers are unbelievably low,” said U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat. Cardin said the state’s congressional delegation planned to talk soon about supplies with MaryAnn E. Tierney, the FEMA regional administrator for the states named in the document. The delegation said it identified six priority requests to FEMA: ventilators, personal protective equipment, testing supplies, swabs, pharmaceutical supplies for medical surge sites, and mobile medical labs. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland and officials from many states have warned they lack adequate personal protective equipment and medical supplies for health care workers to handle the pandemic. “These documents starkly illustrate a point that Governor Hogan has repeatedly made on behalf of his colleagues: no state has enough of what it needs to fight this pandemic,” tweeted Mike Ricci, the governor’s communications director. “The governors will continue to use all of the tools at their disposal to get the critical resources needed to save lives and slow the spread of the virus.” As Maryland seeks to ramp up testing, Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said it is significant that the state hasn’t received any of the 100,000 nasopharyngeal swabs it requested from federal supplies or the 50,000 viral transport units it sought. Transport media is a substance used for preserving a test sample on its way to a laboratory. Some supplies have come to states from the federal government’s Strategic National Stockpile, a large store of medical supplies for use when normal stocks are depleted in emergencies in the United States. The federal government does not specify the locations of its warehouses, but members of the Maryland Air National Guard have helped distribute equipment from one stockpile near Baltimore. In its planning, FEMA said it knew that the Strategic National Stockpile alone could not fulfill needed supplies and that it would need to turn to other sources. FEMA said in a statement Thursday that the federal government “will exhaust all means to identify and attain medical and other supplies needed to combat the virus.” It said it was tapping not only the Strategic National Stockpile, but also Department of Defense allocations and other sources. The agency said it has shipped 11.6 million N-95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.2 million face shields, 8,100 ventilators and other equipment to public health authorities around the nation. Maryland did receive 138 of 200 requested ventilators, the FEMA documents show. FEMA briefed leaders of the House committee Wednesday. According to a committee release, FEMA “conceded that, based on current (national) projections, the demand for ventilators ‘outstrips the capacity’ of the Strategic National Stockpile and those provided by the Department of Defense.” FEMA also said at the briefing that it recommended medical professionals reuse personal protective equipment, if necessary, given current shortages, according to the committee. Lacking necessary supplies, Maryland has continued to work with the federal government and with "private vendors, organizations and residents to get more personal protective equipment,” Maryland Health Department spokesman Charles Gischlar said Wednesday, before the document was released. The state agency had no immediate response Thursday to questions about the new documents and how it calculated a need for 15,000 body bags. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Maryland jumped 17% Thursday to more than 2,000. The global pandemic has infected more than 800,000 people and killed nearly 40,000 internationally and at least 36 in Maryland. Overall, the oversight committee said FEMA had distributed fewer than 10% of the N95 masks and less than 1% of gloves sought collectively by Maryland, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. “The administration was caught flat-footed when it came to supplies,” Van Hollen said. “This is a huge problem. This has been a source of enormous frustration and concern from the start.” With supplies of masks and other equipment in short supply, businesses, universities, volunteer groups and others in Maryland and around the nation have tried to fill in the gaps.

Howard County organizations come together to provide $100,000 to local nonprofits for coronavirus aid
.W
Four Howard County philanthropic organizations joined forces and established an online fundraising effort to provide county nonprofits with emergency funds to support them during the coronavirus pandemic. Over the course of 10 days, HoCoRespond.com raised $100,000 in emergency funding for nonprofits who are providing food security, housing, health care and child care services to those in need. The website was created by the Community Foundation of Howard County, the Horizon Foundation, the Women’s Giving Circle of Howard County and United Way of Central Maryland. Local nonprofits can begin applying Monday, with an April 10 midnight deadline, for the first round of funding. In order to apply, all organizations should be 5019(c)3 nonprofits that provide services to Howard County residents, according to a news release. The organizers “are coordinating to raise and deploy critical resources to nonprofits on the front lines of responding to the urgent health and economic needs of disproportionately impacted communities in Howard County,” Beverly White-Seals, president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Howard County, said in a statement. The website is continuing to accept donations, and the organizations plan to announce a second round of fundraising for local nonprofits. Barb Van Winkle, chairwoman of the Women’s Giving Circle of Howard County, said in a statement: “We will continue exploring the path forward in providing relief to our community and look forward to leveraging our strengths and working with others to make a bigger difference together than we might otherwise make alone.”

As the coronavirus outbreak confines more people to their homes, contributes to job losses and causes other financial hardships, it will also spur a rise in domestic violence, experts warn. “We all should be on high alert for these types of situations,” said Laura Dugan, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland. “It’s been well-documented in China. All of the factors are in place.” Advocates and officials from China to Greenland have reported recent increases in domestic violence complaints, and they point to the forced proximity and stress of the coronavirus pandemic as the primary factor. Baltimore Police have not seen an increase in domestic violence calls, a spokeswoman said. Baltimore-area service providers believe that’s because survivors are confined with their abusers and can’t reach out. They also say confusion about what services are available during this period may be contributing to fewer people coming forward. And as coronavirus spreads anxiety among much of Baltimore’s population — about money, about ability to buy food and protect ourselves and loved ones — those worries are particularly acute among the higher-risk population, including people victimized by abusive partners, experts said. When clients feel they have limited options, they might be more likely to return to an abuser, advocates said. Abusers can also use the situation to manipulate a victim, said Jacqueline Robarge, director of Power Inside, a service provider in Baltimore that works with victims of domestic abuse, as well as those with addiction issues or who are just returning from jail. “This is a time to exploit. The 'I need you here. Come home,’ can be more appealing to a victim, rather than taking their chances at a shelter," Robarge said. Though area nonprofit offices have closed to prevent the disease’s spread, services are still available, providers say, and they urge victims to seek help when they are ready, which can be as simple as reaching out to a trusted friend or to one of several area nonprofits that help people leave abusive relationships. “Our services are still available,” said Amanda Rodriguez, executive director of the nonprofit TurnAround, based in Towson. TurnAround is receiving fewer calls than normal, Rodriguez said, adding that she believes the need has increased and will continue to increase. “Anecdotally, whenever you have periods of time when people are together — snowstorms, holidays — you see an uptick in violence,” she said. TurnAround’s busiest time is usually in January after the holidays are over and an abuser has returned to work and a victim has an opportunity to seek help. Officials and advocates in locales around the world have pointed to significant increases in domestic violence when coronavirus has led to less mobility and to economic stress. Police in one county in China’s Hubei province saw domestic violence complaints triple in February compared with the previous year, according to a report in Chinese media. In Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, officials halted alcohol sales to combat an increase in domestic violence against children once schools were shut down, The Guardian reported. Another area of concern, Rodriguez said, is the increase in gun sales during the coronavirus outbreak. Some clients have expressed confusion about whether the courts are still performing emergency protection orders. They are, although many other court services have been curtailed. Robarge, the Power Inside director, said she and other providers try to address a wide range of issues to keep their clients safe. Robarge said one client worried about how she would get to her regular medical appointments. Would public transportation be safe? Would it continue? Many of her clients don’t have the financial resources to purchase bulk items, she said. Clients living in group homes or shelters worry how they will keep safe if the coronavirus spreads among its population. Robarge said her organization focuses on basic services, including providing food and rental assistance, but she is anticipating many more complex challenges as the disease spreads and social distancing continues. Robarge said she also is struggling to keep her clients informed about such a new and dangerous disease. In the past, she said, she and her staff were well-versed in health concerns such as HIV or tuberculosis. But because COVID-19 is still being studied, she’s struggling to answer all her clients’ questions and concerns. “It’s hard to tell someone what to do when they have to make hard choices,” she said. As many businesses struggle to balance work with keeping employees safe, so too are many nonprofits as they struggle with the best ways to safely deliver services. Janice Miller, director of programs and clinical services at House of Ruth Maryland, said the nonprofit’s 23-bed emergency shelter remains open but with added precautions to protect clients and staff. "I’ve never experienced something like this,” she said in her 30 years of work in the field. The flu or chickenpox didn’t affect residents, their children and staff as drastically as COVID-19 threatens to do, she said. Miller said the shelter has not had anyone test positive for COVID-19, but staff members there are preparing for when that could happen. “Some of the same precautions are very helpful in trying to slow the spread of this disease,” such as extra cleaning and emphasizing hand-washing, “but there is only so much we can do.” Miller said staff members have sought out additional personal protective equipment, and the shelter has stopped doubling up individuals in rooms. Each of the 23 bedrooms has its own bathroom. Like so many people in search of toilet paper and cleaning products, she said, staff members have worked hard to stay stocked up on supplies. Still, they haven’t been able to restock hand sanitizer. Miller said the House of Ruth continues to provide counseling and safety planning services, but it has been forced to shut down some other services, such as the Ruth’s Closet boutique that sells used clothing. Miller also worried about the ability of smaller nonprofits to continue providing needed care in the face of this challenge. “I think it’s difficult for programs to weather this crisis because if you only have a staff that’s a handful of people, then you aren’t going to have the staffing to maintain the program” or get the additional resources to operate safely, she said. “Being a larger program, we are still struggling," Miller said. But all the advocates advise anyone who is experiencing domestic violence to seek help. “A general first step would be to reach out to a safe person,” Dugan suggested. That could be a friend or a family member, she said. While it might be difficult for a victim to distance themselves from an abuser, she suggested taking a walk or attempting to make a phone call from a bathroom, where they might not draw attention. She also said “bystanders” can be proactive, and call their friends or family members if they are concerned. “The quicker [victims] break their isolation, the better they will be,” Dugan said. The House of Ruth’s 24-hour hotline is 410-889-RUTH (7884). Turn Around’s 24-hour hotline is 443-279-0379. The National Domestic Violence Hotline is 800-799-SAFE (7233).

Tylenol, soup and rest can treat most symptoms of coronavirus (whether you have it or not)
.W
First comes a slight fever, then some coughing and chest heaviness. It might be the flu or just the common cold, or it could be the new coronavirus that’s got the world in a panic. Many of us will contract this scary new virus at some point — some doctors say two-thirds of us, other experts suggest a third — but schools, malls and other gathering places are closed to prevent it from spreading so fast that patients overwhelm the nation’s health system. But for most of us who get sick, the advice for treatment, save for the most severe cases, is the same as for a cold or the flu. And it sounds a lot like what mom used to prescribe: rest, fluids and most of all, chicken soup. That and isolate yourself for a couple of weeks to keep from sharing it. “A lot of the self-care advice is the same no matter what it is, with the social distancing aspect to it if it’s coronavirus,” said Dr. Richard Bruno, a primary care doctor at Chase Brexton Health Services. Whether it’s flu, a cold or coronavirus, Bruno said, “you really need to get some rest.” There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, so besides taking it easy, you’re going to want to treat your symptoms. Honey works better than most cough syrups. Antihistamines, including Zyrtec and Claritin, help if there is congestion. Bruno recommends Tylenol over Advil for pain because it’s less harsh for people with most chronic health conditions. He said there’s not much science behind advice to avoid Advil-style anti-inflammatory drugs for coronavirus. (Tylenol is acetaminophen; Advil is ibuprofen.) Stay hydrated with warm fluids like tea. And this part gets repeated a lot by the public health community these days, but cover coughs with tissues that you throw away and wash your hands frequently for 20 seconds each time with soap. Singing the birthday song is optional. If you suspect you have it, don’t rush off to the emergency room or even go to a doctor. Call your doctor, a nearby clinic or the local health department instead when symptoms start to ask for advice. The good news is that 80 percent of those with coronavirus have mild to moderate cases and recover well at home, doctors say. But those who develop the telltale sign of a serious coronavirus case — difficulty breathing — call your doctor again. And if you feel you can’t breathe, you need to get to a hospital. If you drive, call first. If you call 911, tell the operator your potential coronavirus status. Avoid public transportation. Otherwise, stay physically apart from family and anyone else in the house. Stay isolated for 14 days, longer if you still have symptoms. Specifically: Stay inside at least 72 hours past when you last had a fever, other symptoms such as coughing have improved and it’s been seven days since symptoms first appeared, said Dr. Dr. Leticia Dzirasa, Baltimore City health commissioner. Those with no symptoms but who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 need to quarantine themselves for 14 days to make sure they don’t develop symptoms, she said. The virus is very contagious. The average incubation period, the time for symptoms to develop, is five days, but they can surface from 2 to 14 days after exposure. If you need help with groceries, medication, or just as important, some attention, many neighborhood associations have set up support networks. “I wouldn’t push yourself at this point, especially if you have moderate symptoms,” Bruno said. Many people will feel well enough to do some activities, but they should be mindful of their recovery and of spreading the illness. That means some real inconveniences, such as staying inside or in your own backyard, if you think you might have been exposed, Dzirasa said. Even if you don’t have symptoms, keep your in-person circle as small as possible. That means if your mother-in law is older and has underlying health conditions, she shouldn’t babysit. Dzirasa notes that most Maryland cases are in younger adults, but seniors are more at risk for complications. The virus has sickened thousands in the United States, and hundreds of thousands across the globe, and no one yet knows when the peak will be reached. The public health community is keeping tabs through testing, and though testing is ramping up, there aren’t enough supplies to go around. Testing requires a doctor’s order and instructions on where to safely go to be swabbed. In reality, many people will wait days for results or just won’t be able to get tested, Dzirasa said. That means taking personal responsibility and isolating yourself if you have symptoms. Others must stay inside and away from others if they are exposed but have no symptoms yet. A note about masks: Doctors say healthy people don’t need them and they should be reserved for medical staff and those who are sick. As people hunker down, scientists remain busy learning about the virus, how it transmits and how to stop it. Here are a few things they’ve learned, according to a recent webcast by the Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. The virus spreads pretty easily from person to person, better than some other coronaviruses such as SARS, MERS and the common cold. So there are more infections, but most are mild. Younger people who have few or no symptoms are surely spreading the disease as they go about their day. When infected people cough, relatively large droplets containing the virus land on other people or shared surfaces where the virus can live for up to 24 hours and be picked up on the hand of passersby. Antimicrobial cleaners work well to kill the virus. Bleach mixed in a 1-to-10 ratio with water works, as does rubbing alcohol of 70%. At 90% it can be diluted with water a bit. Warm weather may not slow the spread, as happens sometimes with flu viruses, since this is a new virus and no one who hasn’t had it has immunity. “We have to prepare for dealing with this during the summer,” said Andy Pekosz, a Hopkins professor of molecular microbiology and immunology. There are therapies in the works but nothing ready for prime time. That includes possibly using antibodies from people who have recovered, as well as older drugs developed for other purposes. Several vaccines are entering the testing phase, but they aren’t expected to be ready for 12 to 18 months. (It takes months to properly test a drug’s safety and effectiveness, let alone mass produce it.) That’s why closing public gathering places such as restaurants, bars and malls is important to help stop spread. It’s even important to limit other outings, for routine doctor visits, for example. If you go to the grocery, wipe the cart and wash your hands well afterward. And don’t touch your face until you do. Countries that have practiced so-called social distancing, keeping about six feet away from others, have been successful in curbing new cases, or at least curbing the number that occur at the same time, which eases demands on the health care system. That’s called flattening the curve. All this talk of social distancing, however, only applies to physical space. Doctors and other say it’s important to keep social connections by calling, texting or otherwise staying connected. Those who are sick can open a door or window if no one is near. Those who are well should continue to get exercise, for their bodies and minds. The pandemic is causing high levels of anxiety and stress for the sick and the healthy alike, said Christine Barnabic, an education program management specialist at the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. That makes self-care important. She said those who normally work out should consider virtual workouts being offered free or at discounts by many gyms via Instagram or Facebook or smart phone or TV. The large fitness chain Planet Fitness, for example, is offering free classes online each day. Some companies also are offering some free sessions of their meditation or breathing practices such as Headspace and Insight Timer. “Keeping a routine. I think that’s big,” Barnabic said. “If I get off my routine of working out, that will get me down." She also recommended rising at the regular time, maintaining a healthy diet, staying well hydrated, socializing (electronically) and getting some fresh (distant from others) air. But, she added, “listen to your body, too. If you’re not feeling well, you do need to slow down.”

As coronavirus spreads, Maryland officials reopen Laurel hospital to prepare for surge of patients
.W
As deaths from the coronavirus pandemic continue to rise, Maryland officials have reopened a former hospital in Laurel as part of the state’s preparations for a potential surge in infected patients. At a news conference Wednesday in front of the hospital, Gov. Larry Hogan and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said the addition of 135 beds at the facility — which was operating as an outpatient center — will help put the state “on track” to exceed its goal of adding 6,000 hospital beds throughout Maryland. “It is once again going to help us save lives, not just here in Prince George’s County, but throughout the national capital region,” the governor said. Hogan, a Republican, started a news conference outside the hospital by reciting the latest totals of coronavirus, including 631 confirmed deaths in Maryland. The state reported 14,775 people Wednesday with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Alsobrooks noted that 152 of the state’s deaths from the coronavirus have been in Prince George’s County. “These are not cases. These are people,” said Alsobrooks, a Democrat. Hogan said turning the former Laurel Regional Hospital, which opened in 1978, back into a full-fledged hospital was an idea his team discussed early in the crisis. The hospital, which is in Prince George’s County but close to Anne Arundel and Howard counties, reopened Monday and has admitted about two dozen patients. “The need today is disproportionately in Prince George’s County," said Dr. Mohan Suntha, president and CEO of the University of Maryland Medical System, which owns and manages the Laurel hospital. Hogan said reopening the Laurel hospital, creating a field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center, expanding the number of beds at several other hospitals and installing 22 “surge response tents” at hospitals means the state eventually will have 6,700 more hospital beds. “Hopefully, we’re not going to need to use all of those,” Hogan said. He suggested that the state’s early and aggressive actions have helped keep the demand from overloading the state’s hospitals. Hospital capacity is one of the four factors in Hogan’s “Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery,” which he said he would announce Friday. The other factors are: expanding availability of testing, increasing the supply of protective equipment for health care workers, and building a robust contract tracing system to track down people who have been exposed to the virus. The governor said the state has made progress in each of the four areas, but it’s premature to start lifting restrictions. “We’re currently still on an upward trajectory, rather than a downward trajectory,” he said. Hogan has received some pressure from critics who want the restrictions lifted and the economy reopened sooner, including from participants in a noisy drive-in protest Saturday in Annapolis. Some Republican lawmakers have asked the governor to consider lifting restrictions on a regional basis, instead of a statewide one. Hogan has said he wants to test 10,000 people per day — a goal that would be helped by the state’s recent purchase of 500,000 tests from a South Korean company. “This 500,000-test capacity is equal to the total amount of testing that has been completed by four of the top five states,” he said. Since the shipment from South Korea, the governor said that he’s been inundated with requests from other states. “My phone was lighting up from every governor in America saying how do we get some of those tests?” Hogan said. He said the tests were for Marylanders first, but he would try to help other states, as well. A second Korean Air plane with supplies landed Wednesday at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport in Linthicum, though Hogan declined to offer details on the cargo. He said his wife, Yumi Hogan, greeted the plane’s crew. “I can’t tell you a whole lot about it ... They just brought some additional supplies that will come in handy,” he said. Hogan said his team has made “great progress” in securing more personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks and respirators. He said shipments are arriving regularly, including some from South Korea. To improve contact tracing, Hogan said the state signed a contract with a research organization, NORC at the University of Chicago, but did not provide details of the cost or scope of the agreement. The state plans to have 1,000 contact tracers who will be trained to use databases to track down people who have been exposed to others with the virus. A new “COVID Link” platform will be used to help facilitate the tracing of 1,000 patients each day. Earlier Wednesday, Alsobrooks and Suntha spoke to a virtual meeting of state lawmakers. Alsobrooks said she wanted to warn men ― and in particular, black men ― that some are waiting too long to seek health care when they feel sick. “Men are waiting much too long to seek medical treatment,” Alsobrooks said. “They are waiting way too late. We are having people dying at home. Please seek treatment sooner.” Doctors in Baltimore say the hospitals are seeing fewer people in emergency rooms with heart attack and stroke symptoms. Suntha said during the virtual call with lawmakers that he’s seen a “popcorn” effect among the hospital network’s 13 locations. When the virus first came to Maryland, there was a surge of patients at Anne Arundel County’s Baltimore Washington Medical Center, Suntha told lawmakers. Now, he said, the surge of patients is in Prince George’s. “We’ve described a popcorn effect. Not every community has experienced the surge at the same time or severity,” Suntha said. “We’ve been able to allocate resources to where the surge is most prominent.” He said when a hospital begins to see a surge, officials can move patients to other sites in the UMMS network, such as facilities in Baltimore. “Citizens of Prince George’s County are well cared for,” said Suntha, adding that the Laurel facility is “a huge asset.” Suntha said Maryland officials directed newly acquired federal resources to the location. “The first 35 ventilators that the state got through their allocation ... went to the Laurel campus,” he added. UMMS converted the former Laurel Regional Hospital to an outpatient medical center after acquiring it in 2017. The Laurel Medical Center is staffed by nearly 400 contracted health care workers, in addition to UMMS staff, officials said. Suntha said the UMMS network is not currently overwhelmed. State data show about 1,400 hospital beds are being used by COVID-19 patients. “We are thinking about what next week looks like and what two weeks look like from here," Suntha said. "That’s where our angst increases.”

‘If we can’t go, who’s going?’: Carroll County firefighters, EMS working amid coronavirus, with some changes
.W
While many aspects of life in Carroll County have come to a halt during the coronavirus pandemic, fire and emergency medical services carry on — though with some modifications. Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency March 5 in reaction to the spread of the coronavirus, also known by the disease it causes, COVID-19. Since then, bars and restaurants have switched to carryout and delivery, businesses deemed nonessential have been closed, and an order is requiring Marylanders to stay at home except for only “absolutely necessary” reasons. But when you call 911, someone has to answer. “We’ve changed things a great deal," said Kevin Dayhoff, public information officer for Westminster Volunteer Fire Department. Dispatchers now ask 911 callers questions to determine whether the caller might pose a risk for exposing first responders to COVID-19, according to Dayhoff. If there’s potential for a case, the dispatcher conveys that to the fire company so emergency medical technicians and paramedics can don personal protective equipment before responding, he said. “We’re going through a lot of personal protective equipment and we’re concerned about the supply chain on that,” Dayhoff said. Westminster EMS Capt. Laura Tyler told Dayhoff there’s been a need for personal protective equipment for some time. “We have been strained from the beginning,” Tyler said. "Our normal acquisition routes are having difficulty fulfilling needs across the country since early February, before this became a pandemic or a local threat. Reserving 911 for life-threatening emergencies will help us conserve our equipment.” Donald Fair, president of Carroll County Volunteer Emergency Services Association, said all volunteer fire companies in the county are taking precautions. First responders are disinfecting equipment, apparatus, and the clothing they wear to protect themselves and others. “We just want to keep ourselves well because if we can’t go, who’s going?” Fair said. As of April 1, Maryland has reported a total of 1,985 coronavirus cases. At least 31 deaths cases had been reported across the state. Firefighters and EMS providers have changed how they operate within the fire station. For Mount Airy’s fire company, public information officer Doug Alexander said, company members are cleaning the station twice a day instead of once, hand sanitizer is at each entrance and surfaces are wiped down often. Mount Airy closed its firehouse to the public March 12. “Anybody that’s not a member of the fire company does not come to the fire station,” Alexander said, and members are encouraged to be present only when they have to be. He said the pandemic has taken the togetherness out of the firehouse. Before the virus spread to Maryland, some of the eldest members of the Mount Airy company often gathered at the station to drink coffee and talk, he said. But now that’s not happening. Chairs that usually are clustered together now sit six feet apart, in accordance with the guidelines or health professionals and state officials. And the company’s awards ceremony and banquet was canceled. “Nobody knows when this is going to come to an end,” Alexander said. “We’re not hanging out like we were.” Fundraising suffers Another blow dealt to the fire companies during this time is a loss in revenue. Mount Airy is canceling firehouse rentals and fundraisers two weeks at a time, evaluating the situation as time goes on, according to Alexander. If this continues, it will put a “tremendous strain” on their budget, he said. The fire company, he said, stands to lose between $15,000 and $20,000 if cancellations continue up to May 24. “That’s a real healthy bite out of our budget,” Alexander said. Under normal circumstances, they would turn to the community for help. “Our community has never let us down, but the problem with this time is our community is struggling because they’re not working,” he said. Dayhoff is also concerned about the fire department’s finances in Westminster. “Fundraising remains a problem,” he wrote in an email March 24. “We greatly appreciate the support of Westminster and Carroll County governments. That certainly helps to keep the lights on, but the bulk of our operations are directly supported by public donations. That support is critical; and at a time when we have increased expenditures to meet the demands of the COVID-19 health emergency, the inability to hold fundraisers is a problem.” Fair offered a prediction for the fire companies. “I think everyone’s going to experience a shortfall in revenue because of this,” he said. However, there are some positive aspects to the situation. Alexander said April 1 that call volume is down slightly overall and a good number of members are responding to calls, perhaps more than usual because people are home more, practicing social distancing. At Westminster, Dayhoff said April 1, first responders continue to work well together and call volume has held steady. “However, we would like to caution folks to only call EMS for serious emergencies so that we can conserve our staff and supplies,” Dayhoff said. With an uncertain future ahead, Fair said the volunteer fire companies will modify, adapt and overcome so they can continue to serve Carroll County. “When you call 911 for help,” Fair said, “help will be there.”

Maryland Gov. Hogan announces state budget freeze as coronavirus hammers economy, officials eye $2.8B revenue loss
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Friday that he’s enacting a state budget freeze as the state continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic that has infected nearly 7,000 Marylanders. “The state is immediately instituting a budget freeze on all state spending across all state government agencies,” Hogan said during a news conference at the State House in Annapolis. The state will only spend money on coronavirus-related expenses and payroll, Hogan said. Additionally, the state will institute a hiring freeze and look for possible cuts in the budget. The Republican governor also said he was unlikely to sign into law any bills that require additional future spending. Hogan’s announcement came as the state continued to see an increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths due to the coronavirus. On Friday morning, the state reported that another 33 Marylanders lost their lives to the virus, bringing the state’s number of total deaths to 171. As tempting as it may be to visit family on the Easter weekend, Hogan urged Marylanders to continue following the state’s stay-at-home orders and to observe social distancing when going out for groceries or other essential tasks. “We are ramping up the curve,” he said. “This is going to be one of our most dangerous times ever. … This would be the worst possible time for people to be violating executive orders and congregating.” As warnings continue about the need to slow the spread of the virus, Hogan and other officials are starting to take stock of the financial impact of the pandemic. Hogan’s announcement of budget and hiring freezes came on the heels of predictions from the state’s comptroller that the state could miss out on billions of dollars just in the next three months. In one worst-case scenario developed by the comptroller, the state could lose out on $2.8 billion by the end of June, if the stay-at-home order remains in place that long. If the order extends through May, the hit to the state could be about $1.5 billion. Comptroller Peter Franchot said Friday that the pandemic represents “the most devastating economic catastrophe of our lifetimes.” “This is something that’s going to take years to recover from,” said Franchot, a Democrat, during a virtual news conference on Facebook. The pandemic comes at a difficult time for government budgets. About 44% of the state’s revenue comes in during the final three months of the budget year: April, May and June. “We should plan for the worst and hope for the better,” said Andrew Schaufele, director of revenue estimates for the comptroller. The general fund gets 45% of its money from income tax withholding, so when people lose jobs and face pay cuts, less money comes to the state. More than 240,000 Marylanders have filed for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks — which is more than the state saw during all of 2019. Another 25% of the general fund comes from the sales tax, which has taken a hit with people staying home and buying fewer goods. When the numbers come up short, Maryland has options for balancing its budget. At the start of the pandemic, Maryland had about $1.2 billion in its “rainy day fund.” The Hogan administration already dipped into the fund, and the governor cautioned he may need to use all of it. And the Board of Public Works — comprised of the governor, comptroller and treasurer — can make mid-year budget cuts. Maryland stands to receive billions of dollars in aid from the federal government, but much of that is earmarked for specific components of the coronavirus response and to be sent to local governments — not to fill holes in the state budget created by lost taxes. Lawmakers already approved a budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, but Franchot suggested the entire state budget needs to be “rethought.” Hogan said the pandemic will be costly for years to come and “substantial budget actions” will be needed. “Responding to this crisis will likely create a multi-year budget issue,” he said. Hogan also said he is not likely to support bills that are awaiting his signature that would affect the budget in the future. “It is very unlikely that any bills that require increased spending will be signed into law,” he said. The Democratic-led General Assembly passed a sweeping education bill that requires billions in additional spending on public schools in the coming years, though it inserted a provision to pause the increases if there’s a significant financial downturn. William E. “Brit” Kirwan, a former University of Maryland chancellor who led a commission that championed the legislation, said he remains hopeful the bill might be signed. He said the state’s commitment to the education policies in the bill is more important than the timing of the funding. Lawmakers also passed targeted tax increases on digitally downloaded products, online advertising and tobacco and nicotine products, and they made changes to corporate tax rules to generate more money. Hogan has about one month to determine the fate of those bills. The governor made several other announcements during his Friday afternoon news conference. He announced that the June 2 primary elections will be conducted largely by mail, with limited in-person voting available for people who cannot vote by mail. “In those rare cases where people must vote in person, significant social distancing practices must be implemented,” Hogan said. The state also is encouraging people who have recovered from the coronavirus to join a new “Covid Connect” program to share their experiences and possibly sign up for involvement in research. Fran Phillips, the deputy secretary of health, said more than 400 Marylanders have recovered and are eligible to participate. Phillips said she has spoken to many who have recovered. “What has been so striking is their interest in giving back,” she said. Hogan also said the state is spending $2.5 million to launch a “large-scale” coronavirus testing program with the University of Maryland School of Medicine that could eventually process 20,000 tests per day. He said the state will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up a decontamination site for N95 masks at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport in Linthicum. It will use a decontamination system developed by Battelle, an Ohio-based company. The facility will use a decontamination unit that can “clean and sterilize” up to 80,000 masks per day, Hogan said. “This newly developed technology will allow them to be reused, which will help protect our healthcare workers and those on the front lines, while we await the new production and additional supply of PPE,” Hogan said. Officials also offered updates on efforts to help the sick and the unemployed. Phillips said health “strike teams” have been working with nursing homes to help with coronavirus testing and medical care for residents. Dozens of nursing homes across the state have had outbreaks of the virus, including the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where 81 residents and 31 staff had tested positive as of Thursday. Eighteen residents there have died. The strike teams also have visited homes for medically fragile children to ensure they have appropriate medical equipment and training to handle any coronavirus cases, Phillips said. Tiffany Robinson, the state secretary of labor, said she is working to double the staff of employees who handle claims for unemployment benefits. Many applicants have complained about their phone calls going unanswered and delays in getting their claims filed. “We are all hands on deck to provide Marylanders the support that they need," she said. Hogan became emotional when discussing Sunday’s celebration of Easter. The Christian holiday celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who had died by crucifixion. “Easter really is a day of hope, which is something that all of us could desperately use right now,” Hogan said. “So this weekend, I ask all Marylanders — regardless of their faith — to reflect on that spirit of hope and carry it forward in these difficult days ahead.” The governor did offer one bright note: The Easter bunny, Hogan declared, is an essential employee.

Maryland’s primary is postponed because of coronavirus. Here’s what voters need to know.
.W
Maryland has postponed its April 28 primary to June 2, the latest in a series of drastic actions the state is taking in an attempt to protect people from the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Larry Hogan issued a proclamation Tuesday to change the date of the election, during which voters will nominate candidates for the Baltimore mayor’s race, U.S. House contests and the presidential primary. Here is what you need to know: Will there still be early voting? Yes, but it will also be moved back. If you want to cast your ballot early, you can do so between May 21 and May 28. Can I vote on primary day at my regular polling place? State election officials are working with local boards to make sure regular voting locations that were available for April 28 can host polling on June 2. Also, some polling places are in senior centers, and older people are more susceptible to developing a severe case of COVID-19. That could mean such polling places should be moved. If a polling place changes, election officials will notify voters. What if I feel safer voting by mail? In Maryland, anyone who wants to can vote by mail without giving a reason. Voters who prefer to vote from home can request an absentee ballot by going to the state Elections Board website and clicking the “Request a Ballot" box. The deadline to request an absentee ballot for the primary is May 26, if the voter wants to receive the ballot by mail, or May 29 if the voter wants to receive the ballot electronically. Ballots must be postmarked on or by June 2. How will the health of voters and poll workers be protected? The state elections board will work with the Maryland health department on a plan to keep people safe when they go to the polls. The plan will be submitted to the governor by April 3. I’m in the 7th Congressional District. How does this affect me? This district — which represents parts of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County — has not had representation in Congress since U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings died in October. Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman, won the Feb. 4 Democratic special primary for Cummings’ seat, while Kimberly Klacik won the GOP contest. The date for the special general election between those two nominees remains unchanged: April 28. But all ballots will now be cast by mail. Ballots will be sent out later this month to all eligible voters. They must be postmarked and sent back on or before April 28. There’s another wrinkle: Once the ballots for the special general election are counted, the winner will be sworn in to fill the seat through January, when Cummings’ term ends. The new House member, however, must face challengers in the June 2 primary for the nomination to run in November for a term of his or her own. Was this all necessary? Maryland is under a state of emergency because of the coronavirus, and officials are restricting gatherings of more than 50 people to help curb the spread of the COVID-19 illness. As of Tuesday, there were dozens of confirmed cases in the state. Health experts have also said older people are more vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease. A large percentage of election judges are older than 60, and could be at at a particular risk. “I have two main priorities — keeping Marylanders safe and protecting their constitutional right to vote,” Hogan said at a news conference in Annapolis.

Maryland National Guard company reports to Westminster in response to coronavirus crisis
.W
In response to the growing threat posed by the coronavirus known as COVID-19, on March 12 Gov. Larry Hogan activated the National Guard throughout the state of Maryland — including a unit based in Westminster. Members of the 29th Military Police Company unit — which, like all other National Guard units, acts on the commands of the governor — have reported to the MG Henry C. Evans Armory, at 350 Hahn Road in Westminster, for duty. “Soldiers from the unit are being activated,” said Major Kurt Rauschenberg, Maryland National Guard spokesman. “They’re coming into the armory, there in Westminster, to get additional information on what’s going on, and then we’ll go through in processing phase where they go and get prescreened for health screening just to make sure that they’re not showing any of the symptoms of COVID, or anything like that.” According to Rauschenberg, the Westminster unit will support in statewide efforts. “So that particular unit there, they’re going to be part of the support overall,” he said. “Some of the missions that we’re looking at conducting here in the Maryland Guard’s support is in conjunction with the other departments across Maryland such as the Maryland Department of Health, transportation, logistics, commodity distribution, things of that nature.” As of Friday afternoon, three cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Carroll, according to Maggie Kunz, public information officer for Carroll County Health Department. The Maryland Department of Health website depicts a map that shows the number of known cases across the counties. Early Friday, the map showed four cases in Carroll County, but it was later revised to three. Kunz said the initial number the state posted was an error. On Friday Maryland officials confirmed 42 new cases of the coronavirus since Thursday, raising the total to 149 cases. As of Friday evening, the coronavirus had resulted in 216 deaths in the United States out of about almost 17,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic March 11. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Maryland Sen. Van Hollen criticizes ‘political messaging’ over coronavirus but expresses faith in health system
.W
Maryland’s U.S. senators expressed faith Friday in the handling of the new coronavirus, saying a vaccine is being developed as quickly as possible and that new testing capacity -- covered by insurance ---should help contain the respiratory disease. U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said he hoped the White House would improve its messaging as Maryland and the nation seeks to keep the disease in check. “This needs to be dealt with as a public health crisis and not a political crisis or political problem,” the Democrat said after visiting the vaccine research center at the National Institutes of Health along with Sen. Ben Cardin and U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin. “I think it’s been very clear that at least at the very outset you had a lot of political messaging coming out of the White House and President Trump when they should have been letting the scientists guide the conversation," Van Hollen said.. “It’s very important people have the confidence in the information that they are getting,” he said. “I think we’re all pleased with the way this has been handled in Maryland and in Montgomery county. That’s a good model.” Maryland health officials on Thursday confirmed the state’s first three cases of the coronavirus, all in Montgomery County. The Maryland state lab in Baltimore is currently testing people. Cardin told reporters at NIH that testing kits were being made available to private labs and “are now being delivered as we speak.” Cardin said it is significant that the commercial lab tests have been classified as an essential health benefit. “The good news is that it will be reimbursable under Medicare. It will be reimbursable under Medicaid,” the Democrat said. Public health officials have said a vaccine is at least a year away. Van Hollen said that is a relatively short time considering the trials that must be conducted to make sure the vaccine is safe. “They are moving quickly – very quickly – for developing a vaccine by historical standards,” he said.

Baltimore grocers attempt to protect most vulnerable from coronavirus with special hours to mixed results 
.W
Several regional grocery chains have designated certain hours as exclusive times for seniors, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems to shop for food and other essentials during the coronavirus outbreak. Giant Food, Safeway, Dollar General, Target and others seek to limit certain populations’ exposure to crowds as federal and state officials encourage people to practice social distancing as a means of slowing the spread of COVID-19, the highly contagious upper respiratory disease. In Maryland, one Prince George’s County man in his 60s has died from the novel coronavirus, and at least 149 others have tested positive for it. Though children can contract it, the coronavirus appears to pose more of a threat to those over 60 and those with underlying health issues including heart disease, diabetes and lung disease. Social distancing measures designed to safeguard lives and keep the healthcare system afloat have led to the mass closures of schools, retail stores, restaurants and offices as essential services such as groceries, banks and pharmacies remain open. But, while grocers’ special hours, which vary between chains, may be well-intentioned, some shoppers felt no safer or better protected. “I couldn’t maintain a proper social distance,” said Bonnie Kind, 64, who went to the Giant in Pikesville at 6 a.m. Friday in search of fresh produce and meats. She ended up leaving her shopping cart and walking out of the store. “People were on top of each other and literally pressing against me,” she said. “People in line to check out were all bunched together.” Kind said Giant staffers were restocking the shelves as shoppers moved carts through the aisles. “It was poor planning on their part,” she said. “And there were people there who were younger ages. There was no one there enforcing it." A representative from Giant Food did not respond to a request for comment. In a Wednesday announcement, the regional grocer said it would “continue to work on restocking our shelves” and will prepare “to serve to the best of our ability.” In a previous Baltimore Sun interview, Ira Kress, interim president of Giant Food, said there was no food or supply shortage. Rather, stores just need time to replenish their supplies, he said, with demand surging over the last two weeks and causing heavy foot traffic and long lines. “We are reacting to the situation as fast as we can. ... The grocery industry is reacting, and we will be able to ramp up to meet the increased demand of our customers," he said. Sharon Dow, a Winsdor Mill resident, said that while she did not find everything she wanted — she had hoped to snag some cleaning supplies, such as Clorox and Lysol products — she did buy bagels, orange juice and steak. She said she also felt frustrated about the crowd size, which she had hoped would be smaller. “The population in the neighborhood tends to be older,” said Dow, 68. Bill Matthews, 72, meanwhile, thought the staff handled the situation as best they could. He had hoped to find more meat in stock, but said he managed to spend more than $100 anyway. “They’re not going to have everything,” the Randallstown resident said. “But the staff, they were real cool.” A little before 8 a.m. Thursday, a steady stream of customers could be seen at the Safeway in Fells Point. The store announced it would be open from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. for seniors and those vulnerable to the coronavirus on Tuesdays and Thursdays. While people still were pulling into the parking lot around 8 a.m., there was no frantic rush for groceries. Younger shoppers also could be seen walking into the Fells Point Safeway at 8 a.m., despite the senior- and vulnerable population-specific shopping hours. At least one younger shopper wore a mask and there were clear attempts inside the store to practice some amount of social distancing. Eric Welsh, 59, stopped at the Safeway to stock up on a few things, particularly Diet Coke. As he loaded up his vehicle, he said he was frustrated by the number of younger shoppers. While the shopping experience itself wasn’t a hassle, with only a few shelves that needed to be restocked, he said he wanted to see the policy enforced more. Asked whether he felt retailers would self-police and try to keep younger adults away, he pointed to another man in the parking lot who appeared younger than him. "Apparently not," he said. A Safeway representative said the grocer is relying on customers to be mindful about when they shop. “We’re not going to be enforcing the program so much as we’re appealing to our customers to respect the hours and really think about those in need,” spokeswoman Beth Goldberg said.

Bel Air, Edgewood ZIP codes account for nearly half of Harford County’s coronavirus cases
.W
Most of Harford County’s 142 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus reported Monday have been concentrated in the central part of the county, according to ZIP code data released by the state this week. Bel Air's two ZIP codes, 21014 and 21015 make up a combined 40 cases, with the 21040 Edgewood ZIP code accounting for another 30. The communities of Abingdon (14), Forest Hill (13) and Joppa (12) also had enough cases to be reported by the state. Data for ZIP codes with seven or fewer cases is suppressed, according to the state’s coronavirus website. This is due to privacy laws, said Molly Mraz, a spokesperson for the Harford County Health Department. “If we identified cases less than seven in the ZIP codes, it could be easy to identify a person who was positive,” she said. “You could potentially identify someone if you identified case numbers less than seven in the ZIP code based on the information that is already being collected by the State of Maryland.” Mraz warned that because a resident’s ZIP code isn’t listed, it doesn’t mean there aren’t any any cases of COVID-19 there, and it’s important to continue social distancing. “COVID-19 is actively being spread throughout the Harford County area and we are stressing as best we can to stay home, practice social distancing, and if you must go out for essentials, to please use a cloth facemask,” she said. “Wash your hands often and if you do not have access to soap and water, use hand sanitizer. The only way we will slow the spread in Harford County is by staying at home.” There have been no COVID-19 related deaths in Harford County thus far. It is the hardest-hit jurisdiction in Maryland as far as confirmed cases without a death related to the respiratory virus. Across Maryland, there have been 8,936 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 262 deaths, according to Department of Health data through Monday morning. There have been 42,815 negative test results; 1,975 hospitalizations related to the illness and 603 patients released from isolation since the state began tracking the data in early March. Harford County confirmed cases by ZIP Code: 21040 (Edgewood) - 30 21015 (Bel Air South) - 23 21014 (Bel Air North) - 17 21009 (Abingdon) - 14 21050 (Forest Hill) - 13 21085 (Joppa) - 12 21001 (Aberdeen) - 0 21005 (APG North) - 0 21010 (APG South) - 0 21013 (Baldwin) - 0 21017 (Belcamp) - 0 21028 (Churchville) - 0 21034 (Darlington) - 0 21047 (Fallston) - 0 21078 (Havre de Grace) - 0 21084 (Jarrettsville) - 0 21087 (Kingsville) - 0 21132 (Pylesville) - 0 21154 (Street) - 0 21160 (Whiteford) - 0 21161 (White Hall) - 0 Note: The Maryland Department of Health is suppressing data for ZIP codes with seven or fewer confirmed cases.

35th annual Al Cesky Scholarship Fund banquet canceled due to uncertainty over coronavirus
.W
The Al Cesky Scholarship Fund’s annual scholarship banquet and golf tournament have both been canceled this year because of continued uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic. The 24 scholarships will still be awarded this year to student-athletes, the foundation announced late last week. The winners will be announced in early May. “This was not an easy decision for us,” Bob McCone, president of the Cesky scholarship Fund, said. “These students are so deserving of their awards, we want to see them recognized. But we don’t know what’s coming in the next few weeks and months, so we can’t move forward.” Besides creating a national health emergency, COVID-19 has taken a toll on the local business community. “Because of the coronavirus, the economic situation is really serious, with no relief in sight for our businesses,” McCone said. “It’s difficult to ask businesses struggling themselves, that have been partners with us for 35 years, for their money. They need their money at this time also.” Each year, 24 graduating high school student-athletes, a male and female representing Harford County's 12 senior classes, are honored at the Annual ACSF Awards Banquet. A male and female from among those student-athletes receive $5,000 to help defray the cost of their post-secondary education, while the remaining 22 winners each receive $2,000 scholarships for a combined total of $54,000 each year. Nominations are based on the student's academic and athletic achievement as well as demonstrated leadership, community service experience and financial need. Selection committees within the individual schools nominate the 24 scholarship recipients. The ACSF selection committee anonymously reviews the applications and selects the two $5,000 winners. The 35th annual banquet, which also serves as a fundraiser, had been scheduled for May 20 at Richlin Ballroom, which is closed as Harford residents are strongly urged to stay at home while public gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited. Board members are still considering how to award the scholarships, but said it depends if and when school resumes for the year. Were school to resume, the scholarships could be presented at the senior awards ceremonies. Banquet booklets, which includes each student’s name and biographical information, will still be printed so the students have something to commemorate their award. Regardless of how the scholarships are presented, the Al Cesky Scholarship Fund Inc. is committed to honoring its financial commitment to the winners. The 31st annual golf tournament had been scheduled for July at Maryland Golf and Country Clubs. The fund’s biggest fundraiser typically generates a considerable amount to be used toward scholarships. The Susquehanna River Running Festival is still on schedule for Sept. 26. A decision on the half-marathon, 10K and 5K will be made early this summer, “but for now we’re still planning the event as if it’s going to happen,” McCone said. Donations to the Al Cesky Scholarship Fund can be made at alceskyscholarship.org.

Nearly 400 people tested at Carroll Hospital, fifth coronavirus case confirmed in Carroll County
.W
Carroll Hospital has tested nearly 400 people for the coronavirus and, so far, five people from Carroll County, ranging in age from 20s to 60s have tested positive. Testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, began at the hospital emergency department in February, according to Selena Mowery, hospital spokesperson. Mowery said Monday that 388 samples had been sent to Lab Corps in New York, 262 of which were obtained via drive-through testing, which began March 12. The hospital is sending tests to New York because labs closer to home are full, according to Mowery. “We can’t send tests to a lab in Baltimore because those labs cannot handle additional capacity,” she said. So Carroll Hospital chose Lab Corps, with which it already had a partnership, Mowery said. However, the the hospital is not the only facility in Carroll County taking samples. Maggie Kunz, public information officer for Carroll County Health Department, said private medical providers are offering tests, too. The 388 are merely tests done at Carroll Hospital. “Probably the [total] number is a little bit higher," Kunz said. Initially, labs were only required to report positive tests to the health department, Kunz said, until the Maryland Secretary of Health issued a new order Monday requiring all COVID-19 tests, including negative results, to be reported to the Maryland Department of Health. “I think we will see soon a big change in how tests are being offered," Kunz said. Local public health and hospital officials have been seeking ways to expand testing capability in Carroll County. Gov. Larry Hogan said March 13 the federal government has been unable to keep up with testing. The number of coronavirus cases in Carroll County increased by two over the weekend as the fourth and fifth cases were announced by the county health department Monday morning. The fourth person found with the coronavirus is a woman in her 60s who is recovering at home, according to Kunz. The woman did not have any known contact with someone who has COVID-19, and this case is not associated with foreign travel, Kunz said. The health department learned of the fourth case late Sunday evening. The fifth case is a woman in her 40s who is also recovering at home, according to Kunz. The case is not associated with travel and the woman had no known contact with an infected person, Kunz said. A man in his 40s, a woman in her 30s, and a man in his 20s were the first, second, and third cases announced in Carroll. The man in his 40s is related to the woman in her 30s. “They’re all still at home and doing well," Kunz said at about 10 a.m. Monday. Testing for COVID-19 is moving along in Carroll, according to Kunz, though she knows there is some lag in getting supplies for testing kits nationwide. The Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, 410-876-4848, is seeing a steady number of calls. Over the weekend, they received about 40 calls each day and typically receive twice that on weekdays, Kunz said. A small number of people who called this weekend were recommended for testing, though she did not know how many. The hotline is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Anyone who is sick should contact their doctor. At least 288 people have confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state, Hogan announced Monday morning. Three Marylanders have died from the disease, he said.

Our View: Thumbs up for Carroll County creativity in face of coronavirus, Keymar blood drive
.W
THUMBS UP: No one has a complete playbook for how to best handle the coronavirus pandemic we’re all doing our best to deal with. Some have more essential supplies than others, sure, but the widespread disruption caused by COVID-19 is unprecedented and dangerous for many. That said, there are plenty of Carroll County companies and nonprofits that are doing a standout job at navigating the crisis with creativity and generosity. Here are just a few. Local Homestead Products LLC, an on-farm market in New Windsor, is not only continuing to operate, but is also helping other Carroll businesses to do so. The businesses, by Trevor and Victoria Hoff, has become a hub for local businesses to sell some of their products. The variety of local businesses includes Uncle Matty’s in New Windsor, Molli’s Cafe in Westminster, Starry Night bakery in Westminster and Whispering Breeze in Taneytown. And it wasn’t a big task, Victoria told us. “Our market is based around local businesses even before all of this started, so a lot of the local restaurants bought produce from us, of course, the things that we were growing. So our relationship was kind of already opened up through us supplying them with produce,” she said. It’s an approach that seems to work well for the market, the other small businesses and the consumer. Two Carroll distilleries are participating in a trend that is providing hand sanitizer in a time when it’s very much in demand. MISCellaneous Distillery in Mount Airy and Patapsco Distilling Company in Sykesville have shifted gears to begin making the product. It’s surely not what they would be preferring to do, but it’s extremely good of them to do — and probably makes good business sense, too. They were well equipped to produce the alcohol needed to begin with, so we’re all for it. There’s no question that there are parts of the population especially vulnerable to not just the coronavirus, but the ripples it has sent throughout our society as well. And the agencies and nonprofits that serve many of those more vulnerable individuals are working hard to find ways to continue services, while keeping everyone involved healthy and safe. The Shepherd’s Staff is continuing with its other services as best as possible on an appointment-only basis. Some of their usual services, such as emergency financial assistance with rent, are not needed at this moment thanks to Hogan’s halting evictions and water shutoffs, but there’s no question that most of their services will be needed in a big way in the months ahead. Carroll County Food Sunday is also working to provide essential services while keeping everyone involved, a task that is proving difficult. It doesn’t help that a significant chunk of the food bank’s clients are food-insecure seniors, who are particularly at risk for the coronavirus. On two days this past week, though, they did distribute shelf-stable, nonperishable foods from the East Middle School parking lot. Access Carroll, which provides health and dental care to low-income people, has continued to operate, though they started screening anyone entering the building for symptoms of the coronavirus. And their regular appointments, as much as possible, are being conducted through remote video sessions. Human Services Programs of Carroll County Inc., which operates Carroll’s emergency and homeless shelters, including the cold weather shelter, is also staying open. HSP staff are meeting with people for services such as rapid rehousing, and they are also going out to homeless encampments and touching base with people. Department of Social Services programs — such as SNAP benefits, child support services and home energy assistance — are still functioning, but anyone who needs help can call 1-800-332-6347 or visit www.mydhrbenefits.dhr.state.md.us. THUMBS UP: The American Red Cross has put out a call for help, and a Keymar church answered that call. The coronavirus pandemic is forcing an “unprecedented” number of blood drive cancellations, leading to a severe blood shortage. According to a Red Cross spokesperson, as of Sunday there were 6,500 blood drives canceled nationwide, resulting in more than 200,000 uncollected units of blood. While others were canceling, Keysville Evangelical Lutheran Church held a blood drive March 23, and turnout was strong. According to organizer Rebecca Engel, this drive had more registered participants than they’ve ever seen at one. “People have called and wanted to give, that we don’t usually have on the schedule,” she told us. It might not be front of mind for many people, but donated blood can be an essential need for many, and it’s essential for the survival of others that we all keep that in mind amid this shortage, which is likely to end up being historic. Of course, the Red Cross has implemented measures to ensure blood drives and donation centers keep both donors and staff safe during the pandemic, and the church followed those new measures.

Does Maryland have a plan to protect primary voters from coronavirus? | READER COMMENTARY

When I read the article, “Maryland now testing seven patients for coronavirus; still no confirmed cases” (March 3), I couldn’t help but wonder what Maryland officials’ plans are for voting in the age of coronavirus. One certainly hopes that officials also have a plan to protect voters in April — and, should it come to it, in November — in a way that does not dampen voter turnout or fuel further infection.

Confirmed coronavirus cases in Maryland jump by 484, death toll now at 67, officials say
.W
Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Maryland have increased to at least 3,609 Sunday, with the death toll now at 67, officials said. Maryland added 484 cases and 14 deaths since Saturday. Almost 25,000 people have tested negative for COVID-19 and 936 have been hospitalized. Sixteen additional confirmed cases have arisen in Prince George’s County, which leads the state with 785 confirmed cases. Montgomery County has seen thirteen additional cases since Saturday, giving it a total of 693 confirmed cases. Eight confirmed cases have been added in Carroll County (142), seven in Baltimore (394), six each in Baltimore County (590) and Anne Arundel County (319), three apiece in Howard County (199) and Frederick County (112) and one in Wicomico County (11). The Maryland Department of Health on Sunday afternoon released additional information for the 14 deaths announced: A Baltimore woman in her 30s; two Baltimore County men, one in his 50s and the other in his 70s; two Carrol County women, one in her 60s and the other over 80; one Charles County women in her 70s; one Frederick County man in his 70s; four Montgomery County men, two in their 70s and one each in his 30s and 50s; and three Prince George’s County residents, two men over 80 and the other in his 70s, and a woman in her 70s. The department did not release information regarding whether the victims had underlying medical conditions. The increase in confirmed cases comes the morning after the Baltimore Police Southwest District was closed following one officer testing positive for COVID-19. All officers assigned to the Southwest District were ordered to self-quarantine for 14 days, state department officials said late Saturday. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan declared a “moment of prayer and reflection” at noon Sunday for those who have died from the coronavirus, along with the medical workers and first responders on the front lines of addressing the pandemic. “Maryland unites in solemn respect and gratitude to pay homage to those who so courageously continue to do all that is within their power to heal and support our nation during this pandemic,” read a proclamation Hogan signed. This story will be updated.

Maryland Chief Judge Barbera encourages release of at-risk prisoners amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Maryland Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera late Tuesday ordered trial courts to identify and release prisoners statewide who are at-risk for the coronavirus and pose no threat to public safety. With her order, Barbera opens the door for prisoners to be released on a case-by-case basis. “With careful regard for the safety of victims and communities in general; with respect for the statutory rights of victims; and with due consideration given to public health concerns related to inmates who may have contracted COVID-19,” she wrote. In addition, she closed courts statewide through June 5. Her order affirms efforts by prosecutors and public defenders of some jurisdictions who have already set about identifying and releasing vulnerable inmates, Maryland Public Defender Paul DeWolfe said through a spokeswoman. And the order will hasten efforts in jurisdictions that have not taken action, he said. “We have been raising concerns about COVID-19’s impact on our clients since the coronavirus outbreak started, and we are encouraged by the Chief Judge invoking her leadership to call for the decarceration needed to stem this public health crisis,” DeWolfe said. Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said she was pleased by the order but echoed her calls for Gov. Larry Hogan to invoke his authority and grant widespread clemency. “Marylanders must be aware that this process is slow, involves a case by case assessment, and is in no way a substitute for the swift and decisive action the Governor can take,” she said in a statement Tuesday night. “The fact that he has chosen not to do so, when the courts, the Attorney General, prosecutors, defenders, doctors, and families, are crying out for action — and so many other Governors have taken such steps — is disconcerting. For the sake of everyone in the state, I hope that he decides to act.” A spokesman for Hogan did not immediately respond Tuesday night. Barbera’s order comes after weeks of calls from public health officials, advocates for prison reform, inmates and their families for the release of nonviolent offenders. They have warned that the men and women locked up in Maryland’s prisons are in danger of a deadly outbreak behind bars. The virus has infected more than 9,400 people in Maryland and killed more than 300. Prisoners live together in close quarters, making precautions such as social distancing difficult. As the outbreak worsens, many prisoners have grown increasingly concerned about their safety. One inmate, Travis Gary, told The Sun he fashioned a face mask out of long johns. Further, inmates and their families have said they feel the guards are not taking precautions to keep them safe. On Saturday, a prisoner in his 60s died at the Jessup Correctional Institution of coronavirus. Prison officials declined to identify the man. The virus has infected more than 90 prison guards, staff and inmates in Maryland, according to the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. Mosby has repeatedly called on Hogan to free all inmates over the age of 60 in state prisons, as well as anyone approved for parole and all inmates scheduled to complete their sentences within the next year. She has asked the governor to release them under supervision. Nearly a month ago, Mosby announced she would cease prosecuting anyone arrested for possessing drugs including heroin, attempted distribution of any drug, prostitution, trespassing, minor traffic offenses, open container and urinating in public. Mosby said she would forgo these prosecutions to help keep prison populations down during the pandemic. Hogan answered her request, initially, by saying prisoners are safer behind bars. More than 200 Johns Hopkins University public health faculty and staff have also asked the governor to take preventative measures in Maryland’s prisons, jails and detention centers. The virus has hit hard such facilities around the country. At the Cook County Jail in Chicago, the virus has infected 185 detainees and killed three people, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office. The office has also counted 189 correctional officers infected by the virus. An outbreak of coronavirus in New York prisons, including Rikers Island jail, has sickened hundreds of guards and inmates, attracting much attention. New York officials have set about releasing inmates older than 50 and others suffering health problems. The Office of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has said more than 1,500 people have been released, including 329 people serving time for violent, felony crimes. State and city leaders around the country are left to balance efforts to reduce prison populations while ensuring public safety. Outside of the Baltimore City Correctional Center last week, inmates could be heard shouting through open windows about their fear of the virus. The American Civil Liberties Union has petitioned for such prisoners to be released, saying reluctance to do so is a “blind spot” in Maryland leadership. Sonia Kumar, an attorney with the ACLU of Maryland, noted the prisoner’s death Saturday and urged trial courts to quickly follow Barber’s order. “There is still time to save others,” Kumar said. “There are men and women in their 60s and 70s and those with underlying medical conditions who can safely be released who have loved ones ready to welcome them home. Every branch of government should be working together to expedite getting them out.” Also, the Maryland courts announced Monday measures to reduce the number of juveniles held in detention centers. Barbera, the chief judge, ordered lower courts to identify juvenile offenders who can be safely released. She ordered the judges to limit their decisions to send youth to detention centers. And if a judge must make such a decision, he or she must give justification on the record. So far, youth have tested positive for the virus at the Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, the Lower Eastern Shore Children’s Center in Salisbury, and the Alfred D. Noyes Children Center in Montgomery County, state officials say.

7 more coronavirus deaths in Maryland brings total to at least 22, officials say
.W
Seven more Marylanders have died from the new coronavirus, officials said Tuesday, bringing the total number of deaths in the state to at least 22. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Maryland has risen to at least 1,660 as of Tuesday, the day after Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order requiring residents to stay at home except for essential activities, state officials said. Tuesday’s total represented an additional 247 cases in the state, an 18% increase over the previous day. Three of the most recent deaths include two men in their 80s — one from Carroll County, the other from Howard — both with underlying health conditions, as well as a Prince George’s County man in his 40s without underlying health issues, according Hogan’s spokesman. Carroll County officials announced that three more residents at the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy died from COVID-19, bringing the total to five deaths at the facility after an outbreak. The residents who died Tuesday were two men in their 70s and a woman in her 60s, each with underlying conditions, the Carroll County Health Department said. Another victim was a woman in her 70s, was the third Baltimore resident to die from the acute respiratory disease, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced Tuesday. Young said the woman’s death is a “tragic reminder” of the danger of the new coronavirus. He urged residents to stay home and take the disease seriously. “This is our chance to save lives in our city,” he said. Hogan reiterated the need for more protective supplies for health care workers and more tests in an appearance on CNN on Tuesday morning. “Without the tests, we really are flying blind," Hogan said. “We are really guessing where the outbreaks are.” Montgomery and Prince George’s counties continue to lead the state in known cases Tuesday with 388 and 341, respectively. Baltimore County had 227, Baltimore City had 187, Anne Arundel County had 127, Howard County had 117, Carroll County had 92, Charles County had 40, Frederick County had 33 and Harford County had 25, the state said. Of those confirmed to have the disease, 335 were in their 50s; 304 were in their 40s; 290 were in their 30s; 260 were in their 60s; 215 were in their 20s; 157 were in their 70s, and 32 were ages 10-19, the state said. Sixty-one of those with confirmed cases were older than 80 and six were younger than 9. Women represent 856 of the patients, and the other 804 are men, according to the state. The number of negative coronavirus tests administered in Maryland has reached 14,868, and 53 people have been released from isolation, state officials said. The D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area had 2,709 confirmed cases as of Monday and is likely to face a similar wave of cases to the New York area, which has had nearly 1,000 deaths, Hogan said. Baltimore Sun reporters Pamela Wood, Talia Richman and McKenna Oxenden contributed to this article.

Howard County announces fewer than a dozen negative coronavirus tests; libraries, senior centers to close
.W
The Howard County Health Department has performed fewer than a dozen tests for the new coronavirus, all of which have come back negative, health officials said Friday. County officials hosted a second news conference regarding coronavirus updates Friday to update residents on postponed and canceled events and limited county resources. As of 2 p.m. Friday, there are 18 cases of the coronavirus in Maryland; none of the affected are county residents. Howard County Health Officer Maura Rossman said the number of tests performed by the health department is not the total number that have been done in the county because tests could have been administered at Quest and LabCorp, two private labs that announced over the course of the last week that they would have testing capabilities. “Any provider in the state of Maryland now can collect a specimen from a patient that they think should have [COVID-19] testing and can send that specimen to LabCorp or Quest,” Rossman said. “We are preparing for cases of hospital surge if needed.” She also emphasized, like many health officials, that people should avoid at-risk areas and at-risk people, noting the importance of not stigmatizing individuals that may be more susceptible to the virus. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday night that Maryland public schools will be closed March 16-27. The Howard County Library System will shut down libraries beginning Monday through March 27. The library system is waiving late fees and is asking residents to not return items in order to prevent the potential spread of the coronavirus. At close of business Friday, all 50+ centers in the county will also be closed through March 27. “Most of our concentration has been on preparing for the event that eventually we will have a patient who has tested positive for COVID-19, and we’re also working on screening patients who are concerned about that at the moment,” said Dr. Shafeeq Ahmed, chief medical officer at Howard County General Hospital. Ahmed also said they are “judiciously” using equipment to get to the patients that need it the most. There is a tent set up outside the hospital, but it is not operational yet. Ahmed said the hospital is working on plans for potentially screening patients in the tent. Nationwide, there have been questions and concerns regarding the availability of tests and where individuals can go to get a test. All testing had previously been done at the Maryland Department of Health until LabCorp or Quest announced testing capabilities in some states, including Maryland. Rossman also said the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University were working to develop their own tests. “It’s impossible to know at this point [how many tests are being done] because the tests are being done in a variety of different places and we’re really only concentrating on the positives,” Rossman said. County Executive Calvin Ball also announced the residents’ budget hearing that was canceled Thursday will be held online at 6 p.m. March 30. “We’re closely monitoring this rapidly evolving situation,” Ball said Friday.

Johns Hopkins introduces new restrictions on hospital visitors amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Johns Hopkins Medicine on Saturday introduced new restrictions on visitors to its medical facilities in an effort to protect patients and staff from the spread of the novel coronavirus. It joins other hospital networks regionally and across the country in doing so. Effective Saturday, no visitors will be allowed at adult inpatient facilities, except under a select set of circumstances, Hopkins said. Only two visitors at a time will be allowed to visit patients receiving end-of-life care. “Other family members need to remain outside of the facility to rotate in special circumstances,” it said. For labor and delivery and post-partum care, only one visitor will be allowed, in addition to a doula. For patients in hospice units, awaiting discharge, or undergoing emergency surgery after a traumatic event, a single visitor will be allowed. One visitor also will be allowed in instances where a patient’s care team has requested the visitor be part of a family training event for patients receiving rehabilitation or who have special cognitive needs, Hopkins said. Two visitors who are parents or legal guardians will be allowed to accompany patients in pediatric inpatient facilities, but the system asked that families keep it to one primary caregiver in the facility “as much as possible.” Pediatric patients with the coronavirus will only be allowed one caregiver, “who should stay with the patient in the room during the patient’s stay.” For outpatient facilities, a single visitor will be permitted to accompany a patient “to facilitate care or treatment,” but visitors will not be allowed in cancer infusion suites. Visitors approved under the above circumstances will be screened for flu-like symptoms “and will not be able to stay if symptomatic.” “We encourage family, friends and loved ones to use electronic devices and apps to keep in contact with patients,” the hospital network said.

VEIP facility in Forest Hill opens for physician-approved coronavirus testing
.W
The drivers slowly rolled up to the testing lanes at the VEIP facility in Forest Hill on Wednesday, but rather than getting an inspection of the emissions from their vehicles, the occupants were being tested themselves to confirm if they have COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The facility on Robin Circle is one of three Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program stations, along with those in Glen Burnie and Charles County, that opened for COVID-19 testing Wednesday. The sites are not open for the general public — people must make an appointment to get a test and can only do so after a health care provider determines they meet the criteria for one and issues an order for testing, according to the Maryland Department of Health. "We are focused on testing people who really need it and by using these sites, we can allow them to be tested away from busy emergency rooms, urgent care centers and physicians’ offices,” Fran Phillips, the state’s deputy secretary of public health, said in a statement. “People with no symptoms or who are mildly ill do not need testing," Phillips added. "Most people who get this virus can recover at home with rest, fluids and over-the-counter fever reducers.” The process for testing, in that only patients who have been referred by a physician can get a test, is the same process used by University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health when the health system started drive-up testing in the parking lot of Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air on March 13, according to UCH spokesperson Martha Mallonee. Approximately 50 people per day are being tested, she said. The Bel Air hospital is one of two in Harford County operated by UCH; Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace is the second. Upper Chesapeake Health is operating the testing program at the Forest Hill VEIP station in partnership with the Harford County Health Department. Testing is available Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; the VEIP facility is at 1631 Robin Circle. “We’re just so appreciative to be a part of the testing and to be partnering with Upper Chesapeake and the Maryland Department of Health,” Molly Mraz, a spokesperson for the county health department, said while at the testing facility Wednesday afternoon. Harford County has 34 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Wednesday morning; there have not been any deaths from the disease, which can be fatal, in Harford yet, according to Mraz. There were 1,985 confirmed cases throughout Maryland as of Wednesday, she said. Patients turned into the VEIP facility driveway where they were greeted by an Upper Chesapeake Health representative who wore a face mask as he talked with the driver. Maryland State Police troopers, who were in their patrol vehicles with the emergency lights flashing, also were on hand near the facility entrance. Local media had been invited to observe the testing process, but patients could not talk with reporters while at the VEIP site, as state health officials had emphasized ahead of time the need to protect patient privacy in accordance with federal HIPPA laws. The patients proceeded to the testing area where nurses with UCH’s HealthLink Community Outreach checked them in and administered the tests using nasal swabs while patients remained in their vehicles. The nurses were wearing protective gear such as face masks, gloves and gowns over their clothing. They took off their gloves, rubbed their hands with sanitizer and put on new gloves between each test. Mallonee, who also was on site Wednesday, noted the nurses could not remove the rest of their gear while testing was happening, though. Mallonee emphasized that patients must have approval from a physician, either in private practice or at a ChoiceOne urgent care clinic, before getting a COVID-19 test through Upper Chesapeake Health. ChoiceOne, which has clinics in Aberdeen, Fallston and Forest Hill, is part of the UCH system. Doctors and providers at Choice One have strict criteria for who qualifies for testing, Mallonee said. More information can be found at www.umms.org/coronavirus/test. Doctors make their assessments based on each patient’s symptoms and whether they have other underlying health issues that make them more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus, plus other factors such as where they work and their travel history, according to Mallonee. COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan, China, has become a global pandemic. The doctor then sets up the appointment for testing. The test is conducted and the sample is sent to a lab for analysis — it takes three to 10 days before results are available. The lab then sends the test results to the physician, according to Mallonee, who noted Upper Chesapeake is “really just an extension of the doctor’s office” in terms of testing. People can visit umuch.org/veiptesting for more information about the coronavirus tests, as well as how UCH is handling the pandemic. The county health department keeps up to date with confirmed COVID-19 cases through the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System, or NEDSS. Electronic reports from various labs are entered into NEDSS, and health department nurses check if anyone who has tested positive for the disease is a Harford County resident. The state, as well as local health officials, check NEDSS daily and update the number of cases each morning, according to Mraz. Upper Chesapeake has implemented significant restrictions on visitation at its hospitals, the same as other hospitals in the University of Maryland Medical System and other health systems around the state and nation, plus UMMS instituted a two-week delay of elective surgeries and “routine, non-urgent” medical appointments at its facilities to help slow the spread of coronavirus. The health system is working to facilitate communication between patients and their loved ones through multiple electronic devices while patients stay in the hospitals, Mallonee noted Wednesday. She said the drive-up COVID-19 testing program is a way to keep people who could be infected with the disease out of the hospital. “The real goal is to make sure everyone is safe,” Mallonee said.

Maryland patients contracted coronavirus in Egypt, met with students outside Philadelphia and others in Rockville
.W
The three people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus this week were on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River, said Gov. Larry Hogan, who shared more details during a Friday evening news conference about the Montgomery County residents, the first confirmed cases in Maryland. The three — a couple in their 70s and an unrelated woman in her 50s — are currently isolated in their homes and their symptoms are abating. Five of their family members have been advised to be tested and officials continue to trace their contacts with others to determine if more people should also be tested, said Fran Phillips, deputy state health secretary for public health during the news conference. One of the patients traveled to suburban Philadelphia and met with students and others there, which resulted in Pennsylvania health officials deciding to temporarily close five Bucks County schools. Another of the patients attended a Feb. 28 event at The Village at Rockville, a retirement community. Health officials say 70 to 100 residents, visitors and staff at the event may be at risk for COVID-19. They are urging them to monitor for symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing until March 13. They should also take their temperature twice a day and notify their health care provider if it’s greater than 100.4 or they have other symptoms. Anyone who attended the Feb. 28 event is encouraged to contact their physician or the Maryland Emergency Management Agency call center at 410-517-3720. “We’re obviously concerned, we’re not getting any sleep and the information is coming at us pretty fast and furious,” Hogan said during the conference. Hogan announced the three positive tests Thursday evening and then declared a state of emergency, allowing Maryland to mobilize its emergency operations center and ramp up its coordination with local and federal agencies. In addition to the three confirmed cases in the state, eight tests are still pending among the 44 tests conducted. One person under investigation is at University of Maryland St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson, the hospital confirmed Friday. It’s unknown where the others are located or if they are hospitalized or isolated at home as they await results. Specimens collected by hospitals are now sent to the state lab in East Baltimore, which has 1,000 testing kits on hand to test more residents, Phillips said. The respiratory disease has sickened more than 100,000 across the globe and killed more than 3,300. Hogan said the Maryland cases are related to six others confirmed in Texas. News reports from Houston say six people there contracted the coronavirus after going on a Nile River cruise in Egypt. Dr. Travis Gayles, the chief health officer for Montgomery County, said the three people returned to Maryland on Feb. 20 and were tested this week for COVID-19 after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the criteria for testing. The CDC initially restricted testing to people with symptoms who had traveled or come in direct contact with someone infected. The guidance has now been expanded but test kits remain limited. “The three cases involved here are doing well clinically and for the most part their symptoms have abated,” Gayles said. Officials did not release their names or where in Montgomery County the three live or initially where they contracted the coronavirus, out of concern for their privacy. Officials also have not identified the hospitals where the patients were treated and where else they traveled or airports they used, a lack of information that drew criticism on social media Friday. Across the country, health officials have not named any of the individuals who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 because that information would violate federal privacy laws. However, other states and cities have provided much more precise details about their travels, such as New York state and Chicago. Meanwhile, state lawmakers continue to move funding for preparedness forward, though officials have not detailed where all the money will be spent. The Senate gave final approval to Hogan’s bill that would allow him to use up to $50 million from the state’s rainy day fund for coronavirus response. The House of Delegates followed suit Friday night, unanimously fast-tracking the bill and sending it to the governor’s desk for him to sign into law. Maryland Sen. Bill Ferguson urged lawmakers to practice good hygiene and reminded them that additional hand sanitizer stations have been installed throughout the State House complex in Annapolis. Ferguson also reminded senators to get and share information from trusted sources, such as the CDC and the Maryland Department of Health. Ferguson said it was not likely that the coronavirus would affect the General Assembly, which is scheduled to be in session through early April. “This body and this chamber has not recessed early or adjourned early since the Civil War and so there is no reason whatsoever to think this year would be any different," said Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat. Other events have been canceled in the region and nationally, as more people are expected to test positive for the virus because more people are being tested. Johns Hopkins University closed a basketball tournament it was hosting to spectators to prevent spread of the virus, for example, and a women’s expo planned at an Inner Harbor hotel this weekend was canceled. More than 300 Americans are infected and 14 have died. The latest people to test positive are 21 who are aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship that is being held off the coast of California, said Vice President Mike Pence, who’s in charge of the federal response, during a Friday news conference. The numbers are expected to keep climbing. Pence said private labs should be able to conduct tests next week, in addition to every state lab. Earlier Friday, lawmakers on Capitol Hill heard from experts from Johns Hopkins University about the continuing shortage of tests, as well as other issues with preparedness. The United States currently does not have enough tests for all citizens who have symptoms of the coronavirus, and a significant rise in cases could put “substantial pressure” on hospital intensive-care units across the country, the Hopkins experts said. Quest Diagnostics and other private clinical laboratories are working to develop their own tests, and while more widespread testing likely will confirm more cases, it’s also likely to lower the percentage of fatal cases, said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “We need to continue to substantially expand diagnostic testing,” Inglesby said. “The goal is to get to a point where any patient who has symptoms of the coronavirus can be tested. … We don’t have the bandwidth to do that now.” A vaccine for COVID-19 could be a year to 18 months away “if all goes well,” he said. “We should be developing plans for mass manufacture of the vaccine when it is developed,” Inglesby said. Baltimore Sun Media Group reporters Liz Bowie, Cody Boteler, Luke Broadwater and Jean Marbella contributed to this article.

Before reopening, Maryland needs army of workers to hunt for coronavirus cases by contact tracing
.W
As Maryland officials work on a plan to ease restrictions that already have kept residents home for weeks, they are not only seeking to isolate those who test positive for the COVID-19 infection but bring on an army of workers to identify anyone who may have been exposed to the coronavirus. The state now has about 200 to 250 so-called contact tracers on the job at local health departments, but that force will need to be multiplied, said Fran Phillips, deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Health. The job isn’t easy; such workers must find everyone an infected person has been in contact with and seek to isolate them until they’re either confirmed infected or not. “We’re going to be doing contact tracing. We’re going to be doing that until we have a vaccine," she said. "This is not a short-term project. This is going to be sustained work.” Isolation, contact tracing and widespread testing will be crucial elements to reopening businesses and schools and allowing people to leave home eventually. If people with COVID-19 and those potentially infected are quarantined, infections will slow and restrictions could be eased for everyone else, said Crystal Watson, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. She co-authored a new report that outlines the necessity of tracing for reopening society. Each person with COVID-19 infects an average of two or three people, according to the report. The report for the first time estimated what will be needed nationwide: a workforce of 100,000 tracers at a one-year cost of about $3.6 billion. “Before we make consequential decisions about reducing social distancing measures, we need to have them in place," Watson said. “This is our best estimate of what we think is the need,” she added. “It’s a good place to start.” The basic idea of testing, tracing and quarantining has been embraced by many public health officials and governors, including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. State officials announced last week that the state is partnering with the University of Maryland School of Medicine on a testing initiative that could do up to 20,000 tests a day. Phillips said there are now about 3,000 tests conducted a day in Maryland, but the number is increasing by about 5% a day. “We need to triple that at least," she said. “We need to have testing readily available without charge to whoever needs it. It needs to be everywhere. It needs to be rapid.” At the same time, she said the state must ramp up its workforce to be able to do contact tracing of those who test positive. To multiply the workers, she suggested unemployed Marylanders could be trained. She could not estimate how long it would take to hire and train such a workforce or how big it would be eventually, but suggested federal funding could be used to support the workers. Watson said hiring and training could take at least a month or two. Ideally, the workers would be coordinated at the federal level, but absent that, states would have to take the lead and coordinate within their borders and with one another. Some coordination efforts are underway already. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a regional partnership Monday among Northeast governors on an eventual reopening. California and other Westerns states also said they were coordinating efforts. Maryland has been coordinating its response with neighbors Washington, D.C., and Virginia, though they have no formal pact. “I think it’s a really good idea, the regional cooperation,” Hogan said Monday during a CNN interview with host Anderson Cooper. None of the governors have said when they believe restrictions can be lifted. They said, however, the decisions would be theirs, contradicting statements by President Donald Trump that he has the “total” authority to order states to lift restrictions. While Hogan said he would “love” to have the president’s cooperation, it was the governors who enacted restrictions such as closing schools and businesses and ordering people to stay home, and it will be governors who decide when to reverse those restrictions. Members of the governor’s coronavirus task force have said several things need to happen before then. That includes a sustained period of declining COVID-19 cases and enough hospital capacity and protective gear for health workers in case of a second wave of cases. Such an easing of the state’s initial outbreak could be weeks if not a couple of months away. The group also said there needs to be widespread testing, which includes testing for new cases as well as testing for antibodies among those who were previously infected and may now enjoy some immunity. And then there are those tracers. Massachusetts is perhaps the state farthest along on tracing. Officials there have partnered with a nonprofit to hire 1,000 contact tracers. While the overall number of tracers Maryland needs isn’t clear yet, local health departments have begun to add staff. Baltimore County has moved 15 nurses and a supervisor from the school system to the health department, and some of them will trace those who have had contacts with confirmed cases. Watson said Baltimore City has been working with Hopkins to scale up its tracing, though no one in the city health department was available to comment. In Howard County, the health department has reassigned workers on the nursing and public health staffs to contact tracing to double its contact tracing workforce, said Dr. Jacqueline Douge, medical director in the Bureau of Health Services. The county now has eight tracers and is adding nine more this week, a county health spokeswoman said. So far, the department is keeping up with the demand the coronavirus poses, Douge said, but if large outbreaks occur or caseloads otherwise accelerate, more staff and resources to devote to contact tracing could be needed. “I think everybody would need more resources,” she said. The workers need to be trained and will likely use technology to trace people’s whereabouts, potentially through people’s smartphones. That way health officials can warn people who were in a grocery store or elsewhere at the same time as someone who later tested positive and order them to quarantine for 14 days. The tracing work can be intense, Douge said, sometimes requiring repeated calls to reach people who are in quarantine or may have been exposed to the virus. Some training is required to ensure that staff new to contact tracing are following the proper protocols to gauge exposure risks and ensure thorough investigation. The Hopkins report said the testing-tracing-quarantining plan has worked in other countries in past pandemics, and in China during this one. "This is what we’re seeing in countries that have been successful at controlling the virus,” Watson said. “It will really come down to that contact tracing ability and having people cooperate and stay home when they are sick and quarantined if they are exposed.” Baltimore Sun reporters Pamela Wood and Liz Bowie contributed to this article.

Baltimore Mayor Young: Evictions halted while schools are closed because of coronavirus
.W
The Baltimore sheriff’s office will stop evicting people from their homes while schools are closed due to concerns about the coronavirus, the mayor announced Thursday night. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, together with the city’s sheriff and a district judge, “put in place a policy to allow people to remain in their homes while schools and many other government buildings are closed due to COVID-19,” according to a news release. Maryland’s public schools are closing Monday for the next two weeks in an attempt to slow the spread of the new coronavirus that has already sickened some people in the state. That means nearly 80,000 Baltimore public school students, many from low-income families, will be kept at home. Young on Thursday requested that Baltimore City Sheriff John W. Anderson, who has jurisdiction over evictions, halt the practice during the time period when kids will be out of school. Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said in a statement that housing is a one of the core “social determinants of health that impacts the health, safety, and well-being of all of our residents.” She commended the city for limiting evictions during a critical time. Other cities across the country have ordered similar bans on evictions while they grapple with the pandemic.

Carroll County commissioner urges action to reopen Maryland’s economy from coronavirus restrictions
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan has implemented social distancing measures in order to limit the spread of the coronavirus. But some residents, as well as a Carroll County commissioner, are raising their voices in frustration over those measures and the resulting economic damage. Commissioner Eric Bouchat, R-District 4, wants to see healthy people return to work as soon as possible, though he acknowledged that a gradual opening is likely the best way to reopen business and other activity that has been shut down. Those who can’t work are hurting, he said. He fears jobless individuals will experience depression, anxiety, and turn to drug abuse or alcoholism. “The economic shutdown in the long term is going to do more harm to our society than the pandemic,” he said. Hogan said Wednesday social distancing measures — including a stay-at-home order for all Marylanders and the closure of nonessential businesses — are working and the state is now in a position to begin planning its recovery phase. The Republican governor said hospitalization rates are beginning to stabilize because of the "early and aggressive actions, and because of the extraordinary sacrifice of Marylanders.” And because of that, he said, plans for rolling back executive orders would begin to be revealed next week. "We’re now in a position to move from containment and mitigation to plan the gradual rollout of our recovery phase,” Hogan said. Bouchat also challenged Hogan’s authority to keep people from going to work and questioned whether an executive order would hold up in court. Mike Ricci, spokesperson for Hogan, said in an email Friday afternoon, “We are confident that the Governor’s stay-at-home order has a firm basis in law, and has the force of law, including provisions in the Public Safety article of the Maryland Code.” Ricci also mentioned Hogan’s Wednesday news conference in which he addressed the state’s aim to take a gradual approach. And in a Friday afternoon news conference, Hogan described himself as a “lifelong small businessman” and said he understands the frustration of small business owners and others unhappy with the extended closure of businesses and gatherings. “We’re going to have to do that in a safe manner,” the governor said. “I’m just as frustrated as they are.” Hogan also referred to a plan the White House detailed Thursday that advises against lifting restrictions until 14 days of coronavirus-related numbers going down. “Our numbers are all going up,” Hogan said. “So, no matter who you talk to, now is not the time to open things up.” On Thursday, President Donald Trump offered a three-phase approach to reopen the economy gradually, putting the decision of when in the hands of governors. COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has killed 35 people and infected 291 in Carroll County as of April 17, according to the health department. Statewide, the Maryland Department of Health has reported 11,572 coronavirus cases and 425 deaths. Commissioner Stephen Wantz, R-District 1, said he was on a conference call Thursday with Hogan and his staff. Wantz said the governor outlined four actions that need to take place before recovery can begin: Ensure hospitals and health care system are prepared for surge capacity.  Dramatically increase testing capabilities.  Have enough people to perform contact tracing, or finding and isolating anyone who might have come into contact with people who have contracted the virus.  Obtain an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, such as face masks and shields. Wantz said he supports gradual reopening and is following the governor’s lead. “For me it’s about ensuring we do it in the best way possible,” Wantz said Friday. “I’m just as anxious as anyone to be open.” He fears that lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a new spike in cases. “We can’t do it again, so we’ve got to do it right when we gradually reopen,” Wantz said. Some Marylanders are planning a protest in the state’s capital to push for a return to normalcy on May 1. The “ReOpen Maryland” protest is planned to occur in Annapolis on Saturday afternoon. According to a news release from organizers ReOpen Maryland and Marylanders Against Excessive Quarantine, thousands plan to peacefully protest starting at noon. “Government mandating sick people to stay home is called quarantine. However, the government mandating healthy citizens to stay home, forcing businesses and churches to close is called tyranny,” the release states. The commissioner said he supports the assembly but doesn’t plan to attend. He sees the protest as a manifestation of Marylanders’ frustration. “Those people’s voices need to be heard," Bouchat said. He would like to see those who could and feel safe doing so return to work, while the vulnerable remain at home. “Our policy is going to expand poverty and make us more susceptible to the spread and misery of coronavirus,” Bouchat said. Bouchat on Friday said he wrote six $100 checks to food pantries that serve his district. The commissioner is not alone in his concerns. Del. Warren Miller, a Republican representing parts of Carroll and Howard counties, penned a letter to Hogan on April 14 imploring him to plan the reopening of the economy. “The longer we delay a coordinated plan and communication of that plan, the more harm is being done to our constituents who want to work and our non-essential business owners that need to reopen,” Miller wrote. “To that end, I write to you today, so as to implore you to give those Marylanders facing hard decisions today some hope in the near future. Without a reasonable timeline for restarting the economy and without hope, irreversible business decisions are being made every day.” U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, who represents the Eastern Shore and parts of Carroll, Baltimore and Harford counties, said in a Facebook post, “In areas like the Eastern Shore, where the COVID threat is much lower, we should move expeditiously to re-open the economy.” Representatives of the business community have spoken up, too. A letter signed by 14 business entities was sent to Hogan and leaders of the Senate and House asking them for help. In the April 16 letter, they ask for one set of COVID-19 rules and regulations to eliminate confusion (though not a one-size-fits-all approach), for liability protection and for the state to communicate changes transparently. The signees include the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, Maryland Retailers Association, National Federation of Independent Business for Maryland, and representatives of the building industry, hotels and lodging, trucking, tax professionals. Bouchat hopes a balance can be struck soon that keeps people safe and business strong. “The people are hurting,” he said. "We have to find the equilibrium between the economy and public health. Where precisely that is, I don’t know.” Baltimore Sun reporters Luke Broadwater and McKenna Oxenden contributed to this article.

Here is what the $2.2 trillion economic relief package would mean to Maryland during coronavirus pandemic
.W
The U.S. Senate has passed a $2.2 trillion economic relief package to ease huge economic challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The measure now moves to the House. “You add all this up, we’re talking about a substantial amount of relief,” Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters Thursday in a conference call. “It’s hard to underscore the impact this is going to have on Maryland.” Here are some of the key provisions and what they would mean for the state: The bill establishes a $150 billion fund for state, territorial, tribal and local governments. For Maryland, that means “flexible dollars to the state and local governments to respond to all the different demands,” Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said. Maryland’s share is estimated at $2.3 billion, the senators said. The state’s largest local governments — those with at least 500,000 residents — would be permitted “to apply directly to the Department of Treasury and outline why they need these funds and how they will be used,” Van Hollen said. Those governments are Baltimore City and Baltimore County, as well as the counties of Anne Arundel, Montgomery and Prince George’s. Each is expected to receive in the range of $100 million to $150 million, according to the senators. Smaller local governments would receive their funding from the state’s allocation.  The bill includes $25 billion for public transit systems, which have seen drastically reduced ridership. Maryland’s share is about $645 million for systems such as those in Baltimore City and the Washington region, according to Van Hollen.  The legislation includes $377 billion for small businesses. The aid was pushed by Cardin for businesses in Maryland and around the country. Maryland’s small businesses employ more than a million people, according to federal estimates. The amount each receives would depend on their need and how many apply. “The unprecedented public health measures cities and states have taken to slow the spread of the COVID-19, while necessary to protect public health, are having a tremendous impact on small businesses in every community in America,” said Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Small Business Committee.  Health care providers would get $100 million. While it’s not clear how much would go to providers in the state, “Maryland hospitals will certainly benefit from that,” Van Hollen said.  The stimulus package includes “rebate” checks for individuals and couples. The payments would amount to $1,200 for people with adjusted gross incomes (in their tax returns) of as much as $75,000. Couples making up to $150,000 would receive $2,400. Additionally, taxpayers are eligible for a $500 credit per child. The payment amounts are smaller for people at higher incomes and there’s a cutoff point for people with the biggest incomes. People receiving Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance or Railroad Retirement benefits, would not need to have filed returns to receive the rebate.

Downtown Sykesville Connection using videos to highlight local businesses, stay positive amid coronavirus
.W
A Sykesville organization is using a video project to highlight local businesses, allowing owners to share a bit about their lives and what they’re doing to keep afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the spread in Maryland of the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Gov. Larry Hogan has ordered residents to stay at home and nonessential businesses to close their doors, leaving many business owners in a difficult position. So the Downtown Sykesville Connection started a video project to help downtown Sykesville business owners share stories about themselves and their businesses. According to the Julie Della-Marie, Downtown Sykesville Connection executive director, they have collected about a dozen videos from local business owners so far. “We just decided to enter the virtual world a little more seriously, but doing it still in a way that would have a Main Street meaning,” Della-Marie said. “Really, the Main Street meaning is transforming the people’s shopping visit into an experience and what’s best to do that than introducing people as they are.” The organization saw video as the best way to engage locals while still respecting guidelines for social distancing to limit the spread of the virus, Della-Marie said. Some people included their children and pets into their videos to show more of their personal life along with their business side. The videos are being posted on the organization’s Facebook page, at www.facebook.com/sykesville. Dancing at home In addition to supporting local businesses, Downtown Sykesville Connection is also working to add some positivity for community residents in a digital space. “We’re working on a large virtual dance-off,” Della-Marie said. “That’s going to take place every week. It will be different categories, everyone has to dance to the same music, the same 59 seconds of the same song.” The virtual dance-offs will have voting at the end of each week, and the grand finale will be a large virtual party where the winner of every week will battle for the grand prize, which has yet to be determined. Participants will have to prerecord their dances and send it to Downtown Sykesville Connection through social media or email downtownsykesville.events@gmail.com. According to Della-Marie, the dance-off will be launching within the next two weeks. She said details are still being worked out for how the virtual party will be held. “We realize that they’re really missing that togetherness and that it’s extremely hard for people to live in isolation right now,” she said. “So, we were trying to find a way that would serve that in a doable way by everyone because everyone has a smartphone. So it’s not hard to play that music and record a video of yourself dancing with a smartphone.” Downtown Sykesville Connection is also holding a “Draw Your Main Street” contest for Carroll County children up to 11 years old and a “What Does Main Street Mean to You?” essay contest for those ages 12 to 18. For the drawing contest, kids have to draw a picture of what their Main Street looks like and for the essay contest, teens have to share what their Main Street means to them in 250 to 500 words. The winner for each category will be invited to receive a prize at the intermission of the musical performance of the 2020 Art and Wine Festival, which is scheduled for Sept. 12.

FDA approves use of South Korean coronavirus tests purchased by Maryland’s government
.W
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a South Korean company’s coronavirus tests for use in the United States, clearing one key hurdle for Maryland officials to begin ramping up deployment of the 500,000 tests they acquired. “I am authorizing the emergency use of your product,” wrote Rear Adm. Denise M. Hinton, chief scientist of the Food and Drug Administration, in a Wednesday letter to Myoung Shin Kim, research and development manager of South Korean firm LabGenomics Co. “It is reasonable to believe ... the known and potential benefits of your product when used for diagnosing COVID-19, outweigh the known and potential risks of your product.” Ten days ago, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan announced the purchase of test kits from LabGenomics that he touted as "an exponential, game-changing step forward on our large-scale testing initiative.” The nearly $9.5 million purchase was lauded on national TV, with Hogan making numerous appearances on programs ranging from ABC’s “The View” to “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central. Since then, some local governments, nursing homes, unions and others in Maryland have clamored for the tests, but say they’ve come up empty-handed so far. “We’ve been asking, ‘Where are the tests? Where are the tests?'” said Patrick Moran, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland Council 3 union, which represents correctional officials, hospital workers and other state employees. “The governor took a victory lap before finishing the job. It is disheartening the governor sees no rush and no urgency to test the facilities where his own employees work.” After announcing the purchase of the tests April 20, Hogan was asked at a State House news conference whether the tests were ready to be deployed. The governor cautioned then that it would take some time to match the tests with necessary supplies, such as swabs, reagent and lab capacity. “They don’t have everything that’s needed," Hogan said. “You need the lab capability. You need the swabs. You need the reagents, and they all have to kind of work together. ... It’s going to take a while to ramp up all of the things that we need to utilize all of the tests.” Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said the state received preliminary FDA approval last week to use the tests from South Korea, but he was glad to see the formal approval that the FDA sent this week to the test manufacturer. “While Maryland already received FDA approval to begin using these tests last week, and have begun deploying these tests for our high-priority clusters and outbreaks, this is certainly good news," Ricci said Thursday. To date, Ricci said, he didn’t know how many of the Korean tests have been used, but he said they were being deployed to “high-priority hot spots such as nursing homes, drive-thru sites, and the new testing site in Salisbury for poultry processing plant workers.” Hogan ordered on Wednesday universal coronavirus testing at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities after hundreds of deaths at those sites and calls on state government to better protect its most vulnerable residents. Meanwhile, an outbreak among poultry workers on the Eastern Shore has made Salisbury the state’s newest hot spot. Ricci said the state still was increasing its supply of other materials needed to use more of the tests. For instance, Maryland received 34,000 swabs from the strategic national stockpile of emergency supplies and the state lab has roughly 6,000 swabs. He added that each of the state’s private lab partners has about 20,000 swabs to conduct tests. As for reagent, Ricci said, “we have adequate supply to run tests for several weeks and anticipate more reagent becoming available.” State Del. Eric Luedtke, a Montgomery County Democrat who is the House of Delegates majority leader, called FDA approval of the Korean tests “a win for Marylanders, so desperately in need of COVID testing.” “I’m hopeful that we now have all of the components necessary to fully deploy these kits to hospitals, nursing homes, state agencies, and all Marylanders can make full use of these kits,” Luedtke said. “If not, I would ask the governor to provide a full accounting and schedule of when these critically important resources will be actually usable.” In a livestreamed interview Thursday with The Washington Post, Hogan said the 500,000 tests are part of a long-term strategy for testing in the state, and they were never intended to be used “in the first week we acquired them." "Right now, we’re using all we can possibly use,” said Hogan, adding that he hopes the state can keep up with test demand. When Maryland officials arranged for the shipment from South Korea, they took steps to avoid the possibility of the federal government seizing or delaying the shipment, the Hogan administration has said. Maryland officials arranged for the Korean Air plane to land at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport in Linthicum ― which the airline doesn’t usually serve ― instead of Washington Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia. "We landed there with a large contingent of Maryland National Guard and Maryland State Police because it was an enormously valuable payload,” Hogan said in the Post interview. “It was like Fort Knox to us.” Once the tests landed, Hogan said they were taken to an undisclosed location, protected by Guard members and state troopers. Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said that he’s appreciative of the “innovative approach” Hogan used to buy the tests. Ball, a Democrat, said he understands the state has priorities and needs swabs and reagents to fully deploy the tests. “Howard County continues to coordinate with state officials to finalize acquisitions of the tests,” Ball said in a statement. “Once we receive this increased supply, we are ready to immediately expand our operations locally.” Lester Davis, a spokesman for Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, a Democrat, called the purchase of tests from South Korea an “A+ move.” “It was coup for the state to get half a million of these tests. Of course, you have to make sure you have clearance to use them and you get the swabs and other supplies,” Davis said. “As soon as they’re able to be disbursed, Baltimore City is ready to take as many tests off the state’s hands as humanly possible.” Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr., a Democrat, is waiting to hear about a time frame for when some of the tests might come to his county, according to his spokesman Sean Naron. “The test kits from South Korea are just a piece of the puzzle and we still need the appropriate swabs, reagents and lab capacity,” Naron said in a statement Thursday. “We are still waiting on a clear timeline from the state on when all these pieces will come together.”

Maryland sees deadliest day yet from coronavirus as state ramps up efforts to purchase supplies
.W
With more than two dozen deaths announced Monday, Maryland recorded its most lethal day yet from the coronavirus pandemic, and the number of confirmed cases across the state surged past 4,000. Carroll County officials reported four more deaths Monday evening from the outbreak at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, pushing the death toll at that facility alone to 14. That news came after Maryland officials announced Monday morning that 24 people had died in the state since the day before. “It’s an extremely sad day for all of us,” state Sen. Justin Ready, a Republican who is chairman of Carroll County’s Senate delegation. “It’s one of the biggest nursing home outbreaks the country. We’re still trying to figure out what happened. It illustrates how deadly this disease can be.” On a national radio interview Monday, Gov. Larry Hogan urged Marylanders to continue to comply with his stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the virus, even as many have lost their jobs due to his directives that closed nonessential businesses in the state. “There’s no question people are going through a lot of pain and suffering,” Hogan told Fox News Radio. “We’re asking people to sacrifice quite a bit. It’s a sacrifice to save their fellow human beings. Hopefully, we’ll beat this virus and help get those people back on their feet.” Hogan, a Republican, said it’s becoming clear that the greater Washington, D.C., area is likely to be the next “hotspot” for confirmed cases and deaths from the coronavirus. The region has had more than 8,000 cases, quadrupling its total in the past week, he said. In further actions to try to crack down on the virus’ spread, Hogan issued an executive order that authorizes local health departments to shut down businesses and organizations that local officials deem “unsafe facilities.” The order, signed Sunday, gives explicit authority to health officials to shut down such businesses if they are not complying with the governor’s previous orders to protect the “public health, welfare, and safety" and prevent the transmission of the novel coronavirus. Noting they’ve received few supplies coming from a federal stockpile, Maryland officials also said they’ve been rushing to purchase masks, protective equipment, ventilators and other supplies off the private market. Ellington Churchill, secretary of Maryland’s Department of General Services, said in an interview the state has spent more than $200 million on emergency equipment purchases since Hogan declared a state of emergency March 5. He said state officials have signed more than 200 contracts. “Just about everything is coming out of the private market,” Churchill said. He said Maryland is grateful for any supplies it can get from the federal government. “But we know that if it’s going to happen, we’re going to have to do it ourselves. We have to make strategic purchases of critical materials,” he said. Speaking on CNN’s “Out Front with Erin Burnett” on Monday night, Hogan said he was pleased that federal officials had recognized earlier in the day that the Washington region will be a “hotspot” for the virus. Burnett, the host, played a clip of Republican President Donald Trump claiming that the nation’s governors are “very happy, every one of them.” She asked Hogan if that statement was accurate. “To say that we’re completely happy would be an overexaggeration … Everybody’s got issues,” said Hogan, nothing that the president wasn’t on the latest conference call with U.S. governors had on the virus. The increasing death toll in Maryland comes as local and state lawmakers pushed for public tracking and disclosure of how the virus was spreading among the state’s racial groups. Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott, a Democrat, introduced a bill Monday night requiring the city health commissioner report patients’ races and ZIP codes during a health emergency. Scott joined dozens of Democratic members of the Maryland House of Delegates in pushing for the information. Eighty state lawmakers have signed a letter urging the state health department to release data on coronavirus cases broken down by race. For more than a week, Baltimore Democrat Del. Nick Mosby has been leading that charge. He says early access to racial data could help the spot disparities early in the crisis. “This significant data gap compromises the ability to effectively communicate the true risk this virus poses to our constituents and eliminates the ability to effectively engage and direct lifesaving resources,” Mosby wrote in an earlier letter to Hogan. A spokesman for Hogan, Mike Ricci, has said the state is seeking information about the races of patients from testing sites. Other states have already published preliminary data on the races of coronavirus patients, which showed black people were disproportionately affected. Both District of Columbia and city of Chicago officials released a breakdown by race Monday. In Chicago, about 70% of people who have died from COVID-19 are black. Roughly 30% of Chicago residents are black. Prince George’s County, also more than 60% black, has so far seen the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths in Maryland. As state officials rush to obtain more supplies, several entities said they were pushing for more widespread use of masks. Both the University of Maryland Medical System and LifeBridge Health now require all staff, patients and visitors to their hospitals to wear a mask at all times, the health networks announced Monday. And, following advice from the U.S. Department of Defense amid a nationwide shortage of protective face masks, the Maryland National Guard advised its members to begin making their own cloth masks. “While not an ideal solution, the CDC has indicated that even homemade masks have some protective value," confirmed Lt. Col. Wayde Minami, a guard spokesman, in a statement to The Baltimore Sun. Maryland state and health officials continue to brace for what is believed will be a bad two weeks. Some computer models that show how the pandemic may unfold, including one from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, saying a peak in hospital use in Maryland could come in late April. That would be just after a projected national peak in mid-April. Baltimore Sun reporters Kevin Rector, Lillian Reed and Talia Richman contributed to this article.

Johns Hopkins to study coronavirus treatment using plasma of recovered patients with funding from Bloomberg, Maryland
.W
Johns Hopkins is conducting promising research into a possible treatment method that aims to fight the new coronavirus using the blood of patients who have recovered from it, with $4 million in funding gifted by the state of Maryland and Bloomberg Philanthropies. The research, led by Arturo Casadevall, an infectious disease expert and faculty member of both Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, will use the blood plasma of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to determine if it can help those suffering from — or at risk of contracting — the highly contagious upper respiratory disease. No cure, vaccine or treatment regimen currently exists for the new virus, which has sickened more than 570,000 and killed nearly 27,000 around the world. Bloomberg Philanthropies will donate $3 million to the research project, with the state of Maryland providing $1 million, according to the news release. Virus vaccines are frequently made from a weakened form of the microbe that caused the disease, which enables patients’ immune systems to attack the familiar intruder. In a Friday night email, Casadevall said he owed thanks to Bloomberg for supplying “a tremendous shot in the arm that will allow us to get going on deploying convalescent sera in the fight against coronavirus." Casadevall, in a recent medical journal article co-authored with Liise-anne Pirofski of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said though a blood-based serum might not be able to cure the disease in those infected by it, the benefits likely outweigh the risks. “As we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, we recommend that institutions consider the emergency use of convalescent sera and begin preparations as soon as possible," they wrote earlier this month in the in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. “ The article argues that serums have been helpful in fighting recent international epidemics, including the 2003 SARS1 (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, the 2009 swine flu epidemic, the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic and the 2013 West African Ebola epidemic. Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City who suspended his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president this month, said the disease requires urgent attention and called it “the greatest public health challenge of our generation” in a statement included in the Friday news release. He added he hopes the blood plasma research can not only save lives of patients but also safeguard the lives of healthcare workers on the front lines. Though Johns Hopkins will lead the research, other medical centers and doctors from nearly two dozen hospitals and research centers will participate, including researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, the Stanford University Medical Center in California, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. The plasma will be isolated after it is harvested from donors — both COVID-19 and patients who have not contracted the virus but are considered high risk or likely to be exposed — at local Red Cross blood banks or the New York Blood Bank, which is collaborating in this effort. In a statement, Hogan said the state is fortunate to be surrounded by some of the best health research facilities in the world. “I am confident in our state’s ability to be a leader in developing treatments and perhaps even a vaccine for COVID-19,” said Gov. Hogan. “I want to sincerely thank Bloomberg Philanthropies and Johns Hopkins University for working with our state to form this exciting public-private partnership, which will protect the health and well-being of our citizens and has the potential to save thousands of lives.” Baltimore Sun reporter Mary Carole McCauley contributed to this article.

University of Maryland injects coronavirus vaccine in first volunteers, aiming for approvals in fall
.W
Medical staff at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have begun injecting the first few people with a potential vaccine for the coronavirus as part of an accelerated international effort to have a vaccine ready to begin use in some people as early as this fall. The trial at the university’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health and three other sites in the United States and Germany is for four separate but similar vaccine candidates developed by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. and the German biotech company BioNTech. Pfizer announced the U.S. trials Tuesday morning. “We’re not skipping any steps, but we are speeding them up quite a bit,” said Dr. Kirsten Lyke, an infectious disease expert and the study’s lead investigator in Baltimore. “This vaccine is actually four different vaccines, with testing moving rapidly, head-to-head. ... We’re hoping one rises to the top.” Lyke, a professor of medicine and faculty member at the University of Maryland’s vaccine development center, said she and other researchers learned a lot from work on quick-moving threats such as the Ebola virus about how to expedite the vaccine trial process. There are no vaccines or even specific treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by this coronavirus. With almost 250,000 deaths globally and more than 68,000 in the United States, federal and international regulators have moved with urgency and allowed several vaccine trials to move ahead at unprecedented speed. More than one vaccine likely will be approved and needed to protect billions of people across the globe. The four vaccines tested at Maryland and the other sites, with Pfizer funding, are variations of the same type of vaccine. The mRNA, or messenger RNA, vaccine works by conveying genetic instructions to a person’s cells to make a specific protein that can induce production of antibodies that would fight the real virus if someone came in contact with it. It differs from traditional vaccines because it does not inject a virus protein into the body. An mRNA vaccine has been tested but never approved. It’s shown promise for infectious diseases and some kinds of cancer. Five people were injected Monday and 360 will be injected with one of the vaccines or a placebo in total in the first phase, which is expected to end in June. If any of the vaccines are shown to be safe and effective, they will continue in the process. The trial eventually will expand to 840 people, with results expected by fall. The first people injected are healthy people as young as age 18, followed by older people up to age 85 and then people with health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure that put them at risk for complications from COVID-19. They will each get two shots a month apart. A veteran of vaccine trials, Lyke said she’s never done one quite this way or this quickly but said it should offer hope to the public that the scientific community is working as fast as possible. Absent a vaccine, distancing requirements are unlikely to fully ease. Many of the university’s trial participants come from the campus and related medical community. Michael Sikorski, who is in the fourth year of a dual medical and doctoral degree at the university, decided to volunteer for the experimental vaccine. He gets a shot Wednesday. He said he’s familiar enough with the mRNA types of vaccines in development to know they are low risk because he’s not being injected with the actual virus. That was something he was glad to tell his family and friends, some of whom expressed reservations about his participation. Sikorski said he heard about the trial through a campus newsletter, and feeling thankful to the university generally and his mentors specifically, he wanted to help. The trial also allows him to be part of the effort to stop the spread of the deadly virus. “This is a pandemic like none of us have seen before,” he said. “If I could play any role in a vaccine, it would be meaningful to me.” Someday, he expects not only to treat patients, but also to conduct research, possibly into vaccines. As an early participant, he received a low dose or even a placebo. Even if the vaccine is effective, he may need another vaccination. He said that will be “whichever one gets to the finish line first.” It also could be one that is produced and available in Maryland. With billions of people around the world needing vaccination, experts believe more than one vaccine will need to be approved, manufactured and distributed. The manufacturing and distribution system has not been worked out yet. Ramping that up will be the next challenge, Lyke said. Limited early doses likely would go to those most at risk, such as first responders, medical personnel and nursing home residents. Other vaccines are in development in the United States, including two others at the University of Maryland. Emergent Biosolutions, a Gaithersburg-based firm with manufacturing facilities in Baltimore designed for emergency drug production, has partnered with Johnson & Johnson, the Rockville company Novavax Inc. and Vaxart Inc., a California firm working with University of Maryland doctors, on developing different potential vaccines for the coronavirus. Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, director of the university’s vaccine development center, is working on the trial with Lyke and another one as co-lead of a consortium established by the National Institutes of Health at Emory University in Atlanta to quickly tackle new infectious diseases. “We are excited to begin testing these vaccine candidates against COVID-19," she said in a statement. "The research is on a fast track given the extreme consequences of this pandemic and the critical need for preventive measures.” The National Institutes of Health announced last month that it was bringing industry and government agencies together to accelerate vaccine and treatment development and approvals. Officials said there were more than 100 potential therapeutics for COVID-19 in the works, and that the program would provide guidance and help prioritize the candidates. “Using the most advanced clinical trial methods to rapidly test multiple interventions will help get the answers we need as soon as possible to expedite potential prevention and treatment approaches to fight COVID-19,” said Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in a statement at the time. “Collaboration is a critical ingredient for success and the FDA will continue to use every tool possible under our Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program to speed the development of safe and effective medical countermeasures.” The mRNA trial will go on for 26 months, even if a vaccine is approved for use, so researchers can learn how long immunity may last. Injections of volunteers in Germany began in late April. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer, said in a statement that historically vaccine development takes years, but collaboration with regulators is speeding the process. “This pursuit requires a crucial multi-pronged approach with a deep collaboration and partnership across our healthcare innovation ecosystem — from the academic community including our initial partnership with New York University and the University of Maryland School of Medicine, industry partners, policy makers and regulatory bodies,” he said. “In the matter of weeks, we’ve accelerated what takes years into months, months into weeks and weeks into matter of days in order to rapidly enter the clinic and face this public health challenge head-on to try to help patients in dire need.” The trial in Baltimore is still enrolling. Participants are paid a fee of about $1,375. Those interested can call 410-706-6156, email clinicaltrial@som.umaryland.edu or go to the website.

Baltimore Mayor Young apologizes to deaf community after cutting off ASL interpreter during coronavirus news conference
.W
Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young apologized to the city’s deaf community Thursday, two days after he cut off a sign-language interpreter during a news conference about the coronavirus that was disrupted by protesters. Young held a news conference Tuesday in front of City Hall that was interrupted by advocates for the city’s homeless population. They called for Young to take additional steps to protect vulnerable residents in Baltimore who can’t simply “stay home” during the pandemic. The mayor’s voice was drowned out by the protesters, and he eventually paused his remarks. But the interpreter continued to sign, conveying the protesters’ message to those watching the news conference. Young then tapped the interpreter, telling him: “You interpret for us.” The man stopped signing. When the protesters eventually finished their demonstration, Young resumed his remarks and the interpreter picked up again. Some have criticized the mayor for effectively silencing a person whose job it is to ensure that people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing get an accurate sense of what’s happening. The Baltimore City Association of the Deaf sent a letter to Young saying it hopes he learns from the experience and doesn’t repeat that behavior in the future. The mayor’s actions, the letter states, are “considered as oppressive behavior toward our community.” “Citizens watching your press conference without a hearing loss are able to hear your message, as well as the protesters,” it reads. “The Deaf and Hard of Hearing citizens were excluded from that same equal access to the protesters’ messages.” Joshua Lamont, an interpreter who lives in Hampden, called the city to complain about the mayor’s actions. He said interpreters have a duty to convey what can be heard. Many people in Baltimore rely on interpreters during news conferences, especially now, as the city works to disseminate critical information about the coronavirus pandemic. “We have one job,” Lamont said. “We are hired for communication access. The only job of an interpreter is to communicate. To stand there and say, ‘Stop this because I don’t like the message,’ that is gross." Young said Thursday that his actions were not intended as a "slight to the deaf community,” adding that he has a brother who is deaf. “I stopped everything because I wanted to make sure the protesters were heard,” Young said. “I didn’t mean any harm to the deaf community.” Johns Hopkins Professor Nicholas Reed, who researches hearing loss, said the mayor’s actions point to larger issues during this pandemic related to disability inclusivity and public health. It’s an especially difficult time for those with hearing loss, Reed said, as many people are covering their mouths with masks, ramping up telecommunication and physically distancing themselves. Given the situation, he said, proper access to information during a public health crisis is vital. “They have a right to equitable access and to understand what was said, without any filters,” Reed said.

Maryland hasn’t released racial breakdown of coronavirus cases, despite pressure from black lawmakers 
.W
Maryland’s health department has not published data on the racial breakdown of coronavirus cases, despite escalating pressure from black lawmakers. Members of the Legislative Black Caucus say such information is vital to spot disparities that could arise in testing, treatment and, ultimately, outcomes. “While it is clear COVID-19 does not discriminate among its victims, racial health disparities, access to care, diagnosis and treatment have long been a concern of minority communities,” Democratic Sen. Charles Sydnor wrote Wednesday in a letter to Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. The Baltimore County legislator is one of several members of the General Assembly who are pushing the state to publish data on the race of patients infected by the new coronavirus, alongside the already public breakdowns by age, gender and county. Del. Darryl Barnes, chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, said the group expects to file a formal request by the end of the week for a racial breakdown of cases. “I understand there’s a lot going on in trying to keep everyone safe and at home,” Barnes said. “But this data is critically important.” Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci said the state is seeking information about the races of patients from testing sites. “We are working through the process of reporting out this information, and will be sure to keep the legislators updated on their request," he said in a statement. "What we can be sure of is that no one is immune, and everyone needs to take the spread of this virus seriously.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has not made data available by race, although high-profile Democratic lawmakers are pushing for that. In a letter Monday to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the national lawmakers wrote that the dearth of information “will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities." A handful of other states and counties began publishing such data over the last week. African American leaders and doctors across the country are cautioning that their communities could be especially hard hit. U.S. cities with large black and brown populations, such as Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans are hot spots of the outbreak. Data from Mecklenburg County, North Carolina — where Charlotte is located — showed that while black residents make up about a third of the population, they account for roughly 44% of confirmed COVID-19 cases. “Certainly, African Americans are disproportionately impacted, and I’d like to understand some of the ‘whys’ behind that,” Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell told The Charlotte Observer. “I’m very concerned about that — it’s alarming, and it’s something we have to get under control immediately.” In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, all eight people who had died from COVID-19, as of last week, were black. Some state health departments are publishing data, albeit incomplete, on race. As of March 27 in Illinois, the health department was reporting 39% of cases involved white residents, while 28% of COVID-19 patients were black. The state’s population is 14.6% black. In one-fifth of Illinois cases, race was unknown. In Michigan, a state where black residents make up roughly 14% of the population, black people accounted for more than one-third of all cases and 40% of deaths. The race of 30% of Michigan patients was unknown. Virginia’s health department says the race of 61% of cases is unknown. Still, where the race is known, about a quarter are black and more than half are white. Maryland Del. Nick Mosby, a Baltimore Democrat, started publicly calling over the weekend for the state to begin tracking cases by race. Other lawmakers quickly joined in. “It is pertinent we start this discussion now, in the midst of a national crisis, to ensure proper attention is placed on addressing any health inequities in real time,” Mosby wrote Thursday in a letter to Maryland Health Secretary Robert Neall. “With more complete and comprehensive data, our state and local authorities are better positioned to support communities with an elevated risk.” Baltimore’s population is more than 60% black, compared to roughly 30% of Maryland’s population. Black people in America suffer higher rates of asthma and diabetes — the kinds of underlying health conditions that could put patients at a greater risk of COVID-19 complications. Doctors also have expressed fear that health care providers’ implicit racial bias could play into their decision about who receives a coronavirus test, which are in short supply. “We don’t have clarity about how people are gaining access to a test,” Del. Stephanie Smith said. “We’re in a health care culture that, despite its noble ideals, has challenges delivering the same quality of care to all patients.” Many people of color have deep-rooted fears about the way they will be treated by hospitals. Without a full data picture, advocates warn, it becomes harder to tailor public health messaging to specific at-risk communities. Community organizers already say they have to combat a myth that black people can’t contract the virus. Smith, a Baltimore Democrat, said some people living in the city’s poorest, most violent neighborhoods have become used to a heightened level of stress and trauma, to the point that this pandemic may not register in the same way it does within communities used to more stability. Race-specific data would “give us another communication lever,” Smith said. “The more specific and more personal you can make your targeting, the more effective you are."

To prepare for possible spread of coronavirus, Howard County officials will participate in simulated exercise
.W
Howard County government officials held a news conference Tuesday to discuss the county’s plan to address the new coronavirus. While County Executive Calvin Ball said there were no confirmed cases in the county or state, county officials on Friday will participate in a tabletop exercise — an activity for key personnel to simulate an emergency situation — for how to handle the virus if it should hit Howard County. “I’d like to reassure all of our Howard County residents and visitors that we are prepared to respond,” Ball said. Maura Rossman, Howard’s County’s health officer, said none of the 11 cases pending testing at the state level are Howard County residents. “In Howard County we are still in the containment phase of the coronavirus,” Rossman said. “The immediate risk remains low.” As of Wednesday, there were more than 100 cases across the United States scattered across at least 15 states, with 27 cases in Washington state alone. There have been nine deaths, all in that state. Rossman suggested Howard County residents begin to make plans in case the virus continues to spread; plans should consider how residents would self-contain and how they could continue to care for family, neighbors and friends. “This is not a time to panic. This is a situation that we feel we have under control and we are managing,” said Mohammed Shafeeq Ahmed, chief medical officer of Howard County General Hospital. “Although it is rapidly evolving, I want you to be reassured that the hospital is making plans and has plans in place for an event where we are taking care of patients with coronavirus.” Acting Fire Chief Bill Anuszewski was among county officials at the conference and announced there will be additional screening questions that 911 operators will ask callers with influenza-type symptoms. Operators will now ask Howard County residents if they’ve traveled to affected areas, if they’ve been exposed to someone who has a known case and if they’re running a fever. The county also said residents can call a hotline at 410-313-6284 to respond to any coronavirus questions. The Howard County Public School System sent out a districtwide email Tuesday afternoon to say how it is preparing for coronavirus. Schools Superintendent Michael Martirano wrote he is being “asked more and more” about how the school system is preparing for the possibility of confirmed coronavirus cases in Howard County and the state. The school system is in phase one of its comprehensive emergency operations plan that was developed with the Howard County Health Department and the Office of Emergency Management. Phase one is “where the county is deemed to be a relatively low risk of a pandemic disease,” according to the email. In phase one, the school system provides information, monitors the health of students and staff, and assesses field trips on a daily basis and community use of school facilities. “The primary factor that influences this decision is the location of the field trip and whether that area has a locally declared health emergency,” the email states. On the school system’s website, there is a page dedicated to information and updates about the coronavirus. School nurses and health staff are focused on helping students take preventive measures, including hand-washing, using hand sanitizer and identifying students who may be sick with a virus. The school system is purchasing hand sanitizer refills to keep all schools stocked. The email mentions potential school closings that could be “deemed necessary to protect the safety of our students and staff.” Martirano wrote there have been instances where Howard schools have closed for several days and the school system worked with county and state partners to ensure state education department requirements were met during that time. Earlier this week, the Howard County Health Department announced a series of free community presentations to provide more information on coronavirus. According to the health department, the presentations will inform Howard residents about current developments, local planning efforts and preventive actions. The presentations are scheduled for: 7 to 8:30 p.m. Wednesday at East Columbia Branch library, 6600 Cradlerock Way;  2 to 3 p.m. Thursday at Elkridge Branch library, 6540 Washington Blvd.;  2 to 3 p.m. Tuesday at Miller Branch library, 9421 Frederick Road in Ellicott City. The first library presentation on Wednesday will be livestreamed via Facebook and posted on YouTube afterward. Space will be limited for people who want to attend in person, so residents are encouraged to view the livestream or YouTube video. Those interested in attending a presentation in person must register ahead of time. To register, go to hclibrary.org/classes-events and then search “Protecting You and Your Families” to find the specific presentation.

Resident at Columbia retirement community is confirmed of dying from the coronavirus 
.W
The day after the Howard County Health Department announced the county’s first deaths from the coronavirus, a retirement community in Columbia said one of the victims was a resident. Two Howard County men, ages 75 and 90, have died from the coronavirus, the county health department announced Sunday. Vantage House did not say whether its resident was the 75-year-old or 90-year-old victim. The resident died in a hospital, not at Vantage House, according to a statement from Meriann Ritacco, executive director at the retirement community. A request for comment was not immediately returned Monday night. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends during this most difficult time,” Ritacco said in a statement. “The health and safety of our residents and employees is our top priority; therefore, at the onset of this health crisis, we enhanced our internal processes and protocols to better protect our community,” Ritacco added. There are 17 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Maryland as of Monday night.

With coronavirus at more than 80 nursing homes in Maryland, Gov. Hogan increases protective measures
.W
With confirmed cases of the new coronavirus found in over 80 nursing homes across the state, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued an emergency order Sunday aimed at curbing the spread of the illness in such facilities, many of which have been ravaged by similar outbreaks across the country. Per the order, “symptomatic” residents now qualify for expedited COVID-19 tests, administered either by the state or other public laboratories. The state is giving priority in testing to such residents, as well as health care workers, patients in hospitals and first responders believed to have the disease. Among the other measures included in the order, nursing home staff who interact with residents will be required to wear personal protective equipment, and homes must create separate areas with designated staff to care for positive and suspected cases of the disease. “As we have been saying for several weeks, older Marylanders and those with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable and at a significantly higher risk of contracting, getting more severely ill, and dying from this disease,” Hogan wrote in a news release. “Of major concern is that we currently have cases or clusters of cases at 81 nursing homes and long-term care facilities across the state. Our highest priority is keeping Marylanders safe, and we will use every tool at our disposal to protect the most vulnerable among us.” The death toll from the disease in Maryland reached 67, the state announced Sunday. Confirmed cases of coronavirus increased to at least 3,609. Almost 25,000 people have tested negative for COVID-19 in the state and 936 have been hospitalized. The 14 deaths added Sunday to the state’s total included a Baltimore woman in her 30s; two Baltimore County men, one in his 50s and the other in his 70s, and two Carroll County women, one in her 60s and the other over 80. A national shortage of testing kits has created gaps of knowledge required to understand the virus’ nature, severity and extent of exposure, medical experts and researchers say. With tests in limited supply, potential carriers of the coronavirus without symptoms often do not qualify for swabs. That creates the possibility of intermixing vulnerable people — such as nursing home residents — with staff members who may have been exposed to the virus without knowing it. The order for nursing homes to expedite testing through the Maryland State Public Health Laboratory comes after The Baltimore Sun reported a Carroll County nursing home that’s an epicenter of the disease had not been able to test staff amid the national shortage of tests. Hogan has said a staff member who did not have symptoms likely brought the virus to the Pleasant View Nursing & Rehabilitation in Mount Airy, where 10 people have died and dozens are sick. County health department officials announced the 10th COVID-19-related fatality of a Pleasant View resident Sunday, shortly after the governor issued the order. They also announced that three additional Pleasant View staff members have tested positive, bringing the total to 27. On Friday, Frances Phillips, deputy director for public health services for the state health department, said there was now “clear evidence” that asymptomatic staff have been inadvertently helping the spread of coronavirus in nursing homes. At that point, she said the state lab was reserving testing capacity for nursing home staff and residents and instructed nursing homes to use the state lab so they would get the fastest results. Hogan’s order Sunday made it mandatory for nursing homes to use the state lab. “This includes using either a test kit provided by the Maryland State Lab or sending their test specimens if using the nursing home’s own test kit to the Maryland State Lab for COVID-19 testing of residents and staff,” the health department told nursing homes Sunday. Also in the order, nursing home staff who interact with residents will be required to use face masks, appropriate eye protection, gloves and a gown. According to Mike Ricci, the governor’s communications director, a process is in place for nursing homes to obtain personal protective equipment from state and local health departments. Facilities must now also designate personnel to care for known and suspected residents with COVID-19 in a separate room that serves as an observation area. Newly admitted and readmitted residents will stay in this area for 14 days and be monitored for symptoms of the virus. An additional observation area will be designated to care for residents who have been designated to have or suspected to have COVID-19. Under the new order, the state health department can assist acute care hospitals in discharging and finding placements for patients who require nursing-home level care. Nursing home residents admitted or seen at a hospital for COVID-19 must be allowed to go back to the nursing homes from which they came, so long as the facilities adhere to federal recommendations for transmission-based precautions. Residents can be sent to short-term placements, if necessary. “Every effort” must be made to transfer former residents back to their original nursing homes as soon as possible, according to the order. Mary-Claire Roghmann, professor of epidemiology and public health and medicine, associate dean for physician scientist training at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and associate hospital epidemiologist and physician at the VA Maryland Health Care System, said though she was not intimately familiar with the governor’s latest order, each of the mandates could significantly slow the spread of the virus in these facilities. But, she said, shortages in critical supplies such as personal protective gear and testing kits could render the governor’s orders less effective than desired. “Nursing homes are going to be absolutely critical to helping us recover from this epidemic,” she said. “My hope is, in the future, we’ll be able to test all our staff to see if they’ll be able to determine if they’ve been be exposed, so they’ll have less anxiety about caring for people.” Roghmann also said not every nursing home in the state has the space to assign a designed observation unit, but staffs should consider moving residents to different rooms and floors when necessary. Establishing distinct cohorts within facilities for COVID-19 patients and for those who test negative for the disease will be essential, she added. “You typically don’t move patients without a very good reason, and this is a very good reason,” she said. “We’re going to have to think about how we separate nursing homes to make it possible to care for each group.” Some nursing home spokespersons and staff said Sunday that they had previously instituted some of the protocols mandated by the governor’s order — such as the use of masks and gloves by workers. Dan Dunne, spokesman for Erickson Living, said his company had “followed and stayed ahead of guidelines issued by the CDC and local health departments,” but appreciated the measures outlined in Hogan’s order. Statewide, more than 3,600 residents have tested positive for the disease and nearly 70 have died. Worldwide, over 1.2 million people are known to have the disease, with the U.S. suffering the largest recorded outbreak so far.

With coronavirus spreading, Maryland Gov. Hogan signs order for expedited release of hundreds of prisoners
.W
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread behind bars in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan has signed an executive order to expedite the release of hundreds of men and women imprisoned at state correctional institutions. Hogan’s order, posted Sunday morning, speeds up the release of inmates who were already eligible to be released within the next four months and the processing of inmates eligible for home detention. The order also directs the Maryland Parole Commission to accelerate consideration of parole for inmates convicted of nonviolent crimes who are older than 60, have a good record while incarcerated, and have an approved plan for re-entry to society. “It is in the public interest to prevent inmates’ exposure to the novel coronavirus by expeditiously moving them to alternative places of confinement, such as in supervised community placement or their homes,” Hogan’s order states. The order does not apply to inmates convicted of sexual offenses or those displaying symptoms of COVID-19. Mike Ricci, spokesman for the Republican governor, said the administration estimates the executive order will result in the early release of about 700 inmates who would be leaving prisons in the next four months and about 100 who could receive expedited parole. Robert L. Green, Maryland’s secretary of public safety and correctional services, said he would begin implementing Hogan’s order immediately. “We are going to move without hesitation to fulfill the order of the governor,” Green said. The decision was praised by Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who was the first prosecutor to call on Hogan to make such releases. “This is a victory for public health, public safety and common sense,” Mosby said. “We are pleased to see him incorporate many of the recommendations we made in a proposal sent around a month ago.” For weeks, some prosecutors, public defenders and criminal justice advocates have called for the release of nonviolent offenders during the pandemic. Last week, Maryland’s chief judge, Mary Ellen Barbera, encouraged the release of nonviolent youths and adults, instructing the trial courts to consider coronavirus a factor in decisions. The Democrats in Maryland’s Congressional delegation sent a letter to Hogan Thursday, urging him and the Parole Commission to identify and release state prisoners who pose no danger to the public. Attorney General Brian Frosh also has advocated for the release of such inmates. Advocates and family members of inmates say they are concerned about the close quarters of life behind bars, making it easy for the virus to spread. Paul DeWolfe, the Maryland public defender, called the order “a good first step” in reducing health risks in the prison population. But he urged the state to consider further steps, including considering release of some of the state’s oldest inmates and those with medical conditions who “pose a very low safety risk in the community but face exceptionally high health risks in prison.” Coronavirus outbreaks have run rampant in some states, including the Rikers Island jail in New York and the Cook County Jail in Chicago. Maryland prison officials say the number of coronavirus infections in their facilities has increased to 136 people who either are serving time or work in 10 prisons. They counted the largest number, 40 cases, at the Jessup Correctional Institution. One prisoner, a man in his 60s, has died of the virus. Hogan had previously expressed a reluctance to release state prisoners, saying last month, “they’re safer where they are." But at a news conference in Annapolis Friday, Hogan said he was “obviously concerned about potential outbreaks” in the prisons. Prior to Hogan’s order, Green said he was already working to reduce the prison population. Since March,the population of people incarcerated at state-run prisons and jails has declined by 650. About 18,400 people are now in state correctional custody. Green said he’s taken a number of steps to keep both staff and inmates healthy. He said he suspended visitors to the prisons, while providing inmates with free phone calls; ordered temperature checks of staff at every shift change; required staff to wear protective gear; and distributed face masks to inmates. Any inmate with symptoms of COVID-19 is taken to the infirmary area of the correctional facility or an off-site care facility, Green added. Meanwhile, area prosecutors also are taking action to reduce the populations of their local jails. In Baltimore, Mosby has recommended the courts release 114 people awaiting trial. Her office found another 40 people should be released early because they were within 90 days of finishing their sentence. In Baltimore County, 50 to 75 people have been released. In Anne Arundel, at least 40 people awaiting trial were released. Carroll County released about 45 people, and Howard County released four people. Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger said Hogan’s order is similar to the actions local prosecutors are taking. “Nobody is in the Division of Corrections for shoplifting,” Shellenberger said. “But there are some nonviolent criminals and those who don’t pose a threat to public safety. What the governor has done and the categories he’s laid out is very similar to what the state’s attorneys have been doing with their local detention centers. We believe this is the right thing to do.” Baltimore Sun reporters Tim Prudente and Scott Dance contributed to this article.

Veterans fair canceled, Carroll Lutheran Village kickoff celebration postponed over coronavirus concerns
.W
Two of the larger events scheduled in Carroll County over the next week will not go on as scheduled because of fears of the spread of the coronavirus. The Veterans Claims Clinic & Resource Fair, which had been scheduled for March 19 at Carroll Community College, has been canceled and the 40th anniversary celebration kick-off event at Carroll Lutheran Village, which had been set for March 16, has been postponed. There are no cases of the coronavirus at Carroll Lutheran Village, but the senior living community “is taking every precaution necessary to help prevent the virus” from spreading in this area, according to a CLV news release. The 40th anniversary committee will announce a new date once one is confirmed, the release said. The veterans clinic was billed as an event to give veterans multiple opportunities at one site to file or follow up on a VA compensation and pension claim, apply for VA health care, learn about programs and services, find community resources and obtain a veteran ID. “At all times, the health and safety of Maryland’s veterans is our top priority," a county government news release said. “We apologize for any inconvenience this cancellation may cause and look forward to rescheduling the event in the future. In the meantime, we encourage everyone to protect themselves and others by following guidance regarding COVID-19 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.” That guidance is available at www.cdc.gov.

University of Maryland School of Medicine creates website on kids’ wellness during coronavirus 
.W
The University of Maryland School of Medicine has launched a website to help provide the latest information to parents, as well as pediatric medical providers, on keeping children safe and healthy during the coronavirus pandemic. The virus has infected hundreds in Maryland and tens of thousands across the country so far. Maryland health officials reported that as of March 27, there are four children ages 0-9 with the related coronavirus disease, COVID-19 — including a Howard County 5-year-old. Another 11 people ages 10-19 have it. The university website aims to provide both professional guidance for practices and practical tips for parents navigating the outbreak. It includes information on preventing infections but also on maintaining general health. “It’s very important that our health systems are prepared,” said Dr. James Campbell, professor of pediatrics and an infectious disease specialist at Maryland, who spearheaded the Kids & COVID-19 resource page. “We want to make sure children are still vaccinated and have access to routine pediatric care that is essential to keeping children healthy.” The site provides guidance and protocols from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention on COVID-19 and on general topics such as care for other illnesses. The site also includes links to other resources, including some educational sites, as schools and day care centers have been ordered closed.

Carroll County courts close due to coronavirus, state’s chief judge orders
.W
Carroll County courts have closed to the public due to the coronavirus, court officials have said. Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of Maryland Mary Ellen Barbera has ordered all courts in the Maryland Judiciary, court offices, administrative offices, units of the Judiciary, and the Offices of the Clerks of the Circuit Courts closed to the public through May 1. Judiciary operations will continue to the extent practicable, the release reads. Except for certain matters, such as domestic violence, extreme risk protective orders, peace orders and emergency evaluation petitions, all matters scheduled to be heard between March 17 and May 1 are postponed pending further order of the chief judge of the Court of Appeals. Heather DeWees, clerk of the Circuit Court of Carroll County, said she supports the chief judge’s decision. “I think it is important that we balance the safety of our citizens and staffs with the services the courts provide to to the public. I appreciate that Chief Judge Barbera closed the courts to the public to combat the spread of coronavirus in our state and communities," DeWees said. The Clerk’s Office just implemented a new process that allows employees to email some of the judges’ orders to the public instead of mailing them, according to DeWees, which will enable some employees to work from home. “Like most administrators, I’m praying for the health of my employees and their families,” DeWees said. "I’m hoping that everyone does their due diligence in order for this pandemic to come to a quick end so that we all can conduct business as usual.” If someone is unsure whether their case will be heard, call the Clerk of the Circuit Court’s Office at 410-386-8710, call District Court at 410-871-3500 or visit the Maryland Judiciary’s website at mdcourts.gov, the District Court’s website at courts.state.md.us, or the Carroll County Circuit Court’s website at CarrollCountyCircuitCourt.org. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. The hotline is also open the weekend of March 14. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Judge for now won’t release 2 immigrants held in Maryland jails with high coronavirus risks 
.W
A federal judge declined to order the release of two people from immigration detention facilities in Maryland after their lawyers argued that they are at a high risk of death or serious illness from a coronavirus infection. But U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang said he would quickly consider a similar release motion from the two men if COVID-19 is reported within their detention centers or if the centers do not adequately test people with suspected symptoms of the virus. Chuang's ruling late Friday came in a lawsuit filed by immigrants' rights advocates. It follows other recent court orders to free people from immigration detention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The two men who sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Maryland case have been held in civil detention at the Worcester County Detention Center and the Howard County Detention Center while waiting for their immigration cases to be resolved. One of the plaintiffs, a 52-year-old citizen of El Salvador, has diabetes. The other, a 54-year-old citizen of Guatemala, has hypertension and prostate problems. They were among more than 35,000 people who were in ICE custody as of last weekend. Practicing "social distancing" and better hygiene is impossible in crowded detention centers, plaintiffs' lawyers argued. "Even with the measures ICE has purported to take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities, immigration detention centers are a hotbed for spread of the virus," the March 24 lawsuit said. Neither Maryland detention center has a single confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, Justice Department attorney Vincent Vaccarella said during a Thursday court hearing. A "purely speculative risk" of contracting COVID-19 doesn't entitle the plaintiffs to immediate release, Vaccarella said in a court filing. In denying the plaintiffs' temporary restraining order, Chaung wrote that he didn't find the threat of the new coronavirus in society as opposed to inside a detention center "inflicts unconstitutional punishment on high-risk detainees." "To adopt petitioners' position would be to hold that the detention of any high-risk immigration detainee during the pandemic is necessarily unconstitutional, a position that the court is not presently prepared to adopt," he wrote. But should COVID-19 cases turn up in the detention center or tests aren't made available, Chaung wrote that the plaintiffs likely would be successful in their case "based on deliberate indifference" to their serious medical needs. The Maryland plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the ACLU of Maryland. Similar lawsuits have been filed in other states, including California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington state, according to the ACLU. Earlier this week, federal judges in California and Pennsylvania ordered ICE to release several detainees who sued.

‘It’s important to feel valued and heard’: Maryland nurses create Facebook group to unite during coronavirus
.W
When Stacey Warther clicked the blue “create” box on her computer screen, she had no idea the world she was inviting thousands of nurses across Maryland to join. Warther, a part-time corporate wellness nurse, had no idea how desperate nurses would be for someone who understood the new realities of what it meant to be fighting the seemingly never-ending battle of the coronavirus. High anxiety from the difficult balance of personal and professional life, frustration with lack of authorized personal protective equipment, even yearning for shoe recommendations to release the pressure of increasingly long hours standing up, flood the Maryland Nurses Unite ASAP Facebook group every day. “It’s become a sounding board for people who are scared,” Warther, 59, said. When Maryland Nurses Unite ASAP group was created March 17, there were only 20 members, mostly nurse friends of Warther. Within one day, the group grew to 1,000 members; as of Monday, there are more than 13,000 members. “What became more apparent is that [the coronavirus pandemic] was evolving and the nurses on the front lines needed support,” said co-founder Colleen Cunningham of Clarksville. “[Warther] and I knew that nurses needed a place where they could go and be heard and feel valued.” However, this wasn’t what Eldersburg resident Warther and Cunningham, 55, originally had in mind. Cunningham, a Johns Hopkins Home Care Group nurse, and Warther wanted to create a space for Howard and Carroll County residents to ask nurses questions about the coronavirus. “Here we are in the middle of a pandemic. I thought I was going to be helping people with food and other resources, but here I am helping with medical resources,” Warther said. “We thought [the Facebook group] would be nurses who had more time on their hands, [but] the page kind of morphed into a complete platform of what’s going on on the front lines.” As it became clear the group would be a space for nurses to honestly reflect about the current realities, ask difficult ethical questions and discuss best practices among themselves, Cunningham and Warther created a second group for residents to share resources and volunteer opportunities and ask questions surrounding the pandemic: Maryland Communities Unite ASAP. “It’s really important to verbalize fear and anxiety right now,” Cunningham said. “Social media has created this incredible and valuable tool where we can come together and talk about things in real time. This will be a valuable site for a very long time.” Ami Ayers, 41, works as an assistant nurse manager in the emergency room at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore and was one of the original members of the group. “I have been watching and learning from the group,” Ayers said. “I like the idea that this is people in my [geographic] area, my network, my local hospitals.” Ayers, an Ellicott City resident, said the group has brought her new ideas that she can use in her facility. She’s also seen nurses post about ideas that didn’t work in their facilities, and she said now she’s less likely to try them. “It’s multipurpose for me. [It’s helping me] personally and professionally both,” Ayers said. “[Maryland Nurses Unite ASAP] allows that safe area for nurses to vent.” Cunningham said she never could have imagined the demand for a resource like this. “This is obviously something nurses have needed for a long time,” she said, tearing up. “It’s important to feel valued and heard. You don’t necessarily get [that] through your employer.” Warther and Cunningham, who both worked on the front lines during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, frequently use war metaphors to describe working during the pandemic and emphasize in the Facebook group the need to be goal-oriented. “What are we looking to accomplish? We were going to help hold up the back line while the front line has to go into battle,” Warther said. By providing the space to strategize and prepare for their next shift, Warther said nurses across the state are helping to hold up the back lines. “We knew there were going to be gaps and barriers, but we had no idea to the extent of what [the coronavirus] was going to do to our health care system,” she said. The women also said the group is providing a space for necessary ethical discussions surrounding the current health care system. Warther said the group is not a place for politics or fear-mongering; instead, it’s an open forum for nurses to discuss what works and what doesn’t. “They’re really exposing some of their feelings to strangers as if they know each other. Talking about anxiety and PTSD, [asking], ‘Does anyone feel this way? I feel like I’m losing it.’ They’re talking each other off the ledge,” Warther said. "They give each other really good advice. Their vulnerability is what is building their courage at the same time.”

School nurses in Harford County donate protective gear to support hospital workers during coronavirus crisis
.W
Angela Gottesfeld, the school nurse at Hickory Elementary School, pulled up with a trunk filled with medical protective gear, part of an initiative by Harford County Public Schools to encourage school nurses to donate their supplies and support health care workers in area hospitals as they treat patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. “I want to support them as much as I can, my fellow co-workers, nurses and doctors and respiratory therapists,” Gottesfeld said. A school bus was stationed Thursday in the parking lot of the Black Eyed Suzie’s restaurant in downtown Bel Air, near the HCPS headquarters building, to receive donations. Three school system staffers greeted each nurse as they drove into the lot. School bus driving instructors Denise Ajello and Tina Hockaday wore blue gloves, and float nurse Linda Jensen took the extra step of wearing a plastic gown over her clothing to protect herself as she carried boxes of supplies. Donors were encouraged to put their supplies, which were in small boxes, bags or plastic canisters, into larger containers “so we weren’t having to handle so many loose items,” Jensen said. “We’ve had a great turnout today,” she said. “The nurses have done a fantastic job bringing their supplies.” The receivers took the supplies out while the donor remained in their vehicle, and then brought them to the bus. More than half of the bus was filled with boxes of supplies, such as gloves, face masks, gowns, hand sanitizer, sanitary wipes and other items, after the four-hour period to drop off donations ended Thursday afternoon. Ajello and Hockaday then shuttled the supplies to University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, headquartered in Bel Air. The school system has been sharing medical supplies with the health system prior to Thursday, and the donation drive is the most recent aspect of that initiative, according to HCPS spokesperson Jillian Lader. There have been multiple community efforts in Harford County to secure personal protective equipment, or PPE, and donate them so hospital workers, health care providers and others working on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic have enough protective gear on hand. “In this challenging time, it’s important that we come together as a community,” HCPS Superintendent Sean Bulson said in a statement. “Our nurses saw a need and worked together to quickly find a way to support the hospital staff,” Bulson continued. “We hope that it makes a difference in their day, as we know they are working around the clock at the hospital to ensure the safety of our entire community.” Ana Jakse, school nurse for Forest Lakes Elementary School in Forest Hill, brought gloves, hand sanitizer, surgical masks, N95 respirator masks as well as thermometers — some of those thermometers were provided to the school by the local health department, according to Jakse. The small devices could go to families that do not have thermometers, Jensen said. “I gave what I could,” Jakse said as she talked with Jensen. Jakse has signed on with Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps and gone through their online training program in order to support those working in the medical field during the coronavirus crisis. “You see your fellow nurses struggling, and it hurts,” she said. The Medical Reserve Corps is set up to provide a network of volunteers to support public health and medical workers during times of crisis, according to the MRC web page. Jensen said she has signed up for the reserve corps, too, and plans to do her training this week. Jensen has been with HCPS for about 16 years and also has worked in a hospital setting. She is one of two float nurses in the school system and is responsible for mentoring new school nurses and providing orientation and training, as well as filling in during vacancies. She discussed how valuable the supplies collected Thursday are for medical workers. “Ideally, any patient that you’re caring for, you’re wearing gloves, you’re wearing some sort of protective gear,” she said. Health care workers should “definitely” have full protective gear if treating someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19, including a gown, gloves, N95 respirator and face shield, according to Jensen. She said an N95 mask is ideal for health care workers because it not only protects the worker while interacting with the patient, but the patient is protected from any illness the worker might have. “A surgical mask is just going to protect others from anything that you may have,” Jensen said. Both surgical and N95 masks were among the supplies donated Thursday. Nurses keep busy Schools have been closed throughout Harford County, as well as the entire state, since mid-March on the orders of Gov. Larry Hogan, and they are slated to remain closed until at least April 24. Harford’s school nurses have kept busy through various methods, such as studying medical literature, volunteering and staying in touch with their school’s parents and students, based on interviews at the drop-off site. Jaske and Gottesfeld, the Hickory Elementary nurse, have been keeping in touch with their schools’ families and sending them electronic newsletters. Jaske said she has been working to educate families on health issues and encouraging them to obtain free meals that are available at various pick-up sites around the county. Gottesfeld said she has been calling families and checking in with them, especially families of students with high-risk medical needs. She also worked with the Hickory school counselor to put together the newsletter, which is designed to give students “fun and creative things to do from a health and wellness perspective.”

Models show coronavirus infection ‘peaking probably around Fourth of July,’ Maryland health agency official says
.W
Maryland’s outbreak of the new coronavirus is on pace to peak around July 4, a state Health Department official told members of the Maryland elections board, although outside health experts cautioned against predictions involving a certain date because a lot is unknown or could change. Webster Ye, director of the Health Department’s office of governmental affairs, delivered the sobering timeline to board members Wednesday as they weighed decisions about the state’s upcoming elections. Ye said Maryland was in the “middle of the pack” with its infection rate compared with other states. “New York state, for example, is way above, and states like Nebraska are way below," Ye said. “We’re expecting this to be peaking probably around Fourth of July, so that’s probably when it gets the worst.” “If that happens,” Ye continued, "that means we will have done our job because we have slowed down hospital capacity demands. If we get a sudden spike in the next two weeks, that means we probably haven’t done our jobs because we’re going to be overwhelmed.” In a radio interview Friday, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan dismissed Ye’s statements. “The health department disputed that,” Hogan said. “That guy who works for the health department I think just made up his own personal opinion to some group and it got quoted in the paper. He’s not in any of our discussions or our meetings. ... It’s something he never expressed to anyone else.” The governor said there are various models showing different lengths of the pandemic in Maryland, but no one is sure what is the best prediction. “Nobody has the exact time,” Hogan said. “There are numerous models that show four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks or longer. The federal government doesn’t have an answer. We don’t have an answer.” Ye’s office is the health department’s liaison to the General Assembly and the federal government. According to the Maryland Manual, the state archives’ guide to government, the office of governmental affairs works with state delegates and senators on legislation the health department needs and analyzes the impact of other bills on the agency. Ye told members of the election board that the estimate he provided was based upon internal modeling by the Health Department, as well as modeling from Johns Hopkins Medicine and the University of Maryland Medical System. Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore City health commissioner and George Washington University professor, said she was “surprised” anyone would make a prediction of the disease’s peak spread when the number of coronavirus infections is unknown. A lack of widespread testing in the U.S. has officials estimating where the virus trajectory is headed. “Not all patients with symptoms are even being tested. Many people are self-isolating at home,” Wen said. “And there are likely many more, even tens of thousands more, who have mild or no symptoms and don’t know they have COVID-19.” She cautioned the models Ye cited could be wrong. “What data we do have shows cases are accelerating now. We need to be preparing right now,” she said. Ye described the state’s effort to “flatten the curve” by slowing the number of people infected early in the virus’ spread. That helps the health care system absorb the cases. It’s done through aggressive measures, such as those taken by Hogan, to close schools and businesses to keep people apart. Public health officials believe the virus is largely spread through the air during person-to-person contact. Dr. Thomas Ingelsby, director of the John Hopkins’ Center for Health Security, said the number of cases will depend on the public’s response to those measures. “The timing and height of the peak will depend on the effectiveness of social distancing measures and decisions and actions around them in the time ahead,” he said. The virus could be impacted by other factors. Some public health officials have said they don’t know if the virus will slow in warmer months and come back with a second wave in the fall or later, or if it will peak and decline. Because it’s a new coronavirus, no one has immunity to it. A vaccine to prevent infection is in the works but not expected to be available for 12 to 18 months. Bob Atlas, CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association, echoed the uncertainty from this pandemic. “This event is unprecedented, so all forecasts have a range of uncertainty as to time and numbers,” he said. “Our hospitals are preparing for an influx of patients, taking into consideration the variables that go into the forecasts,” he said. “We would, again, stress how important it is for everyone to comply with social distancing and other safety measures. That way, whenever the peak arrives, it’s much more likely our hospitals will be able to care for everyone in need.” Ye offered several more statistics as board members discussed the risk of opening polling places during an April 28 special general election and a June 2 presidential primary. The state has just over 200,000 masks in its supply and isn’t getting many more from federal officials, Ye told the group. Maryland hospitals have just over 2,000 available hospital beds, 396 of which are in intensive-care units, Ye also said. About 1,000 ventilators are available, he told the board. After hearing the figures, election board members moved forward with a draft plan to block in-person voting in June and switch to mail-in ballots. Many public officials and health experts have been reluctant to estimate how long the coronavirus outbreak will last. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump drew the ire of public health leaders after he suggested he wanted to “have the country opened up” by Easter, less than three weeks away. Trump said he feared the restrictions being implemented across the country would do irreparable damage to the economy. Baltimore Sun reporter Luke Broadwater contributed to this article.

Baltimore Mayor Young freezes nonessential hiring, spending while city grapples with coronavirus pandemic
.W
Baltimore will freeze nonessential hiring and spending as it grapples with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack" Young announced Friday. The Democratic mayor asked the city finance department to make an exception for hiring police officers, paramedics, firefighters and other positions related to public safety. Other agencies can request an exemption if a prospective employee would fill a “critical service” position, Young said in a news release, with priority given to people who would provide essential services or generate revenue. The mayor said the the city must be “fiscally prudent as we navigate this unprecedented emergency.” The finance department is forecasting sharp declines in the city’s revenue sources as daily life is upended. The state ordered the closure of bars, restaurants, malls and other major economic drivers in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. As a result, the city expects to lose out on hotel taxes, convention center receipts, parking revenues and other sources of money for an unknown period of time. “The hiring and spending freeze represents a pair of necessary first steps to ensure that as revenues continue to decline, we remain in a position to quickly respond to the needs of our residents and first responders," Young said. The mayor declared a local state of emergency Wednesday. That allows the city to expedite procurements related to the pandemic.

2 coronavirus cases confirmed at Taneytown nursing home, plus 6 more at Westminster retirement community
.W
Two residents of a nursing home in Taneytown have tested positive for the coronavirus, the facility confirmed Tuesday, and Carroll County also announced six new cases at a Westminster retirement community. “Dear Lorien Taneytown Residents and Family Members: We are writing to inform you that two residents of Lorien’s Taneytown location have tested positive for COVID-19,” the April 7 letter reads, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The letter was attached to an email from Bernadette Beard, the administrator of Lorien Taneytown, according to its website. Lorien Health Services has nine locations. The company offers services such as skilled nursing, rehabilitation and assisted living at the the Taneytown location. “Our priority, first and foremost, is the protection and care of our residents and staff,” JoAnn Presbitero, vice president of Lorien Health Services, wrote in an email Wednesday afternoon, confirming the two cases at the Taneytown facility. “Lorien continues to work carefully under the guidance of the local and state health departments, trusted medical professionals, and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to mitigate the spread of the virus.” Presbitero said family of residents were notified, as well as staff who were in contact with the patients. The April 7 letter further states residents and staff who were in “close contact” with the COVID-19 patients are “following proper protocol.” Beard did not immediately return an email or phone call Wednesday afternoon. As of April 8, Carroll County had announced a total of 192 confirmed cases and 19 deaths. Of those, 17 deaths have been reported at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, one was a resident of Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster and another was a member of the wider community. At Pleasant View, 81 residents and 31 staff members have tested positive. Six new cases were confirmed among Carroll Lutheran Village residents Wednesday, bringing the total there to 18 residents, plus two staff members. County officials also announced the first case of someone between the ages of 10 and 19. A total of 77 cases — up from 54 Tuesday — have been reported among people in the “community,” that is, not residents or staff of an elder care facility. Of those 77, 40 are women and 37 are men, while 14 are between the ages of 20 and 29; seven are between ages 30 and 39; 12 between ages 40 and 49; 30 between ages 50 and 59; nine between ages 60 and 69; and two people each between the ages of 70 and 79, and 80 and 89. Elder care facilities are especially threatened in the outbreak because older adults and people with compromised health are at higher risk of death from the coronavirus. According to the letter, Lorien is working under the guidance of local and state health departments, medical professionals, and the CDC to mitigate the spread of the disease. “Universal masking” began throughout Lorien facilities April 2, the letter states. Upon entering the facility, employees must have their temperature checked, and anyone with a fever is immediately sent home. Any employee with signs of illness is immediately sent home. In addition, according to a March 30 letter from the company’s CEO, Lou Grimmel Sr., “We also diligently monitor, and if needed exclude, staff who have worked at another facility with a positive case of COVID-19. They are not permitted to come back to work until they are cleared by the local health department.” In response to an executive order by Gov. Larry Hogan, Lorien created two new units in its buildings. Any new admission or resident returning from the hospital who is COVID-19 negative will be placed in the admission unit for 14 days and monitored. Any resident that is COVID-19 positive within the facility or diagnosed COVID-19 positive while in the hospital and is returning to the facility will be moved to the COVID-19 unit. Some residents may be asked to temporarily relocate to other rooms, the letter states. Lorien residents and family members received another letter April 8, this time from Grimmel. The letter clarified that the new units were created in the nursing homes (sub-acute rehab buildings) and not in the assisted living buildings. The March 30 letter from Grimmel, posted on Lorien’s website, outlined the facility’s prevention plan. “Due to the dramatic rise in COVID-19 cases over the last several days, all outside providers — including hospice, home health, behavioral health, and wound care — are restricted from entering the buildings, unless it is for a true medical necessity,” the letter reads. Protocol to be followed, according to the March 30 letter, includes: Caring for residents with undiagnosed respiratory illness using standard, contact, and droplet precautions with eye protection (i.e. gown, gloves, N95 or facemask, and face shield or goggles). Necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) is available immediately outside of the resident room and in other areas where resident care is provided.  Restricting visitors from Lorien facilities except for extenuating circumstances such as end-of-life situations.  Canceling communal dining and group activities.  Encouraging social distancing.  Transferring residents in need of a higher level of care to another facility.  Escalating cleaning practices.  Encouraging residents to wash hands frequently.  Providing hand sanitizer in every resident’s room.  Educating residents about COVID-19. A resident suspected of having or confirmed to have COVID-19 should be cared for using precautions such as a gown, gloves, N95 mask, face mask, shield or goggles, the March 30 letter states. A resident that is suspected of having or is confirmed to COVID-19 should be placed in a private room. Only residents or staff with symptoms will be tested. Westminster resident Marie Rogers looks forward to seeing her mother, Susan Gubernatis, again when the nursing home allows visitors. Gubernatis, 74, has been a Lorien Taneytown resident for several years, Rogers said. She usually visits her mother weekly to catch up and practice piano. Gubernatis studied at the Peabody Institute and taught piano for some time, Rogers said. She still gets great joy from performing at the nursing home. Rogers did not find fault with how Lorien staff have communicated with her family throughout the pandemic. She trusts they are keeping her mother separate from those with COVID-19. “The staff there’s been wonderful. They’re like family,” Rogers said. She sent her mother flowers for her birthday last month and video chats with her often. “I can’t wait to be able to see my mom again,” she said.

South Carroll: Winfield fire department takes steps to reduce risk, kept serving during coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Winfield Community Volunteer Fire Department is taking actions in response to the coronavirus pandemic to protect first responders and patients. The actions taken at the Winfield fire company are similar to actions being taken countywide during the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Chief Mark E. Davis, of the Winfield fire department said in an email that the fire department is following the state protocols established by the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems (MIEMSS). Davis also emphasized that the expectations and protocols change constantly as the pandemic continues to grow in the state. “These changes are important as they do represent best practices, but they also require daily engagement by all emergency responders … which can present a challenge in a combination volunteer/paid system like Winfield’s,” he said. “Our folks have to monitor the daily notices closely to see what might have changed since the day before.” According to Davis, the first responders at the fire department have always worn gloves, but because of the pandemic, in addition to the gloves, they have to wear surgical masks and eye protection on every EMS call and with every patient encounter. He also added that when the crews receive information that the patient may have flu-like symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 exposure, then the level of protective equipment use is increased to an N95 mask, a protective gown or a Tyvek suit, and eye protection. Unfortunately, Davis said the supply of N95 masks and surgical masks is limited, so responders have to be careful about exhausting the supply. “We are hopeful to receive more supplies in the coming days, but the outlook is slim at this point,” Davis added. In addition, Davis said the fire department has the following three important guiding principles regarding COVID-19 exposure during the crisis: “to protect our responders (meaning protective equipment and processes), protect our membership (meaning those folks who support our operation but do not calls), and protect the public.” “If we meet the first two principles, then protecting the public occurs by default. If we cannot protect our responders, then we cannot protect the public … we will have no one to respond,” Davis said. The fire department has implemented other actions to protect the living quarters. Davis said they are limiting public access, limiting the number of members gathering at one time, and implementing more strict hygiene and disinfection processes. “To say that the current COVID-19 situation presents a real challenge to local volunteer fire departments is a real understatement,” Davis said. He also added that the fire department has at least three paid staffers working at any hour of any day, and they provide staffing for fire and EMS apparatus. He also emphasized that they depend on their volunteer members to provide the remaining staffing on all of the calls. “Like many local departments, our number of volunteer responders has declined in recent times, which now only places further strain on our available response force,” Davis said. “However, we are committed to provide the best service possible given the available resources. This COVID-19 outbreak is like nothing we have seen in our lifetime … we will get through it … but not without everyone’s help.” For more information, you may contact the fire department at 410-795-1333.

Johns Hopkins Hospital 'provider’ has coronavirus, interacted with patients and clinicians
.W
A person identified as a “provider” at Johns Hopkins Hospital has tested positive for the new coronavirus, the hospital confirmed late Friday. It was not immediately clear whether the person was among the 19 confirmed cases reported to date by state and county authorities in Maryland. “The Maryland Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently confirmed, through testing, a provider at the Johns Hopkins Hospital who has the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19,” said Kim Hoppe, senior director of public relations and corporate communications for Johns Hopkins Medicine. “The provider is currently at home recovering,” she added. “Out of an abundance of caution and per our institutional policies and discussion with state authorities, all patients, clinicians and staff who may have been in contact with the provider have been identified and instructed to self-quarantine as directed.” Hoppe would not identify the patient, the patient’s gender or position at the medical institution. The term “provider” usually refers to a person who provides medical care or counseling services at a hospital or clinic. A hospital spokeswoman on Saturday also declined to provide additional details. "We remain committed to the safety of our patients, clinicians and our staff, and will continue to provide updates as this situation evolves,” Hoppe said. Medical providers are considered to be at high risk for contracting the virus. Last week, officials in Connecticut reported that a doctor who had made rounds at Bridgeport Hospital had the virus while an employee of hospitals in Danbury and Norwalk also tested positive for the virus. Both the doctor and the hospital employee are residents of New York. As many as 25 health care workers in Washington state were monitored for the virus after a man in his 50s died at a nursing facility in late February. Some nurses in Westchester County, New York, were quarantined after a patient was treated at the Bronxville hospital where they work. Seven more people in Maryland have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the state’s total number of confirmed cases to 19, officials said Friday.

Groups, council members push Mayor Young to house Baltimore’s homeless at hotels during coronavirus outbreak
.W
A group of homeless advocacy organizations and Baltimore City Council members are stepping up their call to have the homeless population housed at vacant hotels during the coronavirus outbreak, asking for the mayor to work to get hundreds of rooms ready to shelter the vulnerable population. In a conference call Monday led by the Housing Our Neighbors homeless advocacy group, a group that included Councilmen Ryan Dorsey and Zeke Cohen called on Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young to greatly expand the city’s efforts to rehouse the homeless. While the mayor’s office wrote in a news release that it has started to move 150 “vulnerable, but healthy, individuals” over the age of 62 from its emergency shelters to motels, Matt Hill, attorney for the Public Justice Center, said it would take 600 to 750 rooms to adequately address the problem. “The mayor’s office has told us they have reserved some hotel rooms and they’re looking to reserve a good number more,” Hill said, adding that it would take hundreds more “to really be able to offer housing to all of the people in congregate housing.” Young’s spokesman Lester Davis said the mayor agrees with the goal but wants to make sure any hotel space reserved for the homeless would be properly staffed. “The actual physical space is really the easy part,” Davis said, adding that the difficult part is making sure “they actually have the support that they need to be able to do well in those spaces.” In a statement released after Young’s announcement Monday afternoon, the Baltimore Fair Development Roundtable, which wrote the original letter to Young, said the group is “glad to see the Mayor’s office is beginning to take a step in the right direction.” “The Mayor must step up and commit to protecting all homeless in shelters and encampments,” the group wrote. “Everyone is at risk from the Covid-19 crisis and all are in need of safe housing.” Dorsey and Cohen expressed during the conference call their support for an expanded effort. “This is a human rights crisis. We’ve got to act with urgency and make sure that all of our neighbors are able to stay in a safe place,” Cohen said in a prerecorded video. Dorsey said the request is “not out of line with what other cities are doing” and that, with rooms sitting vacant as people stay home due to the coronavirus outbreak, “we just know they’re not doing as much as is possible.” City Councilwoman Shannon Sneed, who represents the 13th District, was initially on a conference call at 10 a.m. but had to drop out when the meeting was pushed back to around 10:45 a.m. due to the Zoom meeting being bombarded by pornography from anonymous users. Rachel Kutler, an advocate with Housing Our Neighbors, said Sneed had an 11 a.m. meeting she needed to attend. Other cities have taken action to move homeless populations away from smaller homeless shelters toward individual hotel rooms or to a more spacious location, as San Diego did when it moved 350 homeless people to a convention center. As of Monday, more than 900 individuals and dozens of organizations have signed onto a letter sent to Young and city leaders last month calling on the city to rapidly rehouse the city’s homeless in hotel rooms as well as implement rent and mortgage forgiveness measures. Mark Council, 60, who has been staying at the Weinberg Housing and Resource Center, said shelters are still taking care of hundreds of clients in tight quarters despite the federal government’s recommendations that individuals stay at least 6 feet away from one another. “Being in a shelter and trying to keep things the way want us to stay apart, it is very impossible to keep us apart from one another in the shelter,” he said. “How can we the people in the shelter stop the spread of the coronavirus if we are piled on top of one another?” Dr. Gwen DuBois, president of Chesapeake Physicians for Social Responsibility, said the issue is of urgent concern, considering how easily and quickly the virus can spread. “We can’t wait for people to have symptoms because we know they’re transmitting the virus even before they’re symptomatic,” DuBois said. “We need the mayor and governor to work together to rapidly find housing for the homeless.” Davis said the mayor is in contact with nonprofit and support organizations to try to move more people into hotel rooms, but stressed that the city wants “to make sure we have the staffing capacity.” “We’re scaling up as quickly as we can,” Davis said. “We are in alignment with the goal, and it’s something that the mayor is working to.”

Precautions to take How to prepare Aside from wiping down surfaces, washing hands with soap and refraining from touching your face, Marylanders should prepare to work from home and brace themselves for closures of schools, businesses, airports and governments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed their guidance on wearing cloth face coverings in public settings earlier this month, writing that those who are in situations “in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain” should wear cloth face coverings. U.S. health officials initially told citizens that masks do not provide benefits to average, healthy citizens. However, as officials balance saving surgical masks for medical personnel with the news the disease can spread from hosts who are asymptomatic, officials have updated their guidance to recommend people make cloth masks out of common household items. “The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators,” the CDC wrote. “Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.” Call before you go to get tested This will help medical professionals take steps to keep others from getting infected or exposed, the CDC website states. If you think you have the coronavirus, if possible, put on a face mask before coming into contact with other people or entering a facility and ask the health care provider to call the local or state health department. What to know if you get laid off More than 126,000 Marylanders were among a record 10 million Americans who filed for unemployment in the second half of March — so many that the claims are overloading the system.

As the coronavirus spreads, Maryland’s addiction treatment centers are forced to adapt
.W
Maryland’s addiction treatment centers are limiting group settings and plan to transition some services to online as they work to protect a vulnerable population from the spread of the new coronavirus. As the state continues to see an increasing number of cases of COVID-19, treatment providers are taking additional measures to protect medical personnel and drug users undergoing treatment. The state has 37 confirmed cases of the virus as of Monday. Gaudenzia, which owns and operates six facilities in Baltimore City and Anne Arundel County, is limiting group sessions to 20 people or fewer and is shifting schedules to accommodate the smaller group sizes, regional director Kristy Blalock said. Nonessential staff members, such as those who handle billing or administrative tasks, have been asked to work from home, Blalock added. The administrator of the Baltimore Intergroup Council of Alcoholics Anonymous said the vast majority of meetings in the Baltimore and Washington metropolitan area have moved online after she sent an email last week asking the approximately 500 groups in the region to look at hosting the meetings virtually. Jen G., who declined to give her full last name because of the group’s anonymous nature, added that AA groups do maintain autonomy and some have decided to continue to meet in-person. But she has continually received emails and letters from different groups saying they’ll be moving their meetings to online chats via Zoom or other platforms, she said. Peter D’Souza, CEO of Hope House in Anne Arundel County, said the addiction treatment provider is evaluating which outpatient programs could be held remotely. But with several inpatient treatment programs requiring that staff be made available 24 hours a day to monitor patients, Blalock said Gaudenzia “is still functioning much as we were two weeks ago.” “Our concern is having clients freak out and leave treatment,” Blalock said. Gaudenzia and other treatment centers are keeping those inpatient services operating at regular capacity and continuing to admit patients, but are taking extra steps to screen patients and staff for the virus. Representatives with Gaudenzia, Delphi Behavioral Health Group and Hope House, which all provide addiction treatment services, said they are regularly screening patients and staff for symptoms attributed to the virus, such as a fever or shortness of breath. Treatment centers are restricting outside access to those facilities, telling family members and outside groups they will not be able to visit the centers while the coronavirus outbreak is still active. Dominic Sirianni, CEO of Delphi, said the provider has restricted access to its facilities to singular entrances to keep a better eye on who enters and leaves. D’Souza said patients are no longer allowed to go to outside events and the center has increased its programs offered to people in inpatient facilities “in order to keep them occupied.” He said he’s also directed nonessential staff to work from home and has had a couple of nurses call out of work because of concerns that they work among vulnerable populations like the elderly when they’re not helping at the clinic. “We have a skeleton crew, but we have not yet got to the point where the staff is so few where we have to cut programming or where we have to cut admissions,” D’Souza said. The three providers said they’re aggressively adhering to guidelines outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, having staff members and patients wash their hands constantly and practice social distancing whenever appropriate, such as during group therapy sessions. Adrienne Breidenstine, spokeswoman for Behavioral Health System Baltimore, said the agency is making an extra effort to reach out to the drug-using population about the risks of coronavirus. She said the agency is trying to make the users aware of the risks they face as a result of their habit, whether talking to them about the dangers of using dirty syringes or how they could be at greater risk of contracting the disease at homeless shelters if they’re not practicing social distancing and safe health practices. Breidenstine added that the agency is talking with providers about coordinating certain services through TeleHealth, which allows providers to distribute some health-related services virtually. D’Souza said his organization is evaluating certain outpatient groups to see whether they could conduct their meetings virtually. While the state has given guidance on how to stem the spread of the disease, Sirianni said he wants more guidance on what happens if a patient tests positive for the coronavirus. All of the providers said none of their patients tested positive for the disease. He said that while the center would stop admitting patients, what happens beyond that is up in the air. Patients in treatment regularly do not have a stable home to return to, if one at all, and quarantining them and the staff on-site would require Delphi to prepare food and resources for everyone still at the quarantined facility. “How do we wind down the site?” Sirianni said. “There might not be a good answer.”

Maryland launches page to help squash coronavirus rumors: ‘We want to separate fact from fiction’
.W
The state of Maryland on Tuesday debuted a “rumor control” website intended to keep residents informed and dispel rumors during the global pandemic. The page, created in partnership with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland Department of Health and the Maryland Department of Information Technology, allows Marylanders to read a variety of information about the coronavirus and how the pandemic is affecting life in Maryland and across the country. Visitors can also submit a rumor to be answered, subscribe to updates to be notified when a rumor has been identified and dispelled, and receive links to trusted sources and their social media posts in real time. “We want Maryland residents to be able to participate in the process by helping us identify rumors and false information that could unnecessarily cause panic or worse, result in decision making that could lead to severe injuries or even death," Jorge E. Castillo, spokesperson for the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, wrote in a news release. Rumors addressed on the page include topics such as food delivery, elements of the stay-at-home order and how the virus is spread. “We want to separate fact from fiction,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday in an appearance on the “PBS NewsHour.” “It’s important people hear from the scientists and the doctors.”

Carroll Hospital offering drive-up coronavirus testing for those with doctor’s referral
.W
Carroll Hospital is offering drive-up testing for the novel coronavirus, though that testing is only open to individuals who have been screened and referred by their physician. In a Friday morning interview, Carroll Hospital President and Executive Vice President of LifeBridge Health Leslie Simmons said the hospital has set up a specimen collection tent on the third floor of its parking garage to allow for the rapid testing of those suspected of having the novel coronavirus, but are not yet showing symptoms. Those specimens collected are then sent to LabCorp for analysis, with results taking three to four days. “People can drive up to be tested, so it is mobile testing, however, they have to be screened first through their primary care provider, who is then referring them to a LifeBridge telehealth triaging system,” Simmons said. “We are utilizing the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines to determine who is at high risk, and if they meet high risk criteria, then they are referred to Carroll Hospital’s specimen collection tent.” The hospital tested two patients at the drive-up specimen collection tent Wednesday afternoon, according to Simmons, and while she said she could not communicate the numbers of people tested since then, she added “it’s very safe to say our numbers are increasing daily.” While the tent was initially open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., and then again from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., the facility was opened additional hours, from noon to 6 p.m., beginning Friday. The first Carroll County case of the coronavirus was announced Friday afternoon. State officials said Friday evening the total number of confirmed cases in Maryland has risen to 19. The drive up specimen collection tent is, Simmons believes, the first such setup in Maryland. (A Bel Air Hospital was scheduled to debut drive-up testing on Friday.) “I will tell you that Sinai is practicing their procedures today and hopes to be operational on Monday morning,” Simmons said. “They would be the second LifeBridge hospital doing it.” The drive-up tent on the parking garage is different than the tents Carroll Hospital has set up outside the emergency department, according to Simmons. “That tent is to actually treat patients that are presenting to our emergency department with symptoms, who are actually sick,” she said. Which led Simmons to the main message she hoped to convey to people in Carroll County: That people with mild symptoms or who are at low risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms from the novel coronavirus should call their doctor or the health department hotline — 410-876-4848 — and avoid flooding the hospital emergency room unless directed there by their doctor. “The hospitals are going to get to capacity very quickly and we need to make sure we have space for the sickest of the sick," Simmons said. “We erected the tent outside the emergency department because we are concerned we will run out of capacity quickly and the tents will help us manage that to some degree.” Part of the reason for measures like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s decision to close Maryland schools for two weeks, and recommendations of social distancing and to self quarantine is because they can help slow the rate at which the coronavirus spreads, keeping the numbers the health care system must treat at any one time lower, according to Carroll County Health Department Health Planner Maggie Kunz. It’s a term called “flattening the curve.” “Flattening the curve means that we slow the spread of the disease, COVID-19, so that not as many people get sick at the same time,” Kunz said. “When we flatten the curve and slow the spread, we have less cases at one time so we don’t overburden the healthcare system. This allows people who are sick to get the care they need.” Which is why Simmons, when asked for other recommendations for people concerned about coronavirus, reiterated the recommendations that have been made for weeks: “Wash your hands, cough in your sleeve, stay away from large gatherings and quarantine yourself." Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the health department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 am. through 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/. As of Friday afternoon, the coronavirus had resulted in 40 deaths in the United States out of about 1,700 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic Wednesday.

Old Town: Laurel Historical Society begins to document life during coronavirus pandemic
.W
As members of the Laurel Historical Society worked last year to put together an exhibit documenting the city’s 150th anniversary of incorporation, members noticed major gaps in collection pieces. There were few or no photos of some previous major anniversary celebrations, even in years when cameras were prevalent. Some other historical items of interest had little documentation save a line or two in a newspaper. So, when the coronavirus pandemic struck last month, the society knew what it had to do: document, document, document. The historical society, which has worked for more than 40 years to preserve Laurel’s rich past and share its story with people of today, suddenly tasked itself with preserving the present to share with the future. It had to not only look back, but forward. “We want to capture these memories and stories as they are happening,” said Ann Bennett, the society’s executive director. “We are really benefiting from recent work on the [150th anniversary] exhibit and the perspective we now have of what it takes to tell a complete story of a community.” The Laurel Historical Society already has started a coronavirus collection and has appealed to residents to share photos, videos or stories that document life in Laurel at this time. Examples of collection items include photos of shuttered Main Street businesses and empty shelves at local grocery stores, or the note found on the website of Laurel’s popular Pasta Plus restaurant that it is closed for the time being. The society has asked residents who hung 150th anniversary signs in their windows on April 4 to save them and donate them to the museum when it reopens. Electronic contributions may be sent to info@laurelhistoricalsociety.org. “We want to make sure we are documenting this as best we can so that generations later we will have a complete picture of what life was like during this time,” Bennett said. The historical society is also making efforts to continue to educate and engage the community while the Laurel Museum is shuttered. The pandemic struck just six weeks into the museum’s scheduled 10-month run of its current exhibit, “Unpacking Laurel’s Past: 150 Years on Display,” which commemorates the 150th anniversary of the city’s incorporation. Bennett was able to make a few videos of exhibit highlights before the museum shut down and those videos are available on the historical society’s website, YouTube and Facebook. Assistant Director Monica Sturdivant created a coloring book of exhibit highlights for children that can be found online. The historical society website also features a virtual jigsaw puzzle, a virtual scavenger hunt, a “spot the difference” game and a children’s diary template to document life during the pandemic. They may be found at laurelhistoricalsociety.org. The society faces many of the same challenges as other small nonprofits as the pandemic continues. Bennett said that it appears the group’s budget will take a “substantial hit.” Its annual gala, a major fundraising event scheduled for April 4, was postponed. The historical society hopes it can be rescheduled for the fall, Bennett said, but that is still uncertain. Other events — some tied in with city anniversary celebrations — were scrapped. It will be difficult to raise funds as many families face dire economic straits of their own. The group is working to identify internal cost-cutting measures and has also applied for a grant from the state and a loan from the Small Business Association. The society is also considering how the museum and events will function when the lockdown is lifted. Will guests want to attend a gala with hundreds of other people, for example, or will parents allow children to touch the interactive Diven’s Den historical play space in the museum’s basement? There are so many unknowns and Bennett said the perspective of a historian at this time is both “a blessing and a curse.” “The parallels to the Great Depression are very frightening,” she said. “But it’s also comforting to know these things are cyclical and our community has survived really bad things. The story is still one of hope and opportunity. Our community will get through this.”

Maryland prisoners on edge as coronavirus threat grows and courts consider how to release some inmates
.W
As the coronavirus pandemic ravages Maryland and the number of cases in its jails and prisons grow, inmate Travis Gary says little has changed inside to indicate corrections officials are doing enough to address the risk. He now has a bunkmate in his cell after living alone, making social distancing difficult. Four washing machines are broken, prison officials said, and Gary’s seen no urgency to fix them. No face masks have been provided, so he fashioned one out of a pair of long johns. “The conditions are filthy. They are not giving us masks. The only thing they are doing is taking our temperature," Gary said in a recent phone interview from the Baltimore City Correctional Center, where he’s been held on weapons and drug charges since 2017. Inmates and guards in Maryland’s prisons and jails, and their families, say officials have not taken sufficient steps to protect them from COVID-19, even as the illness has killed its first inmate — a man in his 60s who died Saturday at the Jessup Correctional Institution. The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services announced that death Monday, along with the tally of 93 cases among inmates, officers and contractors at state prisons, a fivefold increase since April 3. On Tuesday, Maryland Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera ordered the trial courts to identify and release prisoners statewide who are at-risk for the coronavirus and pose no threat to public safety. With her order, Barbera opens the door for prisoners to be released on a case-by-case basis, although the full impact of the move likely won’t be clear for days. Some of America’s prisons and jails have become infested with the virus. The Cook County jail in Chicago is the nation’s top hotspot for infections, according to data tracked by The New York Times. So far, Gov. Larry Hogan has not heeded calls from civil rights groups, medical leaders and prosecutors including Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby to sharply reduce the prison population. All have called on Hogan to release certain older, immuno-compromised and parole-eligible prisoners. They also called for additional steps to regulate Maryland’s prison facilities, including providing sanitizing wipes at phone stations to reduce person-to-person transmission. Hogan has ignored the calls so far, and the prison system says that it is properly caring for inmates and ramping up efforts to provide staff and prisoners with proper protective equipment and sanitizer. “Every inmate is in the process of receiving a sneeze guard [protective face mask],” said Mark Vernarelli, a corrections department spokesman. “Incarcerated individuals in quarantine or isolation, due to suspected or confirmed exposure to COVID-19, are provided surgical masks for the protection of themselves and others.” Inmates such as Gary said much of the information that has been given out by the Maryland Division of Corrections does not reflect reality. Outside of the Baltimore City Correctional Center last week, inmates could be heard shouting through open windows about their fear of contracting the virus. Gary’s wife, Felicia Gary, said her husband used to be in a single cell, but since the outbreak the facility added another inmate. Gary said neither man has been tested, and that they each received only a small bar of soap, about the size you’d get in a hotel room, two months ago. The ration hasn’t changed, even as officials call for staff and inmates to wash their hands more than ever, Gary said. Gary is especially concerned about coronavirus risk, he said, because he has asthma; if he contracts COVID-19, he has a higher chance of becoming very ill, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another inmate in the Baltimore City Correctional Center, John Waters III, said he also suffers from asthma and fears for his health and life. In a telephone interview, Waters, who has not been tested, said he often walks around using a mask he made out of a hat. Waters, 28, who was sent to prison in 2017, according to Maryland court records, said he was approved for work-release in February and believes his “safety and health are not only in jeopardy, but in serious threat." Waters was charged with armed robbery and firearm offenses in 2016, court records show. “I have been nothing but positive throughout my entire sentence, but I don’t want this to be the last chapter of my life,” said Waters, adding that he wants to see his 3-year-old son. The department has not confirmed any cases inside the Baltimore City Correctional Center. The union representing corrections officers also has complained that members have been left out of the loop on news of coronavirus cases inside prisons. “It is tragic that at a time where transparency and teamwork are at a premium, officers must continue to receive word of new suspected and confirmed COVID-19 through word-of-mouth rather than their supervisors and the wardens,” said Patrick Moran, AFSCME Council 3 President. The union says the department can and should “take action today” to protect officers and inmates or many will “lose their life due to their inaction.” The American Civil Liberties Union last week again petitioned for prisoners to be released, saying the reluctance to do so is a “blind spot” in Maryland leadership. “Prisons and jails are not hermetically sealed. Once the virus enters a detention center, the regular movement of staff in and out of the facility means that the virus will spread back to the community,” the petition reads. Prison officials say they are taking inmates’ safety seriously. Staff at all Maryland corrections facilities are required to wear more protective gear. Each correctional employee is provided a face shield, gloves and a protective face mask, also referred to as a sneeze guard, Vernarelli said. The corrections department is prioritizing protective equipment for prisoners at facilities where people have tested positive for the virus, he said. Vernarelli said last week that the department is making more protective equipment, including 12,000 sneeze guards, 10,000 plastic face shields, 1,400 gowns and 2,000 bottles of hand sanitizer. After a person tests positive, the department’s COVID-19 response team begins “contact tracing” to locate any staff member, inmate, detainee, or others who may have had contact, Vernarelli said. But prisoner advocates and health officials said nothing will be enough if the prison population isn’t drastically reduced soon. Leonard Rubenstein, director of the program on Human Rights, Health and Conflict for Johns Hopkins University, said there needs to be equal effort for releasing prisoners and keeping them safe while they remain inside. “Getting them out makes more space in the facilities, but regardless, make sure the people in the facility have the proper means to protect themselves,” he said. “That means things like soap, hand sanitizer and masks should be readily available.” As of April 3, nearly 60 inmates have been released from Baltimore jails according to the Maryland Judiciary. The release of inmates began March 18 and has continued since. The defendants released were awaiting trial in the Baltimore City Detention Center, the judiciary said. The judiciary did not respond to a request for updated inmate release numbers.

Baltimore Council President Scott pushes for racial breakdown in city coronavirus cases
.W
Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott introduced a bill Monday night requiring the city health commissioner report patients’ races and ZIP codes during a health emergency, a move designed to produce data that’s not been made public in Maryland during the coronavirus pandemic. Scott and the 14-member council, all Democrats, are among a growing chorus of lawmakers calling for a breakdown of COVID-19 cases by race, alongside already-public data on patients’ gender, age and county. In a highly segregated city, where a person’s life expectancy varies dramatically based on what area they live in, Scott said this information is vital. “We have to make sure we are tracking the data and putting it out in a public fashion to ensure resources are brought to bear in these communities,” he said. Scott joins dozens of members of the Maryland House of Delegates in pushing for this information. Eighty state lawmakers have signed a letter urging the state health department to release data on coronavirus cases broken down by race. For more than a week, Baltimore Democrat Del. Nick Mosby has been leading the charge to get more details on the people getting sick and dying of COVID-19. He said early access to racial data could help officials spot disparities early in the crisis. A spokesman for Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, Mike Ricci, said last week that the state is seeking information about the races of patients from testing sites. Other states already have published preliminary data on the races of coronavirus patients, which showed black people were disproportionately affected. Both District of Columbia and city of Chicago officials released a breakdown by race Monday. In Chicago, about 70% of people who have died from COVID-19 are black. Roughly 30% of Chicago residents are black. Chicago is now launching a health campaign focused on the city’s black and brown communities, Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Monday. Black people in America suffer higher rates of asthma and diabetes — the kinds of underlying health conditions that could put patients at a greater risk of COVID-19 complications. Researchers also are concerned about how doctors’ implicit biases could impact patient care. Baltimore’s population is more than 60% black. Prince George’s County, also more than 60% black, has seen the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths in Maryland so far: 23. The threat from the new coronavirus loomed large at Monday’s council meeting, the first in Baltimore history to be held entirely online. Hogan has banned large gatherings of people in an attempt to slow the spread of the highly contagious virus. Scott was the only member in the council chamber; others joined in from offices or homes, with Democratic Councilman Isaac “Yitzy” Schleifer appearing outdoors. Other than a few technical hiccups, the meeting progressed smoothly as the council considered coronavirus-related bills as well as regular city business. “We’ll do whatever we have to to show the citizens of Baltimore we’re getting to work amid this crisis,” Scott said. The council passed a resolution requesting the city law department appeal a recent U.S. District Court decision that found a Baltimore air quality ordinance passed last year is invalid. “The judge made a bad call,” said Democratic Councilman Ed Reisinger. The law imposed strict emissions regulations on the city’s two waste incinerators, the Wheelabrator waste-to-energy plant near the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore and a medical waste plant in Curtis Bay. The judge ruled the city law undermines federal regulation of the plants. “We believe the court made the correct ruling on March 27 and are confident an appeal would result in the same interpretation of applicable law...," Wheelabrator said in a statement Monday. The council also gave final approval to two proposed charter amendments, the source of much tension between the legislative body and the mayor. One would reduce the number of council votes needed to override a mayoral veto from three-fourths to two-thirds, and the other would modify how long the council has to consider overriding a veto. Any charter amendment ultimately needs the direct approval of voters in a referendum. The council also sought an update on the city’s response to COVID-19 disease, and made several recommendations to both local and federal officials, including that unoccupied city-owned properties be used during the state of emergency to house people with nowhere else to live. Council members addressed residents directly at the end of the meeting, imploring them to take the governor’s stay-at-home order seriously. Democratic Councilman Eric Costello said he would be asking the Recreation and Parks department to remove swings from city parks, after seeing families playing on them in Federal Hill — despite directives not to do so. At the end of every meeting, the council holds a moment of silence for the city’s homicide victims. This week, council members honored those who have died from COVID-19, too.

Amid coronavirus fears, Howard schools cancel all out-of-state field trips and athletic events
.W
Howard County schools Superintendent Michael Martirano has canceled all out-of-state field trips and athletic events due to concerns related to coronavirus, the school system announced Tuesday afternoon. All of Howard’s out-of-state field trips and athletic events, including those in Washington, D.C., are canceled through the end of the school year. All official out-of-state travel for school system employees also is canceled. Already-approved in-state field trips are being reassessed on a case-by-case basis. Families will be notified of any changes by Thursday. All in-state athletic travel will continue as planned. “The decision to cancel out-of-state field trips was made out of an abundance of caution to minimize risk to [Howard County Public School System] students, staff and families,” Martirano said in a statement. “This decision alone cannot completely eliminate the risk of exposure to this virus, so I remind all Howard County citizens to increase personal precautions and practice the healthy habits recommended by the Howard County Health Department.” The school system arrived at its decision after Gov. Larry Hogan canceled all out-of-state travel for state employees Monday. Anne Arundel County Public Schools canceled all out-of-sate and international field trips Monday. Baltimore County Public Schools also canceled field trips outside Maryland and Washington, D.C. Martirano said he is maintaining direct, daily contact with Dr. Maura Rossman, the county’s health officer. For additional resources and information, families can visit the school system’s coronavirus page on its website. There are eight confirmed cases of coronavirus in Maryland, state officials confirmed Tuesday afternoon. The cases are in Montgomery, Prince George’s and Harford counties.

State delegates, pastors and businesses file lawsuit against Hogan seeking to end coronavirus restrictions
.W
Maryland politicians, pastors and business owners banded together Saturday afternoon to file a sweeping federal lawsuit aimed at ending restrictions enacted by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan in response to the coronavirus. The lawsuit argues that the governor’s orders banning large gatherings and closing most businesses violate constitutional and federal laws protecting commerce, freedom of assembly, the right to protest and the right to practice their religion. Republican Dels. Dan Cox, Warren Miller and Neil Parrott argue that the restrictions against travel violate their duties to oversee Hogan and state government. The 56-page lawsuit taps into sentiment among some groups of protesters nationwide that governors have gone too far in efforts to contain the coronavirus. The plaintiffs mention a recent memo by U.S. Attorney General William Barr calling for federal prosecutors to be on the lookout for states that infringe on the rights of its citizens. And the lawsuit hits a consistent theme that the actions constitute a violation of first amendment protections of speech and religion. “Under the Governor’s Executive Orders, Lowes and Walmart are permitted to have hundreds of cars and people because the Governor chose them to be ‘essential” businesses,’ the lawsuit states. “However, under the same orders a church may not have anyone in its buildings with limited exceptions for ‘virtual’ services, and businesses that operate for camping or recreation or other provisions such as hair salons and a myriad of other businesses, are prohibited from even being open.” Cox, who is both a plaintiff and an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to multiple requests for comment Saturday night. Cox claims in the lawsuit that a “senior law enforcement official” whom he did not name dissuaded him from attending an event in Frederick Saturday to kick off a cross-state rally in support of lifting the restrictions. He claims the law enforcement official threatened that the delegate might be arrested. Cox said in the lawsuit that he asked two of Hogan’s advisers for written documentation that he could attend the rally in his role as a lawmaker, but the only response he received was a copy of the executive order banning large gatherings. Hogan has not reviewed the lawsuit and declined to comment through his spokesman, Mike Ricci. Ricci, however, had this to say about the lawsuit: “We fully respect Delegate Cox’s right to protest, but that doesn’t entitle him to make false and baseless claims. Also, I thought Republicans were the ones who didn’t like frivolous lawsuits.” The lawsuit names Hogan, Health Secretary Robert Neall, Deputy Health Secretary Fran Phillips and Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Woodrow W. Jones III as defendants. The plaintiffs also asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the executive orders. The owners of the Antietam Battlefield KOA campground in Williamsport are losing $50,000 per month due since they’ve been forced to close under the executive orders, according to the lawsuit. The owners of Adventure Park in New Market expect to lose $700,000 this spring. The plaintiffs include two military veterans who refuse to wear face coverings because it reminds them of battlefields in Iraq. And several pastors who are plaintiffs claim that their churches can’t hold online or outdoor drive-in worship services because they lack the equipment to do so. The group of plaintiffs also includes Reopen Maryland LLC, a group that has so far organized two demonstrations against the executive orders, including one on Saturday. The lawsuit claims the group is suffering “ongoing violations of constitutional rights.” Legal experts have said that Hogan is within his authorities outlined in state law, so long as his actions are not arbitrary and capricious. The Public Safety Article in the Maryland Code grants a governor broad authority in states of emergency and catastrophic public health events. The lawsuit argues that Hogan’s actions go beyond the scope of his authorities in the Maryland Code, which “do not include any powers to require the population to stay-at-home, wear face masks, refrain from assembling in church, refrain from doing business or participating in commerce.” It also argues that Hogan’s actions amount to violations of Constitutional rights.

Maryland adds 788 positive coronavirus cases to its total count, with 11,572 confirmed infections overall
.W
The Maryland Department of Health added 788 cases of the coronavirus to the state’s tally Friday for a total of 11,572 overall — and another 33 deaths pushed the fatality count to 425. The state also said there have been 69 additional deaths of those who probably died from the COVID-19 illness but whose cases have not been confirmed by a laboratory test. About 50,000 Marylanders have tested negative for the disease, according to the state’s report. The latest cases represent a 7% jump since Thursday and a nearly 30% increase in the count of positives since Monday, which could be attributed to the state’s expanding capacity to test. The health department also reported that another 161 people were hospitalized since Thursday for complications associated with the new virus, bringing the total hospitalized to 2,162. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has pledged to add thousands of beds to the state’s normal hospital capacity to aid in an expected surge in COVID-19 patients seeking treatment. It’s unclear how many beds already have been set up, though the Maryland Health Care Commission has approved the emergency addition of dozens of beds at facilities including Meritus Medical Center, University of Maryland Prince George’s Hospital Center, Northwest Hospital Center and the Baltimore Convention Center, among others, in recent weeks. Hogan cautioned that Maryland has not yet reached a peak of cases and deaths. “We’ve slowed the growth and we’ve blunted that curve, but we are unfortunately on the way up that slide,” the Republican governor said Friday morning during a teleconference with The Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “We believe we are getting close to the peak in the next week or so, but time will tell." Meanwhile, the state’s release of racial and ethnic data continues to reveal disparities between groups. Black Marylander account for about half of the cases and deaths in which race is known, while whites account for about 31% of those cases and 41% of those deaths. However, African Americans account for just 30% of the state’s population. The state began reporting this week the numbers of Hispanic people who have contracted and died from COVID-19. On Friday, Maryland’s Hispanic population made up 16% of the cases is which race is known, but just 5% of those deaths. Data remains unavailable for the racial and ethnic identities of more than one in five of the known cases. While Prince George’s County continues to outpace other counties in cases, the 21215 ZIP code in Baltimore and Baltimore County remains the most concentrated. Local leaders had pushed the state to make this data public, citing the need to allocate more resources to the most vulnerable communities, populations and neighborhoods. Hogan said that while the figures might appear grim, Marylanders should be encouraged by the progress made. “Our case numbers are still growing each day and the number of deaths is continuing to increase. But because of our early and aggressive actions and the extraordinary sacrifices of Marylanders, we are beginning to see some hopeful and encouraging signs, which have allowed us to begin laying the groundwork to reopen, to rebuild and to recover as soon as it is safe to do so,” he said.

East Middle School opens as coronavirus respite center for Carroll County’s homeless
.W
On Wednesday afternoon, Carroll County saw the first clients for a new temporary medical respite center on the Westminster campus of East Middle School that aims to support homeless people threatened by the coronavirus. First opened Monday evening, the center — a collection of large white tents and marked-off camping areas on the athletic fields near the Best Facility, a small satellite structure behind the main school building — is designed to safely shelter and support homeless people who are medically vulnerable, or even any who have COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “We are a medical respite, meaning people will have access to doctors who are doing rounds; there will be a medical doctor and a behavioral health doctor doing rounds each day here and multiple nurses on site during the day,” said Celene Steckel, director of the Carroll County Department of Citizen Services. “This is for homeless individuals who maybe have a general medical need for respite, but then also primarily for people who are COVID positive, or people who are awaiting test results.” The two men who arrived at the location Wednesday afternoon were of the first category, Steckel said, potentially at risk but not COVID-19 positive. “Currently we have no known folks in our homeless population that are either positive or awaiting results,” she said. “We hope it stays that way.” The location would also serve as a respite for anyone currently in the county’s year-round shelters, should they become symptomatic and need to wait on test results, she said. The medical respite site is a collaboration between Carroll County Public Schools, which is providing security; Access Carroll, which is providing medical support; Human Services Programs of Carroll County, which is providing for food and hygiene needs; the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office and Westminster Police Department, which will be doing regular patrols; and the county government, according to Steckel. Entry to the respite is only by referral. “Right now we are taking referrals from three entities,” Steckel said. “The Carroll County Health Department, Human Services Programs of Carroll County Inc., and [Carroll Hospital].” The Westminster armory building on Longwell Avenue had initially been considered, but the layout of the East Middle campus was determined to work better, Steckel said. Those on respite without any present COVID-19 concerns will initially be staying on cots in the small gymnasium in the Best Facility, she said, while those who wish to, or who are COVID-19 positive, will be able to camp on the athletic field. The county has arranged for a handful of the most vulnerable homeless people to stay in hotel rooms while awaiting potentially permanent housing, according to Rebekah Siebe, who does development and compliance for Access Carroll. But she said the outdoor arrangements at the respite site are actually ideal for preventing the potential spread of the novel coronavirus, with each campsite measured at 40 by 40 feet, and each row of sites separated by 12-foot aisles. “In a hotel all the surfaces you don’t know how many times have they been touched, how many times have they been cleaned,” she said, noting she has heard of health care workers camping in their own yards for the same reason, because of risk of contamination with their families." Many of the people who may use the medical respite site are already Access Carroll clients, Siebe said, and so in some ways their using the campsites could improve access to Access Carroll providers. “Some of them need case management from a behavioral health standpoint, and right now they are not coming into the office, but our case managers can come here and speak to them,” she said. “We’re going to take vitals, we’re going to take temperature checks. We want to make sure we catch those people; even if they are in general population now, it doesn’t mean that in three days they won’t start a temperature.” Anyone who is referred to the respite and is homeless and not currently known to the county’s homeless system will go through an intake process designed to connect them with resources, Steckel said. The idea being that the respite can serve not only to protect people from COVID-19, but to move them into a job or housing, or being the path of getting them connected to whatever resources they may lack. “We are getting some people into housing through the rapid rehousing program, and we are looking to ramp that up as this outbreak continues,” Steckel said. “We have the focus on the homeless people with the team pulling in and trying to get people into housing. That’s really the goal of this, in the end.”

Horizon Foundation donates $1 million in grants to Howard County organizations fighting the coronavirus
.W
The Horizon Foundation is donating $1 million in grants to various Howard County health institutions and organizations that are working during the coronavirus pandemic. Howard County General Hospital is receiving the largest grant of $500,000. This grant will go toward keeping all “frontline health care workers safe, housed and fed” during the pandemic, as well as providing technology to patients so they can be in touch with loved ones, according to a Monday news release. “Our team is working tirelessly to care for patients and this new gift will allow us to better support our staff on the front lines, especially as we prepare for a surge of patients in coming weeks,” Steve Snelgrove, president of Howard County General Hospital, said in a statement. “They are our heroes, and we want to make sure they have the support they need to continue to care for patients.” The Horizon Foundation, an independent philanthropy dedicated to improving the health and wellness of county residents, is spreading the funds among local mental health organizations, homeless shelters and residential programs, and is helping provide personal protective equipment to those in need. “The Horizon Foundation is committed to helping our community address rising needs, particularly for our heroes fighting the pandemic on the front lines and our most vulnerable community members,” Greg Olaniran, chair of the Horizon Foundation board, said in a statement. “Together, we will get through this.” Howard County has recorded at least 386 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and eight residents have died as of Monday, according to state officials. In addition to Howard County General Hospital, the grants are being divided between: Health Facilities Association of Maryland: $125,000 will go toward providing personal protective equipment, food and temporary housing for health care workers at 25 assisted living, skilled nursing and other alternative living facilities in the county  $100,000 will go toward supporting various organizations that assist with mental health needs  Humanim, a social impact organization focusing on human services throughout Maryland: $75,000 will go providing personal protective equipment for staff, food for health care workers and supporting safe distancing for individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities in residential programs  Chase Brexton Health Care: $50,000 will help provide technology to support telecommuting and telehealth opportunities and personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for staff  Gilchrist Hospice: $50,000 to provide personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies and technology for patients  Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center: $50,000 will go toward providing personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies for staff and temporary housing for homeless individuals and families  The Arc of Howard County: $50,000 will help provide personal protective equipment for staff and support safe distancing for individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities in Arc’s residential programs Last month, the Horizon Foundation, in collaboration with the Community Foundation of Howard County, United Way of Central Maryland and Women’s Giving Circle of Howard County, established HoCoRespond.com to raise funds to provide grants to nonprofits.  The website has received more than $100,000 in donations. The Horizon Foundation also plans to install banners this week at Howard County General Hospital that read, “Howard County’s Heroes Work Here.”

Four dead from coronavirus, 46 others test positive at Baltimore County nursing home
.W
Four residents have died of coronavirus at a Parkville assisted-living facility, and 46 others there have tested positive for the virus since the Baltimore County Health Department announced the outbreak earlier this month, according to a nursing home spokeswoman. Lori Mayer, a spokeswoman for Genesis Loch Raven Center, said staff are following “to the letter the direction of the Maryland Department of Health” to contain and minimize the virus. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these residents during this difficult time, especially the families of the four residents who passed away,” she wrote in an email. Ninety-two residents live at the post-hospital, rehabilitation and respite care facility on Emge Road. Nearly half of them — 44 residents — so far have tested positive for COVID-19. Fourteen staff members also have tested positive, Mayer said. One staff member so far is confirmed to have recovered and has been cleared to return to work. Mayer would not say if any others had recovered or how many were currently in self-quarantine. In total, 58 individuals at the facility have been found to contract the virus. Mayer would not disclose information about the residents who died. The 21234 ZIP code in which the nursing home is located contains 121 confirmed cases, according to ZIP code data released by the Maryland Department of Health this week. “The nursing home accounts for about a third of cases within that ZIP code,” said Baltimore County Councilman David Marks, whose district includes Parkville. “Clearly, the nursing home is a hotspot” and one of particular concern given the densely populated area’s older residential population, Marks said. Census data from 2018 shows nearly 14% of Parkville’s residents are older than 65 years old and 34% are black. Heritage Center in Dundalk, a Genesis Healthcare facility, now has six residents and four staff who have tested positive, according to Mayer. One of the residents who tested positive has died. Mayer said residents with coronavirus are being isolated in their rooms and that their families have been notified of their condition. Residents are being checked three times a day for their temperatures and symptoms. In a statement, Genesis HealthCare Chief Medical Officer Richard Feifer said the facilities have been able to maintain an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, including standard face masks, gowns, gloves and respirators “by shifting supplies among our facilities and resourceful sourcing.” “Up to this moment, we have had what we have needed to protect our staff, and have been able to obtain adequate supply,” Mayer said. Mayer said the Baltimore County facilities did not have ventilators for those who have tested positive, and that the facilities are reusing face masks for employees and following guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration to extend the use of face masks over multiple shifts. The nursing home, like other health care providers, is facing a shortage of personal protective equipment, Mayer said. “This is not a sustainable solution, so we are deeply concerned about [personal protective equipment],” Mayer said. Feifer added that more federal government assistance to ensure available testing for nursing homes is needed, acknowledging Maryland’s efforts to do the same. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan last week ordered expedited testing for nursing homes through the Maryland State Public Health Laboratory after The Baltimore Sun reported a Carroll County nursing home where cases have proliferated rapidly had not been able to test staff amid the national shortage of tests. Genesis HealthCare had been using private laboratories to conduct testing, Mayer previously said. Testing will now be handled through the state health department. The healthcare provider does not yet have access to state strike teams, Mayer said. While homemade masks don’t meet the facility’s safety standards, Genesis HealthCare is looking for donations from local doctors and dentists who have been forced to close due to COVID-19. The facility needs new-in-box surgical masks, isolation gowns and safety or laboratory goggles. Supplies can be dropped off at the entrance to Loch Raven Center at 8720 Emge Road.

Sheetz stores in Harford, Carroll offering free kids meals during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Sheetz, a Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain with several stores in Maryland, announced it’ll offer free meals to children in need for the next two weeks as families continue to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Beginning Thursday, April 2, participating stores, including ones in Harford and Carroll counties, will begin offering free “Kidz Meal Bagz” consisting of a turkey sandwich, chips and a drink. Families can ask an employee at the register for up to one meal bag per child. The meals will be available daily while supplies last. “The spread of COVID-19 and subsequent school closures has left many children across the communities we serve without a reliable food source,” said Travis Sheetz, President & COO of Sheetz, Inc., in a prepared release. “It is our hope Sheetz’s Kidz Meal Bagz program will make a small difference and provide nourishment to those in need during these uncertain times.” Central Maryland stores offering the meal bags include the Sheetz at 601 Pulaski Highway in Joppa and at 40 Antrim Blvd. in Taneytown. A full list of participating locations can be found at: www.sheetz.com/news/kidzmeals.

Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services striving to continue worldwide impact during coronavirus pandemic
.W
As the impact of the coronavirus continues to grow in Maryland and the United States, Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services is striving to ensure that other countries are as prepared as possible for what the virus brings their way. Amid the pandemic, CRS, a nonprofit that serves as the overseas relief and development arm of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, has worked to not only keep its employees spread throughout the world safe, but support those in need, the organization’s president and CEO said. “People think we should close and go inward and have supply chains and assist ... ‘our people,’” Sean Callahan said. “We as an international agency see ‘our people’ as globally." Worldwide, Catholic Relief representatives have educated numerous communities on the virus, provided cleaning supplies and installed handwashing stations while teaching proper techniques. The organization is working to protect staff members abroad, Callahan said, especially given that many of them are in countries with inadequate health systems. “We want to model the best behaviors, and so we’ve been limiting movement, working more virtually,” Callahan said. “But we need to have access for continuity of operations to continue some of the lifesaving work that we do regularly.” In Afghanistan, CRS has distributed more than 60,000 bars of soap. In Kenya, the relief group has trained 3,500 health care workers in the nation’s capital on how to fight the virus. In Sierra Leone, it has prepared take-home meals for the families of 50,000 students. Those virus-fighting efforts come on top of the regular work the organization would be performing at this time of year. As a result, though, CRS has “adjusted all of our programming that’s currently going on,” Callahan said. In places where the organization distributes a weekly supply of food to families, Catholic Relief is increasing the size of the supply to last a month to minimize physical contact and encourage social distancing. CRS also has reduced any programs that require large gatherings, and if a gathering occurs, it’s outdoors to allow participants to space out. Staff members also continue to supply needed medication, particularly for those undergoing antiretroviral therapy as part of HIV or AIDS treatment. “We want to make sure that people who may have compromised situations, whether it’s nutritional issues or malaria and things like that, that they get their appropriate treatment that they’ve been getting all along,” Callahan said. Malaria in particular poses a challenge. The World Health Organization issued a report last week noting that if countries prone to the disease don’t continue to get the support they need during the pandemic, 20 years of medical progress fighting malaria could be lost. “Already, health systems and health facilities are overloaded with patients, but that is going to be amplified in the high malaria transmission season, which a lot of Africa, West Africa is coming into,” said Suzanne Van Hulle, the global malaria adviser for CRS. “It will not only have a huge negative impact on the battle to combat COVID-19, but it’s also going to have a huge negative effect on kids and pregnant women who are very vulnerable to death due to malaria. ... “If we don’t do anything, we’ll have way more deaths due to malaria than we would due to COVID-19.” As result, Catholic Relief has changed its practices for distributing much needed goods such as malaria drugs and insecticide-treated mosquito nets, Van Hulle said. It’s also using digital tools to perform more remote training, she said. Van Hulle is working as part of CRS’s coronavirus response team and did the same during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. She said that for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three countries Ebola hit hardest, the ongoing pandemic is similar. “I know that right from the beginning, even before Sierra Leone had its first confirmed case, they were already starting to stop shaking hands and adapt [to the] kind of the old behaviors that they had during the Ebola outbreak,” Van Hulle said. “They knew what potential activities would prevent them from [getting] the virus, so for them, this was a little bit like muscle memory. “But for the rest of the world, this is hugely different.” CRS is trying to help as many countries as it can during this uncertain time, making sure that nations cannot only protect themselves against the coronavirus, but also whatever other challenges they could face in the coming months. “We are a global community,” Callahan said. “We need to make sure that even the least among us has that assistance.”

Chianti Jackson Harpool, a Baltimore therapist with an ‘angelic’ spirit, dies of coronavirus
.W
Though described as soft-spoken by many, nobody was a stranger to Chianti Jackson Harpool, from former NAACP president Kweisi Mfume to Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby to the average Madison Park resident. Mrs. Harpool, a longtime social worker, executive assistant in the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office and chocolatier, died April 8 after suffering complications from the new coronavirus. She was 51. “She was a generous and thoughtful person,” said Adrian Harpool, her husband and owner of a public relations and marketing firm. “She wasn’t moved by people’s positions. She knew a lot of people who were very significant in our eyes to the community but they weren’t any more important to her than [anyone else.]” Mrs. Harpool, daughter of Dennis Jackson Sr., a truck driver for a produce company, and Melissa Jackson, a retired administrator at UMBC, was born Aug. 21, 1968, in Howard Park. Mrs. Harpool, affectionately called “Tiki” by friends and family, was a 1986 graduate of the Institute of Notre Dame and 1990 graduate of then-Towson State University, where she received a Bachelor of Science degree in social work. She later received an advanced degree in psychology from Bowie State University. She worked as a drug counselor at the Johns Hopkins Broadway Center for Addiction and Baltimore Behavioral Health, and as a social worker for Health Care for the Homeless. In 2015, Mrs. Harpool left social work to attend a six-month program at the International Culinary Center in New York. She returned home and launched a home-based chocolate-making business, Chianti’s Chocolates. The chocolate-making business shared roots with her father, who owned a confectionery business based in Cherry Hill, Westport and Brooklyn. In 2007, she offered Mr. Harpool a seat next to her for a Sunday service at City Temple of Baltimore Baptist Church. The two later agreed to go to brunch and went on car rides in the country — he described her as a “car fanatic” and lover of Porsches and Mustangs. They began dating, and in 2008 the two married. Mrs. Harpool spent time volunteering for Ms. Mosby’s campaign for city state’s attorney. Following Ms. Mosby’s election in 2014, she invited Mrs. Harpool to join her office as an executive assistant. Ms. Mosby remembered Mrs. Harpool as “a great mother, a wonderful wife and a really good friend." "She was a really great listener, and she just had a gentle spirit about her. ... Her spirit was somewhat angelic.” Mrs. Harpool left the state’s attorney’s office in 2018 to join her husband’s business. An “ardent” Prince fan, Mrs. Harpool was often involved with the fashion community, particularly in the Station North Arts District, where she modeled in events, assisted with projects and donated clothes to people and women’s shelters. “She was a beautiful spirit," said Caprece Jackson-Garrett, who worked with Mrs. Harpool on several fashion-centric projects. “There was a softness about her and she was elegant. ... When you were in her presence, it was very magical. [She] made Baltimore a great place to be in. “For her to be gone, it’s like the birds stopped singing for a second.” The family will hold a small private service on April 20 and hold a celebration of life on Mrs. Harpool’s birthday. In addition to her husband and parents, Mrs. Harpool is survived by a son, Brian Taltoan II; a brother, Dennis Jackson Jr.; a stepson, Ian Harpool; a stepdaughter, Laura Harpool; and four nephews, all of Baltimore. A previous marriage ended in divorce.

Sykesville native returns home after study abroad program in Italy canceled over coronavirus concerns
.W
This was supposed to be midterms week for Abby Enslow. But as the COVID-19 coronavirus spread in Italy, where she was studying abroad in Reggio Emilia, her program chose to shut down. Less than 24 hours after getting notice, she was on a plane home to Sykesville. The program’s decision was made after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised the level of its travel notice for Italy, telling U.S. travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country because of widespread community transmission of the new coronavirus, which causes the disease called COVID-19. An alumna of Century High School, Enslow is a junior majoring in communication studies at University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Her study abroad program was run by a third party, the University Studies Abroad Consortium. Enslow’s program gave her a few days to leave, but her parents were eager to have her home as soon as possible, she said in an interview. She bought plane tickets a few hours after the announcement and left Italy on March 1. Flying out of the Bologna airport, there were some workers in hazmat suits who were taking travelers’ temperatures, she said. Fever is one of the symptoms of infection, alongside coughing and difficulty breathing. The airport gave her information about the coronavirus and preventative measures for when she returned home, she said. She has been monitoring her temperature and it has remained normal. She had a stopover in London before landing at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, and “Honestly, as soon as I got to the London airport, it was like the coronavirus wasn’t even a thing. Nobody was wearing masks anymore,” she said. From London, she flew to BWI, where she didn’t know what to expect after telling customs agents she came from Italy. Customs officials did not choose to place her under quarantine. She is taking necessary precautions now that she is back home. In at least one case, an ill patient was taken off a Southwest Airlines flight at BWI. That person was medically evaluated on Jan. 25 and did not meet the federal criteria for coronavirus testing at that time. The week before Enslow left northern Italy, she said, schools and churches were closed, and even the Vatican was affected. Her classes met online and not in person. But she said her program advisors thought that students would be back to in-person classes the next week. When her program asked students to evacuate, it was a surprise, she said. She didn’t get a chance to say goodbye in person to her teachers or many of those she met while abroad. But she is proud of how her program and university are handling the situation, she said. She hopes to start online classes soon to finish out her spring semester. Back home, she said, in some ways the public atmosphere feels more fearful than it was in Italy. “It’s hard to gauge the severity of the situation when you’re in it. And it is, of course, impacting Italy more severely than it is impacting America, and Maryland more so.” She said that the first day after the CDC declared Italy a level 2 travel advisory, grocery store shelves were emptied and many people began wearing masks. But after a little bit, “It was totally normal, everyday life after the first surge of fear. The grocery stores were restocked again, people weren't really wearing masks out on a casual stroll through the city and you really couldn't tell that there was anything going on necessarily. Of course it dominated our conversations. But outside of that, you couldn't really tell anything was going on.” State health officials confirmed Maryland’s first three cases of the disease Thursday evening. Gov. Larry Hogan said the patients, all in Montgomery County, were in “good condition.” McDaniel College and Carroll Community College do not have students traveling abroad in areas for which CDC has issued COVID-19 travel notices, but spokespeople say they continue to monitor developing information. McDaniel spokeswoman Cheryl Knauer said the college is in touch with students studying abroad in Budapest, Hungary, through the McDaniel Europe program, as well as others who are studying abroad elsewhere this semester. They had not announced the suspension of any study abroad programs or recall of any students currently abroad. The college is creating a section of its website dedicated to coronavirus information, she said. Carroll Community College spokeswoman Trish Carroll said the college does not currently have any students in programs abroad. Carroll Community was still planning to move forward with a trip to Germany and Austria scheduled in late May, and “We are in close contact with both the health department and the travel vendor who is handling the trip itinerary,” Carroll said in an email. The college plans to “continue to carefully and proactively monitor the evolving Novel Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 health situation, and we will take the appropriate actions recommended by the State and Carroll County Health Departments if and when the need arises,” she added. The CDC recommends that travelers do the following to reduce their risk of infection or spread: avoid contact with sick people and wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60% to 95% alcohol; stay home and monitor their health during travel and for 14 days after returning to the U.S.; and seek medical advice if feeling sick with a fever or cough, or difficulty breathing. Call ahead before going to a doctor’s office or emergency room. Marylanders can go to health.maryland.gov/coronavirus for the most up-to-date information, or dial 211 to talk to experts about any questions or concerns.

Meal distribution for Carroll County kids expands to include dinner during coronavirus-related closure
.W
A Carroll County Public Schools program to provide meals for children and teens while schools are closed to limit the spread of the coronavirus has expanded to include dinner. The Emergency Meal Distribution program was announced Friday, and is available to all 18 and younger, regardless of whether they are enrolled in CCPS. The program operates Monday through Friday, and children must be present to receive the meals. “Acceptance and participation requirements for the program and all activities are the same for all regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. There will be no discrimination in the course of the meal service,” the school system wrote in a news release Friday. Carroll County schools are closed until March 30 under an executive order from Gov. Larry Hogan in hopes to slow the spread of the coronavirus also known by the disease it causes, COVID-19. Schools will re-evaluate whether a longer closure is necessary. Most private schools followed suit in closing as well. Breakfast, lunch and dinner will be available to children at 138 sites around Maryland as of Monday, Hogan announced. State Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon has applied for a federal waiver for the program. All pickup sites throughout Maryland can be found at mdsummermeals.org. The sites for meal pickup in Carroll County are: Manchester: Immanuel Lutheran Church parking lot (immediately across from Manchester Elementary School), 10 a.m. to noon, 3184 Church St.  South Carroll area: South Carroll High School parking lot, 10 a.m. to noon, 1300 W. Old Liberty Road  Taneytown: Taneytown Elementary School parking lot, 10 a.m. to noon, 100 Kings Drive  Westminster: Robert Moton Elementary School parking lot, 10 a.m. to noon, 1413 Washington Road; William Winchester Elementary School parking lot, 10 a.m. to noon, 70 Monroe St.; Bishop’s Garth Park at Center and Bishop streets, noon to 12:30 p.m.; Dutterer Family Park, Dutterer Way and Winters Street, 1-1:30 p.m. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Sprinkle: Save the criticism until the coronavirus crisis has passed
.W
Years ago, while I was browsing through the various offerings of a Baltimore bookstore, I came across a collection of poetry. Perhaps one might say the poems were more akin to versification than literary excellence. Nevertheless, one of the poems, in particular, had that gravitas that lingers in the mind and resurfaces from time to time as events converge. It was simple in its structure and not what one might call erudite. It merely spoke its quiet truth to anyone willing to listen. The poem begins: “A little seed lay on the ground, and soon began to sprout.” As the poem progresses, the seed looks around the garden and begins to muse on what it will become. A lily? A rose? A violet? A Canterbury bell? The little seed evaluates each flower, and it finds fault with all of them — too cold, too old, too blue. Then we learn the sad truth: “And so it criticized each flower, this supercilious seed, until it woke one summer morn, and found itself — a weed.” The poem is titled, “The Critic;” the poet is unknown. “The Critic” is a commentary on those who have a myopic disposition to criticize, those who fail to find the slightest merit in the accomplishment of others. They tout supposed shortcomings, loudly and obsessively, and attack with biting criticism, but they never find the conviction to offer a word of praise for a job well done. Had the little seed known what it was destined to become, it may have been more charitable in its judgment of the flowers that populated the garden. Instead, it became an incessant critic, and in the process, nothing more than “sounding brass” or a “tinkling cymbal.” It was a weed, and left unchallenged by others with a divergent point of view, it would eventually contaminate the whole garden. Under ordinary circumstances, we might attribute such wrangling to political posturing, a “we-versus-they” environment in which any positive statement about an opponent could be considered political weakness. These, however, are not ordinary times, and Americans are in no mood for supercilious critics. We are not impressed by the incessant whining and criticism of Congressional opportunists who celebrate the content of their ice cream freezers while Americans are standing in food lines, or claim an environmental victory when the global price of oil collapses. America is fighting for its survival. As of this writing, 43,000 Americans are dead, and another 800,000 Americans have confirmed cases of COVID-19, many of whom are teetering between life and death. Economists estimate the unemployment rate is now in the 15-20% range. Americans need time to regain their equilibrium; they need time to mourn their losses and bury their dead. One would think these facts alone would create a solid bond of cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. At a time when the country is under attack by a microscopic savage; at a time when our leaders are working around the clock to minimize destruction to the homeland; at a time when Americans are suffering personal losses and yet continue to sacrifice for the benefit of all — it’s time to save the criticism until the crisis has passed. But that expectation lies only in the land of unicorns. Never does the mantra change. “Never let a crisis go to waste.” Never stop spreading the seeds of criticism. One of my friends had a marvelous idea for a political cartoon that aptly captures the current climate of criticism. Unfortunately, that friend was not gifted with the ability to draw, so she asked me to describe it for you. We have an elephant. Let’s just call him “DJ.” Beside him is a pallet of bricks, each labeled “24k.” Finally, we have a cluster of screeching donkeys — the queen jenny and a few lesser jacks and jennies. “You get an F,” the queen shrieks. And the rest of the pompous little donkeys, with all of their wisdom on full display, chime in: “Why aren’t they ‘25k’?” M.K. Sprinkle writes from Hampstead. Her column appears every other Saturday.

Baltimore officials condemn continuing gun violence as city grapples with coronavirus
.W
A day after eight people were shot in Baltimore, including seven in a single incident, top officials condemned the continuing gun violence, saying it further strains resources at a time when the coronavirus is upending daily life. Tuesday’s mass shooting took place around 6:30 p.m. when a gunman with a semi-automatic assault rifle opened fire on a group of people congregated on a street corner in West Baltimore’s Madison Park neighborhood. An officer on patrol nearby opened fire on the suspect, police said. Investigators were continuing to determine whether he struck any of the people who were injured, though they do not believe the suspect was among the victims taken to hospitals. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said the violence — which has spiked recently after a lull to start the month — was unacceptable. “We can not clog up our hospitals or their beds with people who are being shot senselessly because we’re going to need those beds for people who might be infected with the coronavirus,” Young said. “Put down the guns.” City Council President Brandon Scott, meanwhile, said city officials need to be working just as hard to end gun violence in Baltimore as they are working to stop the spread of the virus. Sixty-one people have been killed in Baltimore so far this year, with another 111 people shot and wounded. Those numbers are on par with this time last year, when the city set a per capita record for homicides. The victims in Tuesday evening’s shooting were listed as a 37-year-old woman, and six males: a 17-year-old, three 20-year-olds, a 23-year-old and a 24-year-old. All of the victims’ injuries were considered non-life-threatening. In addition to the mass shooting, police said a 20-year-old man was shot around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday in Northwest Baltimore. Anthony Lewis was shot and killed in the 4900 block of Reisterstown Road. Outside the Pedestal Gardens Apartments in Madison Park Wednesday morning, there were little signs of the shooting the night before. One strand of yellow police tape remained at Madison Avenue. Inside the apartment complex, a group of security guards with bullet proof vests chatted while several residents passed by. Kia Grant and her 3-year-old daughter Rylee were leaving their apartment to pick up classwork for her daughters. Grant said she was home when the shooting happened Tuesday night but didn’t hear any shots because she said the family was listening to music. Grant learned of the incident when family called concerned after seeing news reports of the shooting just outside her apartment building. Outside, she said she saw a number of police officers at the scene. Grant said she’s never experienced violence so close to home, but she shrugged it off. “Stuff happens everywhere,” she said of the violence — and of the coronavirus that has kept her and her daughters inside. “The corona[virus] is everywhere now. Regardless of where you’re at, you’ve got to make the best of it.” Police said they did not have a detailed description of the shooting suspect. “People are extremely concerned about this,” said Baltimore City Councilman Eric T. Costello, who represents the neighborhood and hss heard from worried residents. He also said the violence is particularly concerning as officials grapple with the spreading coronavirus. “The level of violence is unacceptable and people need to put down their guns and stop jeopardizing and overwhelming our healthcare system,” Costello said. After a relatively quiet start to the month of March, gun violence has picked up in the city, including a spate of daytime shootings. Two people were killed Monday afternoon in separate incidents — Sergio Jones, 28, was fatally shot in Greektown, while 30-year-old Rodricus Milligan was killed in the Govans area of North Baltimore. And on Sunday afternoon, 20-year-old Montrell Johnson was gunned down in the Brooklyn Homes area. Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said Tuesday evening’s shooting was brazen, but made a point of praising the bravery of the officer who was on patrol alone and fired back. The officer has not been identified. Ken Thompson, who heads the monitoring team that is overseeing the police department’s implementation of the consent decree reforms, said he’s waiting for additional details about the shooting. Thompson said he hasn’t yet seen the incident report or any body-worn camera footage. “Last night, it was so much stuff going on,” Thompson said, but he believes the commissioner may brief the monitoring team Thursday. Members of the team have gone out to every shooting involving a police officer. Despite the ongoing concerns of the coronavirus, he said much of the work continues. “It’s unfortunate, he said, "but this thing has hit everybody and we just have to adapt to it.”

Confirmed coronavirus cases rises to 19 in Carroll County, 16 active
.W
In just over two weeks, the number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in Carroll County has gone from 1 to 19, 16 of which are active, according to the county health department. As of Saturday morning, March 28, there were 19 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, said Maggie Kunz, spokesperson for the Carroll County Health Department. That’s five more than on Friday, March 27, when Kunz said Carroll had 14 cases, 11 active. Six of the confirmed cases are people in their 20s, two in their 30s, six in their 40s, two in their 50s, and two in their 60s, Kunz said. Five are men and 13 are women, she said. One person’s age and gender have yet to be confirmed, according to Kunz. The new cases announced March 28 are not related to the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, Kunz said. On March 27, the health department announced two women in their 50s at the nursing home have contracted COVID-19 and more than 60 residents are awaiting test results. Some staff have also been tested. Also on March 27, the health department announced that the first three people found to have COVID-19 in Carroll County were deemed recovered. The first case was announced March 13, the second March 17, and the third March 19. Those individuals have recovered from the disease, Kunz said, according to Centers for Disease Control guidelines. There were 992 confirmed cases in Maryland as of 10 a.m. March 28, according to the Maryland Department of Health website. Anyone feeling ill should contact their health care professional. Carroll County Health Department is operating a COVID-19 hotline, available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week, at 410-876-4848. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. Those with emergencies should continue to call 911.

Maryland lawmakers push forward with sweeping education bills; mull early close due to coronavirus spread
.W
Maryland lawmakers on Saturday pushed forward with three sweeping education bills as they considered ending the 441st legislative session early due to the spread of the coronavirus. Democrats who control the state legislature said they were moving ahead quickly in hopes of passing a plethora of legislation, including three major school funding proposals: A $4 billion annual plan to overhaul the state’s public schools; a $2.2 billion school construction funding boost, and a $580 million increase to historically black colleges and universities. But Republicans called on them to halt those plans and merely pass the state budget before the virus’ effects were widespread. As of Saturday, Maryland had more than two dozen known cases of COVID-19 ― a fast-spreading illness that has a death rate much higher than the flu. Health experts have encouraged the public to avoid large gatherings to slow the disease’s spread. Maryland has a 188-member legislature, a number that doesn’t count legislative staff. “I’m not sure we should be moving forward with the economic uncertainty,” said state Sen. Justin Ready, a Carroll County Republican. Sen. Paul Pinsky, a Prince George’s County Democrat, argued the legislation was badly needed to improve public education. By doing that, Pinsky said, it would help Maryland’s finances by providing a skilled workforce ready to fill jobs in a changing economy. “The charge was to make our schools world-class,” Pinsky said. “The goal here to help the state’s economy and provide employees ... to fill those positions. I don’t believe there is any county that is meeting that world-class standard.” Legislative leadership called in lawmakers to work all weekend to expedite the session, should it need to end before the scheduled last day of April 6. Among the notable absences was Senate President Emeritus Thomas V. Mike Miller, who has been battling cancer. Health experts say older people and those with underlying health conditions should avoid crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic. Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said the legislature would consider whether to stay in session once the budget passes. The Senate has already passed a $47.9 billion spending plan, which is awaiting action in the House of Delegates. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has urged lawmakers to give the budget final approval by Tuesday, in the event the General Assembly needs to adjourn early. “Once the budget passes, we’re going to evaluate where things stand," Ferguson said. Passing the budget is the only action that lawmakers are required to complete during the session under the Maryland Constitution. Ferguson also said he believes appointing Hogan’s nominees to various posts in state government is a “must do” before the legislature adjourns. Ferguson and House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones have taken a number of steps to try to limit the number of people at the State House, including banning the public, lobbyists and advocates from the complex unless they have an appointment. Senate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings, a Harford County Republican, said he was concerned the legislature was violating the Open Meetings Act by locking the public out of committee sessions. “There’s a lack of transparency when we’re voting,” Jennings said. House members did not discuss the access restrictions or the potential of an early adjournment during their session. But Del. Talmadge Branch, a Baltimore Democrat who is the majority whip, reminded delegates to “remain safe and germ free.” “Be respectful of everyone’s space and make sure you’re careful how you touch others,” he said. Both chambers meet for several hours Saturday afternoon, considering hundreds of bills. The Senate gave preliminary approval to the recommendations of the so-called Kirwan Commission, which proposed the $4 billion-per-year overhaul of Maryland’s public schools ― boosting teacher pay, expanding vocational training, and funding additional services for children in the poorest communities. The legislation, backed by Democrats who control the legislature, has already passed the House with a party-line vote of 96-41. In a significant move, the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment from Sen. Nancy King, a Montgomery County Democrat, that would limit the Kirwan reforms in the event of a substantial economic downturn. In introducing the amendment, King cited concerns over the coronavirus’ impact on the economy. Under the amendment, if state revenues drop by 7.5% in a given year, the Kirwan plans would be put on hold and increases to education spending would be limited to the rate of inflation. That bill now needs one more vote to pass the Senate. The House, which previously approved the Kirwan bill, had rejected a similar amendment. So, the Senate’s move set up a potential conflict between the chambers. Both chambers must pass the same versions of the bill in order for the legislation to be successful. The Senate gave preliminary approval the Built to Learn Act, a plan to boost funding of school construction projects across the state by $2.2 billion. That bill, which the House has already passed, has bipartisan support. The $2.2 billion would be distributed to counties over five years from bonds issued by the Maryland Stadium Authority. The bonds would be paid back over 30 years using $125 million a year in casino revenues set aside in a so-called “education lockbox.” The Senate also quickly gave preliminary approval to a third education funding bill: A plan from Jones to require the governor to spend $580 million over the next 10 years at the state’s four historically black colleges and universities on initiatives including creating academic programs, expanding scholarships and marketing the schools to potential students. That bill passed the House by a 129-2 vote. The House, meanwhile, gave its approval to measures that would give survivors of child sexual abuse more time to sue, remove the governor from parole decisions for inmates serving life sentences, and add ethnic hairstyles and natural hair texture to the definition of “race” in Maryland’s anti-discrimination law. The Senate previously approved a version of the hairstyle bill, which has been dubbed the “Crown Act.” Both chambers also pushed forward with emergency legislation to reduce barriers to healthcare access amid the spread of coronavirus. The bill would cut costs of screening tests, improve access to telehealth services, prohibit price gouging and ensure those under quarantine cannot lose their jobs. Lawmakers voted Saturday to add an amendment that make it easier to get temporary unemployment benefits for those laid off or have to leave their jobs during the crisis. Sen. Brian Feldman, a Montgomery County Democrat, said the legislation shows why the Assembly needs to stay in session for as long as possible. “We are essential personnel and we need to be here,” Feldman said. Both chambers also took up tax bills to try to raise more money to pay for the Kirwan Commission recommendations. The House approved a bill that would apply the state’s sales tax to lobbying, public relations and telemarketing services; and the Senate gave initial approval to taxes on digital advertising, digital downloads and tobacco. The bills are part of a package to raise around $700 million to help pay for the reforms to public schools.

Baltimore private school sends three students home who may have had 'indirect contact’ with coronavirus patient
.W
A private all-girls Jewish school in Baltimore sent three students home early Wednesday because they may have come in contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus. In an email sent to parents, Bnos Yisroel school leaders said the three girls had “possible indirect contact” with a person who tested positive for coronavirus in New York. The school, at 6300 Park Heights Ave, said it has contacted the Baltimore City and Maryland health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the local rabbi. Baltimore Rabbi Ariel Sadwin said the contact traced back to a Westchester County, New York man who has COVID-19. A woman who drove the infected man in a car tested positive. The girls had been at a gathering in New York where the woman had been. The health agencies advised the school to send the girls home from the prekindergarten through 12th grade school in the Cross Country neighborhood. Officials said they are in the process of disinfecting the school as a “precautionary” measure. School officials said they are following the health agencies’ recommended guidelines and that the girls will not be returning to school until they are cleared by a health department. Until then, they will be closely monitored. The school said it will remain open and advised parents to keep taking precautions such as proper hand-washing and disinfecting every night. Children who are sick with a fever, cough or other cold symptoms should stay home, the school said. “As this situation is evolving, we will notify you immediately if anything changes,” the school wrote in the email. Maryland health officials on Thursday night confirmed the state’s first three cases of coronavirus, the respiratory disease that has sickened about 100,000 across the globe and killed more than 3,000. Baltimore Sun reporter Liz Bowie contributed to this article.

Normally passive conservatives are protesting loudly over coronavirus shutdowns | COMMENTARY
.W
Conservatives are mostly a passive lot, expressing their frustrations and anger over ideas they oppose by listening to or watching Fox News, talk radio, or attending Trump rallies when that was possible. The duration of the COVID-19 lockdown and its associated unemployment "pandemic" are changing that. Recent arbitrary executive orders by some governors have driven many who have never before demonstrated for or against anything into the streets of state capitals, with more likely to come. They want their jobs and country back. President Trump is helping them out with his rallying cry to "liberate" Michigan, Virginia and Minnesota. These states are led by Democratic governors, whose party members in Congress appear to me to view the virus as a political opportunity to damage President Trump's re-election prospects. At least some Republican governors are heeding the president’s call to “open up.” Last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida announced the reopening of some beaches and parks with restrictions. In Texas, as the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram reported, Gov. Greg Abbott "Outlined a careful, phased-in effort to allow businesses to open." The governor also named advisory panels to suggest next steps. Such panels are becoming the preferred strategy. If a policy fails, politicians can spread the failure and responsibility around, while taking credit for any success. Governor Abbott also promised he will be guided by medical data. One hopes that doesn’t include computer models, which, according to National Review, are proving unreliable in forecasting the number of deaths and new virus cases. Restaurants should be allowed to reopen while practicing social distancing and requiring staff to wear masks and gloves. In warmer climates, outdoor tables and chairs could help bring traffic back to pre-pandemic numbers. Restaurant employees are often the most economically vulnerable because many rely heavily on tips. Whatever money they might receive if restaurant owners applied for government loans and grants is not likely to make up the difference. That there has been an overreaction to this virus, in my opinion, is hard to dispute. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, who has exchanged compliments with President Trump for the federal assistance given to his state, accused the president of "fomenting domestic rebellion" with his liberation calls. He added that the president is encouraging "illegal and dangerous acts." I don't think so. Last week, Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order, which, according to Bridge, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization, permits “kayaking, boating, sailing or canoeing, but not in a motorized pontoon boat or anything that would require a trip to the gas station.” People can “mow their own lawn, but not hire someone to do it.” Michiganders can “travel to care for an elderly relative, but not visit friends or go to second homes.” They can also “go for a walk, but not go golfing.” Liquor and lottery ticket sales were not banned by the governor, who is under consideration by Joe Biden as a possible running mate. With such silly and arbitrary dictates, is it any wonder more people are taking to the streets? Look for Cal Thomas’ new book “America’s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires and Superpowers and the Future of the United States” (HarperCollins/Zondervan).

Howard County to open drive-thru site for physician-approved coronavirus testing
.W
Beginning Tuesday, Howard County will offer drive-thru coronavirus testing to those recommended by a physician at the Columbia emissions testing center. On Friday, Gov. Larry Hogan announced the additional testing site along with a site at the White Oak emissions testing center in Montgomery County. Earlier this week, the state opened three testing sites, one each in Bel Air, Glen Burnie and Waldorf. The Howard County Health Department and Maryland Department of Health will offer testing at these sites for residents displaying symptoms who have both a referral from their health care provider and a test appointment. Only after getting a referral will patients be given directions on how to make an appointment at a test site. “To effectively track the spread of COVID-19, we must have more testing and the new drive-thru testing at the Columbia VEIP station is a step in the right direction,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said in a statement. “Ultimately there is a shortage of testing across the country, and we’re working with our state and federal partners to remedy that as quickly as possible.” The site will be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays and, like at sites across the country, residents will stay in their vehicles with the windows up until they receive a test. The testing site is located at 6340 Woodside Court, #1071, in Columbia.

Maryland bars and restaurants shuttered by coronavirus can now deliver beer and wine
.W
Like restaurants across Maryland, The Bluebird began offering a carryout menu this week in an effort to recoup some of the losses from the coronavirus pandemic. Among the offerings at the Hampden pub: Scotch eggs, kale salads and bottled cocktails like their signature Old Fashioned, made with Old Grandad whiskey and large enough to serve ten people. In the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, a small silver lining for bars and restaurants: The executive order from Maryland Governor Larry Hogan banning on-premise drinking and dining at area establishments also allows them to offer drinks for carryout and delivery, says Tom Akras, deputy executive secretary of the liquor license board. The change may be a small help to the hospitality industry that’s been gut-punched by coronavirus and the need for broad social distancing measures. In Baltimore County, officials havestarted fast-tracking requests from liquor stores, restaurants and bars to be allowed to deliver to county residents. These businesses were already allowed to deliver alcohol, but typically the process requires a hearing, said Mike Mohler, chief administrator of the county liquor board. That requirement has been waived. Businesses that have been penalized for serving minors within the past three years will not be approved for delivery, he said. “We’re doing this primarily by email,” Mohler said. “As long as the record’s clean, we’ll approve it.” The goal is to help local businesses during a time of economic uncertainty. “Since they’re closed, but delivery is an option for them … we see a number of establishments trying to change their business model to keep their cash flow going and to keep people working,” Mohler said. Several Baltimore restaurant managers contacted by The Baltimore Sun were unaware that the law might allow them to deliver alcohol. “This is the first I’ve heard of it,” said Aaron Isle, general manager at Cosima. The restaurant along the Jones Falls near Hampden plans to offer takeout and delivery, with some servers now driving vehicles. “I think we would most certainly take advantage of it.” On Monday, officials with Baltimore’s liquor license board teamed up with officers from the police department to visit local establishments and ensure that they were selling liquor for carryout only, Akras said. It’s a strange reversal for the department, usually charged with making sure that licensees aren’t operating “sham taverns,” or pretending to have a bar while really only operating as a liquor store. “This thing is changing by the day,” Akras said.

Stella Maris accepts four coronavirus patients in the Baltimore County nursing home’s new COVID-19 unit 
.W
Four patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus are being treated at a new COVID-19 unit at the Stella Maris nursing home that has been authorized by the state to provide overflow capacity for overcrowded hospitals, officials said Wednesday. The nursing home in Timonium did not provide any identifying information for the four new patients. They are Jesuit priests transferred from an infirmary in the Philadelphia area, according to local television news reports. Stella Maris is authorized to add up to 39 additional beds in a pair of COVID-19 units separated from its main nursing home, according to a Certificate of Need issued by the Maryland Health Care Commission last week. The nursing home on Dulaney Valley Road is following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations to halt the spread of the virus, including screening all staff upon entry, prohibiting visitors and nonessential personnel and canceling all group activities at the facility, spokeswoman Rose Kendig said in an emailed statement. Stella Maris, which is sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy, coordinated with the Maryland Department of Health “to ensure appropriate safety protocols for these new admissions," she said. “The safety, health and well-being of our residents and staff is our top priority,” Kendig wrote.

Start of Orioles', MLB season to be further delayed by coronavirus after CDC recommendations
.W
Orioles baseball won’t be back for a long time. Major League Baseball, after days of talks with the players union and further input from experts, announced that, because of the coronavirus pandemic, its season would be further delayed beyond Thursday’s initial announcement of a two-week pushback. As of Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is restricting events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, and MLB announced in a statement Monday afternoon that it will follow those guidelines. The decision ensures that baseball won’t return until at least mid-May. It’s likely the regular season begins even later, with teams possibly needing some form of abbreviated spring training to ramp up for the campaign. “MLB will keep fans updated on decisions regarding plans for the 2020 schedule in the days and weeks ahead,” MLB’s statement read. “The Clubs remain committed to playing as many games as possible when the season begins. We will continue to monitor ongoing events and undertake the precautions and best practices recommended by public health experts, and urge all baseball fans to follow suit. MLB extends its best wishes to all the individuals and communities who have been impacted by the coronavirus.” While certainly a disappointing conclusion for both players and fans, MLB’s announcement comes after a tumultuous week for the country made for an uncertain few days for the sport. Spring training games were happening with full crowds across Florida on Thursday as reports emerged that a suspension of spring training was imminent. For the Orioles, who had a 6:05 p.m. game that night, the lack of official word meant that they loaded up two buses of players and staff to go to the game around 1:30 p.m., only to make four left turns around the block and come back to their spring training facility, where workouts for players not traveling were underway. Eventually, MLB canceled the rest of the spring training games and delayed the start of the regular season, meant to begin March 26, for at least two weeks. The next two days were full of shifting positions as the league and players figured out next steps. On a noon conference call Friday, Orioles executive vice president/general manager Mike Elias said the team and league’s preference was that players stay put at their spring facilities. A few hours later, the league reversed course with a conference call that changed that policy and allowed players to leave. Some teams fully disbanded. Others, like the Orioles, have many players waiting and continuing to prepare on their own near their spring complexes waiting for word on what can happen. The Orioles’ minor leaguers were sent home Saturday, save for those from Venezuela, while major leaguers could likely see the writing on the wall Sunday when an MLB memo outlining how, until further guidance was given, facilities could be open to major leaguers with some staff available, but large-scale workouts would go against the CDC’s social distancing recommendations and thus couldn’t happen. For the Orioles, as well as the rest of the league’s franchises, the implications will be manifold. On a base level, it will be less time where their major league product suffers as they turn their attentions toward the minor league development program they hope will help them contend again. But similarly, it will stall the development of all the prospects they hope will make that happen.

Maryland universities are refunding some student fees due to coronavirus. Here’s what you need to know.
.W
Towson University and University of Maryland, College Park officials are planning to refund and credit students for fees paid for services they can no longer use because the universities have restricted access during the coronavirus pandemic. College Park officials estimate the university will lose about $87 million on the refund of fees and new costs associated with moving to online education, as well as paying employees no longer working on campus. What is the university refunding? College Park will issue credits on a prorated basis for following student fees: parking and shuttle, athletics, recreation services, Stamp Student Union, performing arts and cultural centers, and student facilities. College Park will give prorated refunds or credits to students for their room and board. Towson University will issue prorated refunds for housing, dining and parking charges, as well as the athletics fee and the auxiliary services fee. Towson will refund 51% of fees related to athletics, intramurals, student recreation, student activity, sustainability and student union operations. Are any fees not being refunded? College Park is not making adjustments to library, technology, and health center fees, since these resources are essential to the continuing operations of the campus. When will we find out about our refund? The universities will inform students and families directly about the prorated amounts and how the credits will be issued. What about university employee fees? College Park employees will no longer have their parking taken out of their paychecks. Towson has also discontinued parking fees and is reimbursing the prorated portion of those fees to faculty, staff, and students. What about other universities in the system? No announcements have been made yet.

Harford Mall closing, but restaurants remain open for carryout amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
Harford Mall is closing at 5 p.m. Thursday in accordance with Gov. Larry Hogan’s order for all enclosed shopping malls to shutter to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Three malls in Maryland and multiple anchor and specialty stores across the country, including Macy’s, one of the Harford Mall’s anchors, had already closed on their own. On its website, the Harford Mall noted that certain restaurants with exterior entrances may remain open for curbside pick-up and delivery services. Earlier in the week, Hogan ordered restaurants and bars closed, but allowed for carryout and delivery of food. The Greene Turtle Sports Bar & Grille, Bonefish Grill, Red Robin, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, Qdoba Mexican Grill and Pure Raw Juice were listed on the mall’s website as remaining open. Harford Mall had previously canceled events, including Easter photos, at the mall last week, but had maintained regular mall hours until the governor’s order Thursday.

‘Save us so we can save you’: Maryland doctors, nurses battling coronavirus increasingly desperate for protective supplies 
.W
Dr. Richard Bruno has been using his N95 respirator mask, meant for one-time use, for a week now, hoping to leave more for colleagues who come in more frequent contact with potential coronavirus patients. But with supplies of masks diminishing to worrisome levels across the country, a recipe for sterilizing them recently caught the eye of the Chase Brexton physician: "Bake at 149 degrees for 30 minutes.” Medical professionals are increasingly desperate to find ways to extend the life of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment, or PPE, as demand exceeds supply amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. They have turned to social media to plead for donations from the public, often using the hashtag #GetMePPE, and post photos of themselves disinfecting their worn masks or even wearing trash bags instead of hospital gowns. One Baltimore anesthesiologist posted a picture on Facebook of the mask she was issued, "the one thing that protects me from covid-19. We have been told to write our names on it, protect it and, despite it normally being disposable, keep using it until it get soiled. ... “Save us,” she said, asking for donations of masks, "so we can save you.” She and others expressed concern that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has loosened standards for protective devices, even suggesting that should nothing else be available, they use bandannas or scarves. Hospitals say they’re having trouble replenishing their PPE stock. “It’s become a crisis in the last week,” said Leslie Simmons, executive vice president of LifeBridge Health, which operates Sinai Hospital and other medical centers in the area. Suppliers say the equipment is on back order and can’t give her a date for when they’ll be able to ship, she said. “We are in conservation mode as many hospitals are,” Simmons said. Though “not ideal,” hospitals have resorted to giving staff a single mask or face shield to use throughout a shift unless they become soiled, she said. The demand for PPE is expected to rise even more critically in the coming days, with the World Health Organization warning this week of “a very large acceleration in cases in the U.S." On Thursday, the number of reported cases in the U.S. surpassed that of any other country. Because of the nature of their work, medical professionals are at greater risk of exposure to the virus; they reportedly constitute more than 8% of cases in Italy. Bruno, a family physician at the health clinic in Baltimore’s Mount Vernon neighborhood, said he’s seen several patients possibly infected with the virus, while some co-workers likely have seen more. He said he generally wears a surgical mask, reserving the more protective N95 for when a patient complains of respiratory problems. Some of the tests for the coronavirus offered at Chase Brexton have come up positive. The clinic has been able to keep adequate stock of masks on hand — for now, he said. “The problem is these supply streams aren’t always steady, and if things get worse, we could find ourselves in a predicament," Bruno said. It’s been heartening to see how people have responded to the plight faced by health care providers, he said. His wife, Mary, a fashion designer and seamstress, is among the many who have been making and donating masks — some with a Harry Potter design for staff at the clinic who are fans of the wizard. “They wear them over their masks, more as a morale booster,” he said. Some studies have indicated that depending on the material, handmade masks might not offer sufficient protection. Still, people with sewing machines have been making a variety of masks for grateful health care workers. Additionally, those with 3D printers are helping fabricate plastic face shields with groups such as Open Works, a maker space in Baltimore. Dentists, veterinarians, nail salons and even high school labs have raided their own supply cabinets for unused equipment to donate to hospitals and doctors’ offices. “I’m just sad that this is where we are at, relying on people with sewing machines and 3D printers to protect our front lines," said Heather Harget, a middle school teacher who lives in Parkville and created a Facebook page for Marylanders who want to stitch up masks. "That’s a terrible position to be in. “It’s people stepping up in this terrible time,” she said. “It’s like a modern-day victory garden.” Harget’s masks have pockets in which the wearer can add filtering material for more protection. Acknowledging the shortage, hospitals have issued new guidelines on how to extend the life of masks and other PPE. A spokesman for the University of Maryland Medical System, for example, said that while it currently has “a baseline supply” of protective equipment, it "will need more in the coming weeks and months. “There is a national shortage of PPE and we are impacted by this,” Michael Schwartzberg said. “Currently, our system has embraced assertive PPE conservation strategies, consistent with [CDC] protocols.” Health professionals have scoured stores and made online pitches for masks and other gear. Dr. Rona Stein, a pediatrician in Owings Mills, went to paint and home improvement stores last weekend, and scored some masks and Tyvek coveralls. A Facebook post by her Valley Pediatrics practice netted some donations as well, including from a dental practice. “The generosity of people is so awesome,” she said. Usually it takes months for the practice to go through a box of masks, Stein said, but the threat of coronavirus transmission began depleting the stash. Doctors have been able to limit the number of patients coming to the office by screening them via telemedicine, Still, Stein said, some need to come to the office — preferable to "clogging up” hospital emergency rooms — so safety gear is necessary, especially if they’re showing coronavirus symptoms. “I had a kid who was exposed, plus with ear pain,” she said. “I used one of our very few masks and we met in the parking lot.” She’s awaiting results of the coronavirus test she ordered — and bracing for the rise in infections that many are predicting. There are multiple reasons for the shortage of protective gear, said Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. China, where much of the world’s supply of PPEs is manufactured, shut down some factories while dealing with its own outbreak, although it has ramped up production again, she said. But even as operations resumed, demand soared, Nuzzo said — not just among medical personnel around the world but regular people fearful of contracting the virus. “There was a huge demand for this, not just from the health care industry but the general population," Nuzzo said. "These products are made in only a few places and the demand is far outstripping the supply. "This is a worldwide problem,” she said. “We need to fix it.” The Trump administration has been under pressure to secure more masks, ventilators, testing kits and other necessities by invoking the Defense Production Act, which would allow the federal government to direct private companies to prioritize its orders over others. But President Trump has sent mixed signals, at one point saying states need to buy their own supplies because the federal government isn’t a “shipping clerk,” and, on Tuesday morning, tweeting that masks are on their way without using the act. “The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven’t had to use it because no one has said NO!” Trump tweeted. “Millions of masks coming as back up to States.” States including Maryland already have or are expecting to receive shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies. The stockpile had about 12 million respirator masks — the kind commonly known as N95 — along with 30 million of the less protective surgical masks, officials said earlier this month. But that is a fraction of the 3.5 billion N95 masks that health officials estimate the country will need over the course of a year to deal with a full-blown pandemic. As health professionals await more supplies, concerns are mounting. One Hopkins nurse, who like many other medical professionals requested anonymity to avoid repercussions, said it’s “disconcerting” to be instructed to re-use masks and other protective gear, which goes against past training and protocols. After multiple uses, N95 masks can get creased and misshapen, loosening the tight, protective seal on the wearer’s face, health care workers say. “Under any other circumstances, an employee would have been reprimanded or even let go for that," he said. Another nurse said that while she feels safe now, she and her colleagues are “nervous” about what the future holds as supplies diminish and more patients sickened with COVID-19 need care. “We want to work with these patients," she said, “but we want to work in safe conditions." While Johns Hopkins did not respond to a request for comment, it is among the institutions that have issued guidelines to its staff on how “to safely conserve and reuse” and “help safeguard our supply of PPE,” according to a document obtained by The Baltimore Sun. The guidance is similar to what the CDC has provided to “optimize” equipment "when there is limited supply.” The CDC guidelines even say that as a “last resort" should no masks be available, health care professionals “might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19.” However, the guidance continued, the protective properties of such a mask are unknown, so “caution should be exercised.” Appeals for help have prompted grassroots responses. Dr. Julius Ho, a resident in internal medicine at Johns Hopkins, is part of the Baltimore Health Professionals Mutual Aid Cooperative, which is trying to get donations of supplies from the public and assist in distributing them to hospitals and other health care facilities. Ho said volunteers are reaching out to those who might have masks and other protective gear and have arranged drop-off sites at four area churches. “The nail salons have been very, very cooperative,” he said. “We’ve also made inroads to the creative arts community — painting, woodworking, anyone who might require respirators or gloves." Ho said he hopes those who previously bought masks and other supplies in fear of contracting the virus might realize they could be put to better use by health care workers. Information about the group is available on its Facebook page: facebook.com/bmorehealthmac/ When she heard the news that some health professionals were desperate for supplies, Peg Prentice, who runs the biomedical program at The Catholic High School of Baltimore, realized she had protective gear that students didn’t need with schools closed. “When she asked if we could give away our supplies to help reduce shortages of necessary medical equipment, I was embarrassed that I hadn’t thought of it,” said Barbara D. Nazelrod, the school’s president. Catholic decided to donate its supplies to Mercy Medical Center, where parents of some of its students work and which collaborates with the school’s Nurses’ Club. Harget, the middle school teacher, got interested after she grew alarmed hearing that health care workers didn’t have enough protective gear. She noticed on social media that people were making cloth masks and decided to harness “all this crazy energy” from her school being closed. Now she administers the Facebook group, Million Masks Mayday MD, and said there is at least one other similar group in the state, Sew Masks Central Maryland — Annapolis and Surrounding Counties. Researching patterns that have proliferated online, she decided to make covers that could be worn for additional protection over the N95 masks that medical staff were having to use more than once. It’s not a perfect solution, but the group is getting requests and she hopes its work may tide health care workers over until supplies are replenished. When medical facilities or personnel contact the group seeking masks, members volunteer to fulfill the request and work out delivery arrangements, Harget said. “I feel like I’m doing my part to protect them,” Harget said. Online, doctors are suggesting ways to make what used to be single-use masks safer, including heating them at various temperatures, usually around 150 degrees, for 30 minutes to sterilize them. But don’t try this at home, advised researchers at a Stanford Medicine lab — contaminated masks shouldn’t be brought into a household. That protective gear is in such short supply at a time when it’s needed more than ever is grating, said the doctor who posted on Facebook. “This is what is difficult for all healthcare professionals to accept," she said. “The CDC has loosened its guidelines and accepts use of possibly compromised personal protective equipment so that we can continue to work in the face of a national shortage.” For now, she can only wait for masks that government officials say have been ordered or are on their way.

Carroll County Board of Education special meeting focuses on funding, distance learning amid coronavirus crisis
.W
In a special Board of Education meeting Wednesday morning, board members and Carroll County Public Schools staff touched on some budget questions and discussed the distance learning efforts that started this week as a result of schools being closed due to the coronavirus. At this point, staff who work with operations don’t think CCPS will need to dip into its fund balance to cover costs of this school year. The coronavirus response has caused more spending in some areas and savings in others. Staff may ask the Board to move funds from one area of the budget to another, but they don’t expect to exceed this year’s budget and dip into their rainy day fund, Chief Financial Officer Christopher Hartlove said. The only issue would be if the state Department of Education directs the school districts to extend the school year. For now, CCPS expects there will be some costs associated with getting students caught up on learning, but it is too early for specifics. Answeres to questions about next year’s budget remain less certain as local governments are expecting lower revenues because of the drop in interest rates and other consequences of the coronavirus crisis. Carroll County Commissioner Dennis Frazier, who is the Board of Education’s nonvoting member, said Wednesday there are a lot of unknowns but it is not time to go into “panic mode” yet. This was to be the first of five years that CCPS budgeted under a presumed “smoothing” of funding intended to give the parties more predictability year to year about the county’s contribution to school funding. Frazier said he is not in favor of cutting the county’s funding number down from what they had expressed previously, but was only speaking as one commissioner of five. The meeting Wednesday was conducted via livestream with Board members and staff chiming in via video or phone call. Despite one technical hiccup during the vote to approve the previous meeting’s minutes, Superintendent Steve Lockard said at the end that it seemed to be a viable way to conduct meetings until the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. The format does not however, allow for the public to participate live and give comments. Board President Donna Sivigny said they were still very interested in hearing feedback from the community through emails. Many board members throughout the meeting praised faculty and staff for working to meet “unprecedented” times for the school system. Lockard said he understood many CCPS employees were part of the “massive undertaking” while taking care of their own loved ones and thanked them, too. “I’m so proud to be part of the community that is stepping up," Sivigny said. Chief of Schools Cindy McCabe gave updates on the packets and workbooks that will go to students with total or partial inability to access the internet. Workbooks that follow Common Core curriculum standards for the main subject areas were ordered from a vendor Tuesday and will be shipping out to families. Lockard stressed that the school system is valuing flexibility and would allow families to let the workbooks sit for several days if they wanted to in order to ensure that any possible virus on the surfaces had died. McCabe said curriculum staff have been working on packets for high school students because of the variety of courses available at that level. For families that have requested to borrow a laptop from CCPS, she said she believes there will be enough to meet the need in the community. The school system is working to re-image and clean the devices before they are delivered through a process with the “least amount of human to human contact as we can give our families." “The whole key to this is flexibility,” Lockard said. 'These are unbelievable times so we have to be flexible." Board members Marsha Herbert and Tara Battaglia said they had had some technical difficulties, but overall had been impressed by the level of communication from teachers of their grandchildren and children, respectively who are in CCPS. Herbert also said in the future it would give them tools for snow days. Sivigny commented about how impressive it was that they were able to put in place some chunks of a virtual learning plan that was purposely designed to be a slow roll-out over two to three years, and several agreed. Lockard said however that it was important to recognize that there would be gaps for many students, especially for special education students and English learners. The new system cannot replace classroom instruction, even as they do the best they can to keep learning going. Every household does not have the same resources to support students, he said. Ken Kiler asked if staff could speak to parent fears about students falling behind. McCabe said one thing to remember was that everyone is in the same boat. For curriculum staff in CCPS, the first “big lift” was moving curriculum online and to paper formats. The next one will be figuring out how to catch students up on particular content they need once they know how long the closures will last. Sivigny asked if staff could give examples of what an ideal day will look like for students with various types of access. McCabe said they are staying “away from giving parents a formula because we understand that parents are in very different situations at home.” For one example parents may be working from home and unable to let a student use a computer while a parent is working. The goal is to be flexible about what a student’s work week can look like, whether that is working a little every day or loading work on certain days of the week. Teachers have established office hours during set parts of the days. Chief of Operations Jonathan O’Neal gave an update that CCPS is continuing to manage accounts and pay bills, and the the most recent payroll went through without issue. CCPS continues to employ all hourly employees in their employee bargaining groups, but not some others, such as day-to-day substitute teachers. He recognized many areas of staff, such as Supervisor of School Security and Emergency Management Duane Williams who is the main point of contact for emergency preparedness as CCPS tries to be “the best possible partners we can be because this is obviously much bigger than a Carroll County Public Schools Issue” and Supervisor of Health Services Filipa Gomes, who is in contact with the health department. Food Services has been “a glowing success really from the first second,” providing meals for an average of 1,000 children a day, three meals a day under the direction of Karen Sarno and her team. They hope to expand the program to more sites if possible. And the technology Help Desk who are not only serving employees now but parents and teachers. In closing, Lockard said, “We miss our kids, we miss our teachers, we miss opening our doors everyday and being that hub in our community." Links to the video recording of the meeting and the FAQ document for distance learning are available through carrollk12.org. The next Board of Education meeting will be livestreamed Wednesday, April 8 at 5 p.m.

Baltimore employees on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic will get stipend
.W
Baltimore will provide some employees at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic with a $200 biweekly stipend, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced Wednesday. “It is critical that we provide any relief we can to our front line employees to ease burdens at home while they continue to go to work on behalf of the city and its residents,” Young said in a statement. The stipend will go into effect Monday, and will show up on employees’ first scheduled payroll checks. Firefighters, EMTs and police officers will each receive $200, while other employees deemed “mission critical” will get an additional $100 biweekly. Young, a Democrat, last week put the city under a state of emergency. Since then, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the city has increased tenfold.

When will the coronavirus peak in Maryland? Here’s what to know about the predictions
.W
Maryland state officials are closely watching computer models that show how the new coronavirus pandemic may unfold in the coming weeks. The scientists who designed the models say they rely on such hard data as positive and negative test results and death rates in this country and others. They consider such things as scientific studies that detail the properties of the virus. However, people’s behavior also has a big effect on the computer models’ predictions. In an effort to slow the spread of the disease COVID-19, Gov. Larry Hogan issued a stay-at-home order March 30. On social media, some Marylanders have announced they’re taking steps to “flatten the curve" by social distancing and wearing face masks. The state may be seeing signs that those efforts are working, but it’s still too early to know for sure, Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said during a news conference Tuesday. Here what you need to know about the predictions for Maryland: How does social distancing affect the predictions? Without a vaccine or a therapy to stop COVID-19, the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is through social distancing measures, Inglesby said. One person with COVID-19 can on average infect two to three others. “New generations of cases could occur every five to seven days without social distancing measures,” Inglesby said. If the virus was left to spread without social distancing, then the number of sick people, especially the critically ill, could overwhelm the state’s health care system, he said. “If our health systems were to become overwhelmed, the mortality of this virus would go sharply up and hospitals would have a difficult time providing medical care," he said. What do the predictions say this week? The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington said a peak in hospital use could come in late April. That would be just after a projected national peak in mid-April. Earlier this week, the Washington model projected Maryland would have 1,766 deaths by Aug. 4, but that prediction has since worsened, anticipating 2,326 deaths. The model also said it could range from 1,400 to 4,136. It projected more than 81,766 deaths nationwide by the same date, with a possible range of about 49,400 to 136,400. When should we expect the peak? Maryland health officials were hopeful Tuesday that the state is nearing its peak. One model used by the White House has it occurring about 10 days from now. Other models show it coming a bit later. Still, Inglesby said, models are only best estimates and don’t necessarily take into account how seriously Maryland has put social distancing measures in place. In the 24 hours preceding the news conference at which he spoke, Maryland had seen lower numbers of new cases and hospitalizations, Inglesby said. “It’s only one day of data, but if confirmed over time, it would be a very good move in the right direction," he said. Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore City health commissioner and now a George Washington University professor, said it is difficult to predict the degree and duration of the disease’s peak when the number of coronavirus infections is unknown. A lack of widespread testing in the U.S. has officials estimating where the virus trajectory is headed. “Not all patients with symptoms are even being tested. Many people are self-isolating at home,” Wen said. “And there are likely many more, even tens of thousands more, who have mild or no symptoms and don’t know they have COVID-19.” What happens when the number of cases finally decreases? A peak also doesn’t mean the pandemic is over or state directives can be lifted. “Once we’re able to bring cases down to smaller numbers in our state, it will be time to consider how to begin to ease social distancing," Inglesby said. He called for equipment for health care workers, increased health department staffing and technology to help track and isolate cases, and expanded diagnostics so that even the mildest forms of COVID-19 cases can be detected on the same day.

Three test negative for coronavirus in Maryland; one more person under review
.W
The new coronavirus continues its sweep across the globe, infecting people in dozens of countries. But there continue to be no confirmed cases in Maryland, as results for three people tested late last week came back negative. State health officials also reported Monday that one more person is being tested. Two people had previously tested negative. The Maryland Department of Health has not released any information about the people, other than most had traveled to heavily affected areas such as China. Thousands of people have been infected around the world since the outbreak began early this year. The number of cases with the disease, called COVID-19, has risen in recent days across the United States to about 100 across 11 states. Six people have died. State and national health officials have warned that there are certain to be more cases in the United States, and there could be extensive disruption to businesses and schools if closures and quarantines are needed to control the spread of the virus. It’s not clear if and when such actions will be taken, and health officials continue to say overall risks are low. “We want all Marylanders to know that we’re closely monitoring COVID-19 developments and are working with our federal, state and local partners to help keep you safe and healthy,” Robert R. Neall, Maryland’s health secretary, said in a statement Monday. “But everyone can play a role in preparedness — stay informed and use everyday healthy habits to limit your exposure to illness.” Neall’s statement came as the health department debuted a set of public service announcements about what residents can do to stave off infections with the new coronavirus, as well as other viruses such as the flu or common cold. Advice includes frequent hand washing, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, staying home from school or work when you are sick, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Also, the announcements advise preparing in the same way as you would for a snowstorm with food and medications. Also Monday, Gov. Larry Hogan attended a White House meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the federal government’s response to the virus. Hogan, the chair of the National Governors Association, participated in a teleconference with other governors about the outbreak and the federal preparations. Such teleconferences are now expected to be held weekly, according to the vice president’s office. Health officials continue to emphasize that most people infected with the coronavirus have mild symptoms and don’t require hospitalization. The respiratory disease presents in a similar way to the flu, which is widespread now. Maryland officials said last week that there have been 3,000 hospitalizations related to the flu and 40 deaths. For now, samples from suspected cases of coronavirus in Maryland are being sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But federal authorities said they have overcome issues with the tests and expect all state labs to get testing kits by the end of this week so they can get more timely results, in several hours compared with two to three days. Authorities have asked that people not buy face masks, which do little to prevent healthy people from getting sick and are needed by medical professionals. More information can be found at health.maryland.gov or by dialing 2-2-1. A panel of public health experts convened Monday by the Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health said relying on official sources, such as the state health department or the CDC, through the outbreak can slow the spread of misinformation about the virus, its effects and treatments. There is currently no specific treatment and no cure, though efforts are underway to develop a vaccine in Maryland and elsewhere. Misinformation sows division at a time when cooperation and accurate information are paramount, said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar in the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an assistant professor in Hopkins’ Department of Environmental Health and Engineering. She said the same thing happened during past public health emergencies such as with Ebola outbreak that began in Africa in 2014. “There are different efforts to blame different populations,” she said. “There are examples of some cures out there that are not going to work. There are calls for people to stockpile masks that are not effective to protect themselves. People can waste money, but they also think they are protected and take actions they shouldn’t be taking. The ‘cures’ can harm people.” Another concern is that people who have symptoms do not have access to care, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar in Hopkins’ Center for Health Security and an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering and the Department of Epidemiology. She helped create the global health security index that President Donald Trump cited last week in saying how well prepared the country is for a public health outbreak. Nuzzo said the index that ranks health care capacity and readiness of 195 countries does say the United States ranks high, but that the country had significant issues such as access to health care. That means not only ensuring there are enough properly trained doctors and nurses to safely care for patients, without spreading infections among themselves and the community, but that people don’t fear the cost so much that they avoid seeking care when they are sick. “Fear of the cost of health care is a deterrent that could create a bad situation,” Nuzzo said. “Staying home or in the community infecting others or not seeking care until late is a problem. We need to make sure the fear of cost is not a barrier to seeking care in an emergency.” The most effective action will be based on models used in the past to identify the sick, isolate them and inform the public, said Lauren Sauer, director of operations for Hopkins’ Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response and an assistant professor of emergency medicine in Hopkins’ School of Medicine. In Maryland, the only people quarantined so far are people who are awaiting test results showing whether they have the virus, but now students returning from study abroad programs are being asked to go home and self-quarantine. The University of Maryland and Towson University suspended their programs in Italy last week because of a high level of virus spread there and asked students to return to their homes. The students have been instructed to go home, not back to campus. “Most of these people would not have contracted the virus. We are doing this out of an abundance of caution,” said Joann Boughman, the senior vice chancellor for academic and student affairs at the University System of Maryland. While they are quarantining themselves, the returning students and faculty have been told to stay away from other people they are living with as much as possible. If they develop symptoms of a fever, cough, or difficulty in breathing, they are instructed to call their own physician or go to an urgent care facility. They have been told not to go to a hospital emergency room because of the risk of infecting more people if they do turn out to have COVID-19. Boughman said those with symptoms would be tested for the flu first, to rule out that before being tested for the coronavirus. The colleges and universities are developing a mechanism to make sure they are contacted in the event that a returning staff member or student gets sick. There were 136 students studying in Italy from College Park, and nine students from Towson. Additionally, nine students were told to come back from South Korea by College Park officials. State health officials have not said if they are in touch with the students or how decisions would be made about quarantining others. Baltimore Sun reporter Liz Bowie contributed to this article.

United Way’s 211 help-line calls about food, medical testing surge during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Calls are coming into the United Way’s 211 help line at four times the typical volume — with Marylanders looking for places to get tested for the coronavirus or find food. Some need help paying their bills or want to talk to someone about their fears. Franklyn Baker, president of the United Way of Central Maryland, said call takers are directing people 24 hours a day to “grab and go” sites to pick up meals and providing up-to-date information on the virus and what resources are available. “This is so unprecedented,” Baker said. “When they are seeking answers, we point them in the right direction while being as efficient and as compassionate as we can.” The United Way answered more than 15,000 calls this month, including some 1,100 on Monday alone. Baker said nearly 40% in the past week were people looking to obtain food. Another 20% had health care questions — including ones about the coronavirus. Most of the calls came from Baltimore; the United Way of Central Maryland also serves residents of the counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard. Other hotlines in Maryland also reported increases, although not as substantial as 211’s. Baltimore officials did not immediately provide data for the city’s 311 nonemergency help line. The 211 help line has been a central clearinghouse during the pandemic, with officials from Gov. Larry Hogan to the state Department of Health encouraging Marylanders to reach out to the United Way. Baker said 211 can help people find ways to manage their essential needs, as well as their mental health. In addition to food and coronavirus questions, callers can get information about housing and shelter, utilities assistance, unemployment benefits, help with tax preparation, and substance abuse and employment services. “There are over 6,000 resources available in our region,” Baker said. “We like to say, there are more than 211 reasons why one should call 211.” The team of call takers are working from home, using laptops and remote technology to connect with people in need. Among them is Ann Johnson, who has been on the other end of countless 211 calls over the past 15 years. “It is a bit different than the usual kinds of calls that we are receiving in some ways — and in others, it is very much the work we always do,” Johnson said. The first wave of increased calls came from people looking for information on the virus itself: where they could be tested, the symptoms they were experiencing and worries about their loved ones. In more recent days, she said, the calls began to shift to people looking for specific information about what businesses are closed and whether it would be safe for them to go to work or if their job was essential. The No. 1 call now is for people who need food, Johnson said. That includes seniors with health conditions who should not be outside their homes and people who are disabled who need access to resources to meet their basic needs. To support the call takers, Johnson said, the United Way has researchers scouring through all the developments related to the virus and its aftermath, so they can provide the public with accurate and timely information. The team also reaches back to callers who may need additional help or seem especially vulnerable, Johnson said. They try to make sure the people received the help they needed. In one recent case, Johnson said, a caller’s power wheelchair broke down and 211 helped make sure a new one was delivered. For people who are in severe emotional distress, Johnson said, 211 will connect them to specialized resources. She said the call takers also let seniors know they can register for daily phone calls through the state Department of Aging. At Baltimore Crisis Response Inc., Quinita Garrett said calls have ticked up some. The response center runs a 24-hour hotline for people in crisis at 410-433-5175. Calls in the Baltimore region made to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline are routed through the center. The 211 hotline also connects people to the crisis center when people are in urgent need of mental health help. Garrett, director of hotline services for the nonprofit, said the typical 100 to 150 calls they get a day has increased by about 30 to 40. Some of the calls include people worried they may have contracted the coronavirus or who are feeling depressed because they are isolated, she said. The center’s other calls involve people who are suicidal or homicidal, victims of domestic violence or those coping with grief and loss. To deal with the influx of calls to 211, the United Way has created a COVID-19 Community Fund that supports the 211 team and added new full- and part-time staff members. The nonprofit is also tapping into a growing network of volunteers. Baker said the United Way is beginning to train some of the more than 60 people who have volunteered to take calls since the pandemic broke. Still, United Way says, more volunteers are needed, especially people who have backgrounds in case management and social work.

Howard County District Court employee tests positive for coronavirus, first case within Maryland Judiciary
.W
An employee of the Howard County District Court tested positive Tuesday for the new coronavirus, making it the first confirmed case of the virus within the Maryland Judiciary. This comes as Maryland reported 61 new cases of the coronavirus Tuesday, bringing the state’s total to 349; in Howard County, the total has risen to 30. Four people have died in the state so far. According to a news release from the Maryland Judiciary, the last time the individual worked at the Ellicott City courthouse was March 12. The employee was tested March 17 and reported the results to a supervisor Tuesday. The case was then reported to the Howard County Health Department, the Maryland Department of Health and the Maryland Department of General Services. Anyone who is likely to have come into contact with the employee is being communicated with, according to the Maryland Judiciary. Certain areas of the courthouse have been sealed and will be sanitized, the release says. The Howard County District Court will remain closed to the public and is currently staffed with essential personnel to hear emergency matters.

Five new coronavirus deaths in Maryland announced Sunday afternoon, bringing state’s total to 15 
.W
Five more people in Maryland have died of the coronavirus, the Maryland Department of Health announced Sunday afternoon in a news release. The number of COVID-19 deaths rose from 10 to 15 Sunday after increasing from five to 10 Saturday. The deaths announced Sunday were a Carroll County man in his 90s; a Howard County man in his 70s; a Prince George’s County man in his 30s; a Prince George’s County woman in her 50s; and a Prince George’s County man in his 70s. All five had underlying health conditions. On Sunday morning, Maryland announced that 247 new cases had been confirmed since Saturday morning, including 72 in Carroll County after the disease spread in a Mount Airy retirement home. That brought Carroll’s total of confirmed cases to 82 and the statewide number to 1,239. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Saturday night that 66 residents of the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy had been infected with the disease and that 11 had been hospitalized. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties continued to lead the state in confirmed cases. Michael Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, wrote that 46 new cases were confirmed in Montgomery County since Saturday, raising the total number of cases to 301. Officials have confirmed 51 new cases in Prince George’s County, Ricci wrote, bringing the D.C. suburb’s total up to 247 cases. The two counties account for a little less than half of all coronavirus cases in the state. Ricci wrote that an additional 39 people have been released from isolation and that 12,534 tests for the disease have come back negative.

Maryland sees 20% increase in coronavirus recoveries as case count rises above 10,700
.W
Maryland announced an increase Thursday of more than 20% in the state’s number of recoveries from the novel coronavirus, reporting 129 more infected Marylanders have been released from isolation compared to Wednesday. In all, Maryland has reported 736 recoveries. However, the state also added 752 confirmed cases of the viral infection to its count, bringing the state’s confirmed case total to 10,784 residents. Of those, 392 have died, with 43 new victims announced Thursday. The state is also reporting 67 deaths in which the victim’s cause of death was listed as COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, but the results were not confirmed by a laboratory test. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday that as of 7 a.m. Saturday, Marylanders will be required to cover their faces when inside a retail establishment or using public transportation. He also said the state’s recovery phase would be heavily dependent on increases in Maryland’s testing capabilities, hospital surge capacity, supply of personal protective equipment and contact-tracing operations. Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for public health, said Wednesday that more than 800 Marylanders have voluntarily registered as having recovered from coronavirus, more than the state’s confirmed count, as Maryland works to increase its efforts to trace the virus among those who are infected. Speaking Thursday morning on NBC’s “Today Show,” Hogan said Maryland still is seeing significant increases in infections and deaths from the coronavirus. “Our numbers have been rapidly rising. … It’s growing throughout our region,” said Hogan, a Republican. “We are sort of the next wave of hotspots.” Hogan acknowledged some people want to ease restrictions that have been put in place to slow the spread of the virus, but said it’s too soon. Nearly 62,000 Marylanders filed for unemployment last week, bringing the state to almost 300,000 jobless claims in the past month. “Everybody wants to get our economy back and get people back to work and get our businesses open, but we also want to make sure we do it in a safe way,” he said. Despite representing less than a third of the state’s cases, infected Marylanders over the age of 60 account for nearly two-thirds of Maryland’s confirmed virus-related deaths. Age data is not available for about 24% of the state’s COVID-19 deaths. African-Americans continue to represent nearly half of Maryland’s confirmed cases and deaths among the infected whose races was known, despite only 30% of Maryland’s population being black, according to census data. The state did not report the race of 23% of those infected. As Maryland scrambles to secure adequate supplies and hospital beds for an anticipated surge in cases and hospitalizations, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted Wednesday that his state will be sending 50 ventilators to Maryland. Hogan said he and the nation’s governors would have a conference call with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence later Thursday, and he expected guidance for how to start reopening the economy would be discussed. Hogan said he’d be glad to have the federal government as a “partner” but said the decisions must rest with governors. “Different states are at different points in the curve,” he said.

Q&A: What are Maryland workers’ rights, responsibilities in the coronavirus pandemic?
.W
As the new coronavirus pandemic shifts the way people move through the world, some Marylanders are asking what their rights are in the workplace. Numerous questions about sick leave, social distancing in the office and employers’ responsibility have flooded social media this week as the COVID-19 outbreak spreads. Many workers’ rights are defined under both state and federal law. Here are a few questions from Marylanders about workers’ rights and answers from the experts: Can I force social distancing procedures to be implemented at work? Kathleen Cahill, a Baltimore-based employment attorney, said that while workers may want managers to implement social distancing procedures, such as keeping at least 6 feet between people, there isn’t a legal recourse to force employers to require them. “People without disabilities generally don’t have rights about workplace policies and practices,” Cahill said. She added that workers can ask the company to make “reasonable accommodations” under the Americans with Disabilities Act, saying that clinical anxiety is a covered condition and anxiety spurred by a lack of safe workplace practices could be a valid claim under the ADA. “If somebody has anxiety about an epidemic and wants to ask for reasonable accommodations, that could be a reasonably effective approach,” Cahill said. “Social distancing could be something they ask as a reasonable accommodation.” She said, in those cases, employees should ask the employer for a meeting to discuss those accommodations with a human relations representative to see whether they can be implemented without impugning “undue hardship” on the company. If the company then doesn’t implement those accommodations, Cahill said, the person may have a claim for unemployment benefits if they quit their job. What happens if a co-worker tests positive? Do I have the right to know who it was? Joel Smith, an attorney for AFSCME Local 3 which represents essential workers such as corrections officers and supermarket employees, said that employees should be told whether a co-worker tests positive for the coronavirus, given the contagious nature of the disease. “Certainly they have a right to know if the employer knows,” Smith said. But he said it still isn’t clear whether companies are required to share the identity of who contracted the virus with other employees, saying there’s a difference between telling co-workers who are exposed to that person on a daily basis versus those who may only have had passing exposure, if that. “We haven’t defined that obligation,” Smith said. Should I file a workers’ compensation claim if I get the coronavirus while working? Cahill said those who go to work and later test positive for COVID-19 may have a right to workers’ compensation. She said if “an employee without a disability makes complaints” about company policy regarding a lack of social distancing in line with federal guidelines and the employer refuses to implement them, they’d have at least a decent workers’ compensation claim. Could I file for unemployment if my job won’t implement social distancing? While Maryland is usually a state where if an employee leaves, they forfeit their right to collect unemployment benefits, Cahill said those who unsuccessfully try to correct policies at work to implement social distancing may have claims to unemployment benefits. Cahill and Smith said it’d be hard to define the circumstances that would lead to a successful case, as they’re evaluated on case-by-case bases. However, Cahill said “resignation for good cause can be an exception" to the law and those who can prove they tried to implement reasonably safe practices at work during a pandemic may have a claim for unemployment benefits if they quit after their employer refused to implement those practices. The two attorneys also cautioned that the standard might be determined in the coming weeks as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread and employees and employers are increasingly left to deal with the fallout. “Where that line will be in this day and age ... I can’t predict that,” Cahill said. Said Smith: “I wouldn’t offer advice on that because it’s so fact-based and so idiosyncratic. We haven’t seen the state ... come forward yet” and offer guidance. What if my employer does not provide sick time? Matt Helminiak, commissioner of labor and industry for the Maryland Department of Labor, has oversight of issues related to earned sick and safe leave in the state. Helminiak said most employees in the state are eligible for some kind of leave under the Maryland Healthy Working Families Act of 2018. Under the law, an employer with more than 15 employees is required to offer paid leave. Any employer with fewer than 15 employees must provide one hour of unpaid leave for every 30 hours worked, with the ability to accrue a maximum of 40 hours of sick leave in a year, Helminiak said. An employer does not have to provide additional paid sick leave above what is required by the law. The law does not cover some employees who perform work under a contract of hire, those who are under the age of 18 before the beginning of the year, those who are employed in the agricultural sector on an agricultural operation and some people who are employed by a temporary services agency or employment agency to provide temporary or part-time staffing services. Marylanders with questions about the exemptions are asked to email ssl.assistance@maryland.gov. Helminiak also said that the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law last week, will temporarily expand some requirements related to sick leave or family and medical leave related to COVID-19. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division has published its first round of guidance on the federal law, including a fact sheet for employees, for employers and a General Q&A. What should a person do if they do not have access to masks while working at a health care facility? The answer to this question can be complicated because there are many nonhealth care-related jobs that may require the use of a face mask, Helminiak said. Marylanders who work in the health care field and are in direct contact with COVID-19 patients should be provided with masks, he said. However, there is a nationwide shortage of face masks, respirators and other medical supplies. Some residents in the Baltimore area have taken to sewing fabric face masks for health care professionals who do not have their own at this time. The law does not require an employer to provide face masks to a staffer who does not usually require one and isn’t in direct contact with a patient, Helminiak said.

Howard County Rainbow Conference, celebrating LGBTQ community, transitions to virtual event amid coronavirus
.W
The Howard County Rainbow Conference is not being canceled and will instead be held virtually this month due to the coronavirus pandemic. The inaugural conference, which was originally planned for May 15 at Hammond High School, will still be May 15 but will consist of 14 online sessions with the goal of celebrating LGBTQ students and community members and raising awareness. Attendees will have the option of signing up for just one or several of the sessions. Danielle DuPuis, a media specialist and video production teacher at Hammond and the Rainbow Conference’s coordinator, said it was important to not cancel the event since the conference is able to still educate people virtually. The decision comes about a month after the Howard County Pride festival was canceled due to the pandemic. “This conference has been in the works for about a year and a half now. We had a lot of time invested in this conference. I really didn't want to see that time go to waste, especially since people are at home now and they’re looking for other things to do,” DuPuis said. “I thought we could do it online and have people tune in and learn from home. Especially with the LGBTQ+ community, depending on the student’s situation at home, it may be harder for them to be at home right now. So offering them a safe space is important right now.” The conference has seven time slots — from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. — with an average of two sessions per hour. The sessions range in topic, from support for transgender students, LGBTQ literature, support from allies, suicide prevention and others. Keynote speaker Mikah Meyer — an American travel journalist and LGBTQ rights advocate — has been rescheduled for the 2021 conference. The goal of the conference is to “raise visibility and awareness and to encourage allies to support LGBTQ+ youth and community members,” DuPuis said “I think there’s a lack of understanding for the community. A lot of times people say, ‘Well, I’m not gay, it doesn’t pertain to me, I’m moving on.’ Unfortunately, we do that a lot as humans, but we need each other. We need people to call out when others are being unkind to others,” she added. Registration for the free Howard County Rainbow Conference ends May 12.

Maryland, Virginia and D.C. ask to be added to federal coronavirus test site list
.W
Maryland, Virginia and Washington are asking the Trump administration to add the national capital region to the priority list of large cities receiving federally supported sites to test for the new coronavirus. While other cities on the list – such as New York and Chicago – are larger than Washington, the capital area “is home to over six million residents and the seat of the federal government,” said a letter to the president from Gov. Larry Hogan, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Washington mayor Muriel Bowser. The three governments in the region say they have been working together to identify possible drive-through testing sites for COVID-19. Those sites would be established using the federal support.

Hopkins coronavirus map incorrectly displays confirmed case in Baltimore County due to unspecified ‘mapping issue’
.W
The Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus dashboard, which displays the number of cases around the world, erroneously listed a case in Baltimore County on Monday — and then removed it, blaming an unspecified “mapping issue." Two more Marylanders — an 86-year-old Harford County woman who traveled to Turkey, and a Montgomery County man in his 60s who had traveled to Thailand and Egypt — tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the state to five as of Monday afternoon, according to Gov. Larry Hogan. The three others, who were diagnosed with the coronavirus after a cruise in Egypt, live in Montgomery County. But a sixth case, listed for hours as “confirmed” in Baltimore County, was removed from the Hopkins map after The Baltimore Sun asked about it Monday. “It was a mapping issue that has since been corrected,” university spokesman Doug Donovan said in an email. The coronavirus, which initially broke out in China late last year, has spread to more than 100,000 cases across more than 90 countries around the world. More than 600 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., with 22 of those fatal. Anxiety and a lack of reliable information about the spread of the virus worldwide prompted Hopkins to develop the online COVID Dashboard, according to Lauren Gardner, associate professor in the Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, who developed it. The cases are automatically input in China and manually input in the U.S., she said. As of last week, it was being opened 1.2 billion times a day. “This really speaks to this huge demand for trustworthy, reliable information,” Gardner said during a briefing on Capitol Hill on Friday. Six other Marylanders who were on the Egyptian cruise are in isolation and will be tested for the disease, Hogan said. Two of them are displaying symptoms. Another dozen Marylanders are aboard the Grand Princess that has been off the coast of California, but none of them are showing symptoms, Hogan said Monday. They and other passengers on the ship will be taken to military facilities for isolation. Hopkins spokeswoman Jill Rosen characterized the error on the map as a “glitch” and said she would look into its cause. She did not respond before publication time; this article will be updated if and when the university provides a response. Maryland is shifting its focus from containing the virus to mitigating its impact, Hogan said. The Republican governor has signed emergency legislation granting him the authority to transfer $50 million from the state’s “rainy day fund” for the outbreak response, he said Monday. The governor has canceled all out-of-state business travel for state employees, and he encouraged residents over 60 and with compromised health to avoid large gatherings. State officials plan to meet with representatives from the long-term care industry Tuesday to ensure older residents are being monitored and protected from exposure. “We can expect the number of cases to continue to rise,” Hogan said. Baltimore Sun reporters Pamela Wood and Scott Dance contributed to this article.

‘My biggest fear is having to deliver alone’: Maryland women deal with pregnancy in coronavirus pandemic
.W
McKenzie Redmond thought this spring would be a time to get together and celebrate as she awaits the birth of her first child, a boy. But with the growing outbreak of new coronavirus, the Pasadena resident is spending her time at home. She canceled her April baby shower. She doesn’t know who will be allowed with her when she goes to deliver. “When it’s your first, you imagine everyone celebrating with you,” said the 23-year-old hairstylist, due in July. As the pandemic disrupts daily life for Americans, expecting parents are dealing with anxieties they never thought they would face, from new restrictions on hospital visitors to fears of getting sick or exposing a newborn to the virus. In Maryland and elsewhere, the outbreak is changing the way prenatal care is delivered, with many patients attending appointments remotely through video chat. Expecting mothers face hard choices about who accompanies them in the delivery room. Redmond said she planned for her mother and sister to be with her in addition to her husband. Her hospital now allows one visitor in labor and delivery, but she doesn’t know what the rules might look like come summer. The outbreak has brought other stress, too: With salons shut down as non-essential businesses, she was laid off a few weeks ago. In New York City, a hot spot of the U.S. outbreak, some hospitals last month banned anyone from accompanying women during labor and delivery, including fathers. But this past weekend, in response to such bans, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order saying that hospitals there must allow one support person for patients giving birth. Still, news of those restrictions has shaken some local women as the pandemic intensifies in Maryland. “My biggest fear is having to deliver alone,” said 27-year-old Melana Reed of Reisterstown, due with a baby girl in July. This has been a time of “a lot of scary unknowns," said Reed, who has been working from home as a service coordinator for people with disabilities. She, too, canceled her baby shower and doesn’t know when it will be safe to hold a “welcome party” for her daughter. Her boyfriend used to come to every appointment with her, but now visitors aren’t allowed for doctor’s visits. ”It’s a traumatic experience being pregnant during this time," said Reed, adding that she’s been especially anxious because she previously suffered a miscarriage. In the Baltimore area, many hospitals are allowing only one visitor in labor and delivery. “Unfortunately for families, it may be very difficult choosing who that is,” said Dr. Robert Atlas, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, which previously allowed up to five visitors in the delivery room. “It is a trying time, to be sure." Atlas emphasized that these restrictions aim to protect “patient safety, staff safety, doctor safety." So far, there has been limited research on pregnancy and coronavirus, Atlas said. “Our biggest problem is there’s not a lot of information on this specific virus to guide us,” he said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says scientists do not know if pregnant women have a greater risk of getting the virus than the general population, or if mothers can pass the virus to their baby during pregnancy or delivery. For now, local hospitals say they are trying to protect both staff and patients by using telemedicine and finding other ways to reduce the number of visits for prenatal care. For instance, some are arranging for women to take home blood-pressure machines for self-monitoring. High blood pressure can pose risks for mothers and babies during pregnancy. At Johns Hopkins Medicine, providers are spacing out the number of in-person visits and conducting video chats for certain appointments, said Dr. Jeanne Sheffield, director of the maternal-fetal medicine division. The system has “decreased substantially" the number of gynecological patients coming to see a doctor, so there are far fewer people in the waiting rooms. For pregnant patients who need extra monitoring because of conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, they can electronically message their providers their blood pressure or blood sugar readings. "We’re able to do a lot more remote monitoring than we could before,” Sheffield said. On a recent visit to her nurse-midwife’s office, Perry Hall resident Tara Rasmussen said she walked in and most of the furniture was gone, with chairs spaced well apart. The pandemic-related restrictions have complicated plans for those who want to have a doula — a companion who provides support and comfort during childbirth. Some hospitals, like Hopkins, are allowing a visitor in addition to a doula in labor and delivery. Others are allowing one visitor only. Rasmussen, due in June, had planned to have a doula, but if her hospital’s current rules remain in place, she won’t. Rasmussen, 38, works from home as a legal operations program manager. Her husband is a full-time student and their 4-year-old son’s day care is closed because of the outbreak. Like “most other women that are in my situation, it’s just figuring it out day-by-day,” she said. “And trying to take deep breaths.” Doulas “are available to our clients 24/7” and that hasn’t changed with the pandemic, said Carling Sothoron of the Baltimore Doula Project, a volunteer-run organization that provides services on a sliding scale based on income. But now such support may come over the phone or FaceTime. “We are still very much with them the entire time, it’s just not in person,” Sothoron said. Doulas also are offering virtual classes and online support sessions, said Andrea Williams-Muhammad, a doula and co-chair of the Reproductive Health Equity Alliance of Maryland. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has found that evidence suggests that "in addition to regular nursing care, continuous one-to-one emotional support” from someone such as a doula is linked to better outcomes for women in labor. Williams-Muhammad called the new policies restricting visitors especially concerning given racial disparities in maternal mortality. Last year, the CDC reported that black, American Indian, and Alaska Native women are two to three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related complication than white women. A support person can help advocate for a woman during labor, said Williams-Muhammad, who is also program coordinator for the Baltimore Community Doula Program, which provides free services to families in the city. “The potential of not having a chosen partner there only adds to that mom’s stress,” she said, adding that she is concerned that drastic visitor restrictions could result in families having unassisted home births without the support they may need. Joanne Motino Bailey directs the University of Michigan Nurse-Midwifery Service. She’s trying to assure parents-to-be that “no matter how the birth unfolds, whatever the environment looks like, it does not take away form the sacred experience of welcoming this baby into the world." “The folks that are close to giving birth are really anxious about what the birth experience will be like,” Bailey said. For some families, the pandemic also is changing the experience of bringing a new baby home. When Arielle Seidler gave birth at Sinai Hospital in March, her husband was the only visitor allowed throughout her stay. She said doctors told them not to have any visitors around their baby girl once home. So, while her parents live “basically around the corner,” they haven’t been able to help out or visit their first grandchild. “That part’s been really tough,” said Seidler, 31, an addiction therapist who lives in Mount Washington. She feels grateful for the support of her daughter’s pediatrician, whom she recently texted with close to midnight when she was worried. “That’s been amazing," she said. And “a couple people have dropped stuff off, like extra diapers.” Redmond, the Pasadena resident, said it’s especially difficult to cope with the uncertainty of the situation — she doesn’t know what things will look like this summer, when she’s due. It’s also hard to pull away from constant stream of news about the virus, she said. “All I can do is pray,” she said.

BCCC student tests positive for new coronavirus; union says classes should’ve been canceled sooner
.W
A Baltimore City Community College student has tested positive for the new coronavirus. BCCC officials learned of the COVID-19 case on Monday and shared details with the college community in a letter sent Tuesday by president Debra McCurdy. The student was on the community college’s Liberty campus March 12 and first evaluated at a hospital with symptoms on March 16, but was sent home. The student was later admitted to a hospital March 21 and discharged March 24, McCurdy said in the letter. BCCC faculty have been in touch with the student, who is resting and at home self-quarantining, McCurdy said. “While this information is disturbing to all of us, please know that we are working to support you and your needs while learning and working in this challenging environment,” McCurdy said. Local leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — the union that represents about 200 BCCC workers in physical plant, administration, academics and public safety — said Wednesday that they were frustrated by the college’s decision not to cancel in-person classes until March 16. AFSCME Local 1870 president Kahi Fraser and vice president Salita High say the union requested on March 11 that classes be canceled on BCCC campuses. Many Maryland colleges and universities opted to cancel classes that same day. High, who has an autoimmune deficiency and is over the age of 60, believes she and other staffers were unnecessarily exposed to COVID-19 before classes were canceled. She has self-quarantined since last week. BCCC representative Dawn Kirstaetter says the college moved as “swiftly as we could" in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We didn’t make this decision casually," Kirstaetter said of the class cancellations. "We care deeply about the health and safety of our students and faculty.” Before deciding to cancel in-person classes, BCCC leaders consulted with other Maryland community college presidents. BCCC also followed recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and encouraged employees who were sick to stay home, Kirstaetter said. Fraser and High also say that BCCC officials have not informed union leadership of which buildings or staffers the sickened student visited on campus. Kirstaetter said BCCC officials have an obligation to protect the privacy of the student, but added the college conferred with the Baltimore City Health Department on response protocols. “We supplied the city health department with contact information for any student or employee who may have had contact with the diagnosed student,” Kirstaetter said. BCCC’s environmental services team has deep-cleaned campus classrooms and labs and will target additional deep cleaning before operations resume on campus, McCurdy said in the announcement. The college president asked community members to visit the BCCC website for information and to follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Maryland hospitals plan for surge of coronavirus patients, worry about potential ‘mismatch between demand and resources’ 
.W
Maryland’s four dozen hospitals are scrambling to prepare for a potential surge of patients sickened by the new coronavirus. Officials are upgrading old flu pandemic plans and inventorying protective gear, medical equipment, staff and beds. They are, however, facing some tough math. Federal authorities have estimated that a moderate outbreak like the flu pandemic in 1968 would mean 1 million people hospitalized, including 200,000 needing intensive care. If it’s more like the severe 1918 flu pandemic, 2.9 million could need the ICU. If Maryland had a proportional share of severely ill patients based on its population, hospitals would need roughly 3,700 ICU beds for a moderate outbreak to 53,000 for a severe one. According to the state Health Care Commission from fiscal year 2018, the latest publicly available, the state has only about 1,200 ICU beds. “We are sprinting to make sure we don’t have to shift to a crisis standard of care,” said Dr. David Marcozzi, who leads COVID-19 preparedness for the University of Maryland Medical System, which has about 200 ICU beds among its 13 hospitals. “We are putting every step in place so that if we do get a surge in patients, we have the ability to maintain a standard level of care.” Marcozzi said demand for crisis care is what overwhelmed hospitals in Italy. Maryland has a total of about 9,400 hospital beds, which serve medical, surgical, ob-gyn, pediatric and psychiatric patients. Hospitals will continue to treat patients in need, such as heart attack victims and pregnant women, but could reassess offering elective procedures, officials say. So far, Maryland only has 12 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, and few are hospitalized. Several are considered recovered. But the state logged its first case of “community spread,” a case in which a person did not travel to a heavily affected country or knowingly come into contact with an infected person. More such cases are expected, said Dr. Timothy Chizmar, state EMS medical director at the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems. MIEMSS, which coordinates the statewide emergency medical system, has been taking a daily census of available hospital beds, as well as things such as ventilators that are likely to be in high demand for COVID-19′s sickest patients, Chizmar said. Since the count began earlier this month, beds have been up to 90 percent full. Chizmar said hospitals across the country are required by their accrediting agency to plan for surges and be able to add a minimum of 10% to 20% more beds in unused areas of the hospitals. He said they likely could add far more. They also could work with state health officials to move patients that do not need critical care and cancel elective procedures altogether. Some already have tents set up outside to triage potential coronavirus cases, a measure that adds space and protects health care workers and other inside from infection. Chizmar said extra medical staff could come from health care positions outside of hospitals or workers willing to add hours. “There is an element that we don’t know what’s coming," he said. “We have had the opportunity to get a jump start on this, so I feel we have that advantage." Chizmar said closing schools and businesses and canceling events may seem like an extreme response with so few local cases, but it’s designed to restrain the growth of cases so medical providers don’t have to face an untenable situation in which there isn’t enough care. Health systems across the country will be tested, he said. There are more than 1,663 cases nationwide and 40 deaths reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The country has about 46,500 ICU beds and “perhaps an equal number of other ICU beds that could be used in a crisis,” according to a recent assessment from researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Health Security. But, it added, “Even spread out over several months, the mismatch between demand and resources is clear.” Bob Atlas, CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association, said no one knows how many cases there will be, but hospital and state officials are working on “creative and flexible” ways to ensure everyone who needs care gets it. He added that not every coronavirus patient will need the ICU. Health officials have said about 80% of cases are expected to be mild to moderate and 20% more serious. “The question is not how many beds there are, but how many places people can be cared for when they’re ill and what is the appropriate level of care for each one,” he said. “Hospital space can and will be made quickly available with a surge of critically ill patients," Atlas said. “Many hospitals have activated their emergency response plans to be ready for community need. ... Remember that responding to disasters is not new to hospitals. Emergency preparedness is a year-round activity that is done within each facility, health system, and region.” For now, hospitals say they’re preparing as they go about their business of caring for patients. Johns Hopkins Medicine, for example, said it has not canceled elective procedures, though Hopkins hospitals and many others have limited visitors to protect their patients. A real concern is the health of medical providers, said Gene Ransom, CEO of MedChi, the state association of doctors. If they get sick they can’t treat patients. He said it’s critical that people with symptoms do not go to the emergency room, where they can infect staff and other sick patients. They need to call their health care provider or the health department. If they are deemed a candidate for testing, officials will develop a plan, he said. An issue so far, however, has been a lack of testing, which Ransom said means no one knows how many people already have the virus or where they may spread it, potentially including in emergency departments. “There is a level of anger at the federal government for how badly they have handled the issue,” he said of the slow rollout of test kits and the narrow parameters of people allowed to be tested. The Maryland Department of Health reported Wednesday that the state had run tests on samples for about 90 people, resulting in the 12 positives. The state is no longer saying how many tests it’s running. And, beyond the state lab, officials have not said just where the samples can be analyzed after a doctor orders a test and a hospital takes a nose or throat swab. MedChi is encouraging medical staff to use telemedicine whenever possible. Ransom said such systems even could be used to allow quarantined doctors and nurses to continue treating patients from home isolation if they are well enough. Mostly, he said, he wants the public and hospitals to all follow guidance to prevent staff or patients from getting the new coronavirus. Hospitals need good screening processes, for example, and plans for when people come in with symptoms without calling first. “We have to be concerned about this situation,” he said. “No physician alive has dealt with something like this. We need to act as if it’s going to be bad. If it’s really severe we simply won’t have the capacity to handle it.”

Maryland reports first coronavirus death as cases surge and hospitals plan to add beds
.W
A Prince George’s County man in his 60s became Maryland’s first resident to die of the novel coronavirus, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday night. The man died from the COVID-19 illness acquired through community transmission, officials said. He suffered from underlying health problems, they said. “I ask all Marylanders to join me in praying for his family and loved ones during this difficult time,” Hogan said. “As we pray for his loved ones, I ask that we continue to pray for each other, for our state, and for our nation as we face this crisis together.” The man’s death came as confirmed coronavirus cases surged dramatically for a second straight day in Maryland — including several that suggested the pathogen is circulating in Baltimore — and hospitals prepared for a surge in patients, including Mercy Medical Center, which received emergency state approval for an immediate $12.5 million expansion. Mercy expects to build a 32-bed acute-care unit atop its downtown Baltimore hospital in about 2½ months, helping to address a need for as many as 6,000 additional hospital beds in what Hogan called a worst-case scenario. Other hospitals in the state have been readying triage tents and looking at ways to free up space to add beds. The state’s number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections rose 49% to 85 on Wednesday. That included five cases in Baltimore, where Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young declared a state of emergency and health commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said “it’s clear that there’s been community transmission" of the coronavirus. Among the infected is a caregiver at Northwest Hospital in Randallstown, LifeBridge Health officials said. The coronavirus arrived in Maryland two weeks ago when the first three positive cases were confirmed March 5. As it has spread throughout the world, the respiratory illness has sickened more than 215,000 people and killed more than 8,700. In the United States, despite problems with testing availability, more than 7,700 cases have been confirmed and 119 have died, including the Prince George’s County man. Just days after Hogan ordered restaurant dining rooms, bars, gyms and movie theaters closed, he said he will hold a news conference at 10 a.m. Thursday in Annapolis to “provide further updates and announce additional actions.” “We should continue to expect the number of cases to dramatically and rapidly rise,” Hogan said Monday. “This is going to be much harder, take much longer and be much worse than almost anyone is currently understanding." State and local health officials continued to urge residents to stay home and stop the spread of the outbreak. Electronic signs over the state’s highways alerted drivers Wednesday: “SAVE LIVES NOW, STAY HOME.” Economic dominoes continued to fall as infection cases rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking an additional 1,300 points, enough to erase all gains over the past three years. Unemployment insurance claims surged across the country, and in Maryland, where state labor officials said they received 5,400 jobless claims Monday, five times the normal rate. Both state and federal lawmakers acted in response. As the Maryland General Assembly adjourned early for the first time since the Civil War, it passed emergency legislation extending unemployment benefits to those who have to leave their jobs due to risk of coronavirus exposure or to care for an infected relative. Congress sent a bill to President Donald Trump extending paid leave to many Americans affected by the pandemic. And a growing list of universities, including Johns Hopkins and Morgan State, canceled in-person classes for the rest of the semester and started looking at alternatives for graduations. Among new COVID-19 cases in Maryland that were revealed Wednesday, 23 involved people 19 to 64 years old. Five people age 65 or older were reported infected. The coronavirus is especially dangerous to the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Harford County officials declared a state of emergency as they announced their third case Wednesday, involving a 47-year-old man who lives in the county but tested positive and self-isolated while working in Boston. County Executive Barry Glassman said the declaration was needed for “flexibility in maintaining county government functions during the public health crisis.” In Baltimore County, the infected health care provider at Northwest Hospital informed staff and went into a home quarantine. Officials at LifeBridge, the hospital’s owner, said individuals who may have come in contact with the person were identified and that the hospital is “following our internal protocols, including state and federal guidelines, to determine the next appropriate steps.” LifeBridge also said a patient tested positive for COVID-19 at Sinai Hospital in Northwest Baltimore. The person is “doing well" and is expected to be discharged soon, officials said. The American Red Cross urged healthy people to donate blood. The pandemic has forced organizers of about 2,700 blood drives across the country to cancel events that would have been expected to draw some 86,000 donors. As Maryland prepares for an expected surge in patients infected with COVID-19, which causes pneumonia and organ failure in the most extreme cases, Hogan said state and hospital officials are gearing up for an expected surge in patients. Hogan said Monday that the state planned to add 6,000 acute-care hospital beds to the 8,000 it already has. The next day, the Maryland Hospital Association and state health officials said so many more beds likely will not be required due to Hogan’s aggressive social distancing orders, calling that a worst-case-scenario need. But in several cable news appearances Wednesday, Hogan reiterated the planning for adding 6,000 beds. “We don’t have time to wait,” he said during a morning interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Hogan said state officials have looked into opening closed hospital facilities and working with the National Guard and the private sector to add more beds and find staff to attend to the possible surge in patients. But Mercy is perhaps the first hospital to announce a significant addition amid the coronavirus outbreak. It will construct the expansion on the 17th floor at its Mary Catherine Bunting Center, which opened on St. Paul Street in 2010. The construction plan moved forward after the Maryland Health Care Commission granted Mercy an emergency certificate of need, the hospital said. Other hospitals, such as the Greater Baltimore Medical Center and those in the University of Maryland Medical System, have instead pitched temperature-controlled tents in which they could quickly add extra beds for patients in the event of a surge. The tents popped up in parking garages and lots adjacent to the hospitals. “Mercy is committed to doing everything we can to serve our community and create additional capacity to provide critical health services during this crisis,” said Thomas R. Mullen, president and CEO of Mercy Health Services, in a statement. “This project is a major investment during a time of great uncertainty but it’s the right thing to do and will be essential to address the potential surge in patients in need of hospitalization in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The hospital said it has partnered with Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., based in Towson, on the project. The giant construction firm will provide short-term financing to allow the project to move forward as quickly as possible, Mercy said.

Harford County executive forecasts coronavirus damaging budget; longer shutdown could mean layoffs for many counties
.W
Though the presentation of the county’s proposed budget is usually done in-person, Harford County Executive Barry Glassman is preparing a video presentation of his budget to be shown to county council and county-funded agencies. That’s not the only thing about the budget that will change this year, he said, forecasting the coronavirus-related shutdown of local businesses to have “severe" effects on Harford’s fiscal situation. The closure of businesses and record unemployment rates mean a hit to one of the county’s primary revenue sources: income taxes, Glassman said. That forces some tough decisions to be made, he said, and a reexamination of the coming fiscal year’s budget — which was mostly complete and about ready to be presented before the outbreak — with an eye toward trimming expenses. “We were having a pretty good year and on track with our projections ... . Since that time, and for the last few weeks when I have begun to make some of my final cuts and final decisions, is when the state pulled the plug on the local economy,” Glassman said. "This last quarter and probably the next quarter are going to be pretty devastating to not only Harford County but most local governments.” The short-term pecuniary damage could be minor compared to a longer-term shutdown. Because counties draft their budgets based on past expenses and revenues, the coronavirus-related closures and unemployment could mightily skew the basis for their future budget projections. Though previously conservative spending has left Harford County with a $20.2 million unassigned fund balance in its general fund to weather the storm in the short-term, Glassman said a longer shutdown would leave many counties gasping for air. "If this shutdown goes into six months to eight months, I can tell you … this time next year when I am preparing the budget, a lot of county governments and municipal governments around the state are going to be looking at furloughs and layoffs,” he said. “I already know I am going to take a hit this year, and then the next budget starts in June.” Because of that, Glassman is revisiting the budget for fiscal year 2021, which starts July 1, to look for savings. He said some capital projects may be put on hold, but “everything is on the table.” “We may not feel the brunt of this until we do our budget next March,” Glassman said. “We are going to have to look at drastic cuts, and that includes furloughs and layoffs.” Because county government remains open for business, it has not saved money from closing departments or curtailing services. Coupled with a potential reduction in income taxes, which Glassman said could be 20% to 30%, the county is considering its options. In fiscal year 2020, income tax accounted for 31% of the county’s approved revenue, which translated to $233.5 million, according to the county’s past budget. Glassman did not specify what precisely would be cut but said it would be apparent when the budget is presented April 13. Asked if school funding would be cut, he said that education, public safety and county workers have been a priority for his administration. Harford County Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson said he has not revised his budget request of approximately $503 million, which the school board adopted on Feb. 9, but acknowledged that it will likely need to be adjusted “to address the evolving circumstances related to this crisis.” “We have not formally revised the budget," he said in a text message. “At this point, the budget sits with the County Executive and we will wait to see his recommendation.” Glassman also pointed out that he is able to revise the budget approximately six months after it takes effect if it is too optimistic. But already the budget is halving its projected growth in income tax. Normally, income tax revenue grows by approximately 3% annually, Glassman said, but this year’s proposed budget is projecting only a 1.5% increase. Though income tax is expected to take a downward turn, property tax is not expected to fluctuate, and there is minimal danger of people losing their homes, Glassman said. "We do not at this point see a direct impact yet on property tax revenue... meaning that we do not see this as an extended recession that will cause folks to lose their homes,” he said. In fiscal year 2020, property tax generated nearly $317.5 million for the county, making up 42% of its approved revenue, according to the budget. The budget will be shown to the county council and county-funded agencies on April 13 and introduced as legislation on April 14, director of governmental and community relations Cindy Mumby said.

At Virtual Taxpayers’ Night, Baltimore City officials warn of the coronavirus pandemic’s heavy economic toll
.W
Baltimore officials held a Virtual Taxpayers’ Night to solicit residents’ feedback on the proposed 2021 budget, but acknowledged the plan will have to be almost entirely reworked to account for economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Under normal circumstances, people would gather at the War Memorial building downtown to testify on what should be included in the upcoming fiscal year’s budget. But given the restrictions on large gatherings intended to slow the spread of the virus, such a meeting was deemed impossible. Residents instead called in Tuesday to a virtual meeting, though it was sparsely “attended.” There were roughly 20 minutes of public testimony, much of it questioning why Baltimore continues to allocate so much of its budget to its police department. Carlton Perry, who identified himself as a lifelong Baltimore resident, said he worries that the budget as proposed is too focused on law enforcement spending. It calls for a more than $557 million police budget, an increase of roughly $21 million over last fiscal year. “The current issues we are facing right now are issues we can’t simply police our way out of,” Perry said. "What we need is a budget that’s fairly allocated, a budget that addresses public health, economic resource disparities and community-based law enforcement. “We need something that’s going to help the people and citizens try to remedy some of the ground that we’ve lost due to the pandemic.” Budget Director Bob Cenname cautioned that the proposal was preliminary, and didn’t take into account coronavirus-related projections. The budget plan will have to be reworked by the time the Board of Estimates votes on it in early May. “The preliminary budget plan we have released was unfortunately outdated the minute it hit the press,” Cenname said. Still, officials wanted to make it public so that people could offer feedback. The pandemic, and the measures imposed to try to stop it from spreading, have upended economic activity and crushed the city’s usual revenue streams. Officials say the city will bring in far less money tied to tourism, transportation and income taxes. Cenname expects Baltimore will end the fiscal year with a $42.3 million deficit. Democratic City Council President Brandon Scott on Tuesday called for the city to use $25 million from its rainy day fund to support small businesses, laid-off workers and homeless people as they cope with the fallout. During Cenname’s presentation, he said drawing from that emergency fund must be a “last resort” to balance the budget, after all other reasonable options have been exhausted. He said the city’s reserves — there’s about $145 million in the fund — help it maintain a strong credit rating. The city’s finance department is also forecasting that the city will bring in about $100 million less in revenue than anticipated for the fiscal year that begins in July. And while Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young has instituted a nonessential hiring and spending freeze, the city is still having to pay millions for emergency expenses related to the virus. That’s why many of the details in the preliminary budget, which was drafted before the pandemic hit, are expected to change significantly. “This budget,” Scott said, “is very, very much in flux.”

Eight Baltimore Police officers who previously tested positive for the coronavirus return to work
.W
Eight Baltimore Police officers who previously tested positive for the coronavirus have recovered and returned to work at the agency that has largely been unscathed by the pandemic. “Right now, we aren’t seeing any staffing shortages. The members are coming to work,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said at a news conference outside City Hall Wednesday. "More people are back to work, and fewer people are quarantined.” Some agencies, including New York City, have seen large numbers of officers call out of work due to infection or potential exposure. Harrison said the department continues to finalize its contingency plan should a large number of officers become ill or exposed. Previously, the department was forced to close its Southwestern District after an officer tested positive. Other officers at the district were screened or tested before returning to work, and the building reopened after cleaning. The pandemic has also forced changes throughout the department. All current recruit classes are now being taught online instead of at the agency’s new police academy building at the University of Baltimore campus downtown. Weekly ComStat meetings where commanders discuss crime trends have been postponed, but commanders continue to hold daily conference calls, which include COVID-19 concerns, a police spokeswoman said. The department has planned to hold ComStat virtually. A total of 20 police officers and four civilian employees have tested positive for COVID-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic, and 27 members remain quarantined, the police department said in a statement Wednesday. Additionally, 332 employees have been quarantined for potential exposure, including travel from high-risk areas or because they showed possible symptoms of COVID-19, which includes fever and difficulty breathing. Of those who were quarantined, 305 have been cleared to return to work, police said. The pandemic has also changed how officers respond to calls, including requiring officers to use their judgement for low-level offenses to reduce potential exposure of the disease. Violence, however, has not slowed as 81 people have been killed so far this year, up from 78 at the same time last year. Another 156 people have been injured in shootings, down from 179 last year. In addition to the decline in non-fatal shootings, Harrison said the department has an improved homicide clearance rate of 55% for the first four months of the year. He attributed both to improvements to enforcement and training, despite having to deal with the ongoing pandemic. “It shows and demonstrates we can change because this crisis has caused us to change very rapidly. We’ve done it, and out members have done a very good job of adapting to it," he said. But the department could face another challenge from potential pay cuts, furloughs and layoffs as City Hall braces for a $103 million revenue shortfall next year. Harrison said he understands the “unprecedented times” but has advocated that police positions and salaries remain untouched, that there is “no negative impact to policing operations, our employment and, or the pay,” he said. The department is short 300 officers, according to a staffing plan released last year. The agency continues to hire for new officers, including hosting a recent “virtual job fair” at Morgan State University. “The Baltimore Police Department is hiring during COVID-19. Are you currently seeking a career that offers stability and much more?” one tweet from the department’s recruitment unit reads.

Baltimore Police officer and two EMS workers test positive for coronavirus
.W
The Baltimore City fire department has temporarily closed a fire station after learning that employees of the station in the 400 block of McMechen St. may have been exposed to EMS workers who tested positive for COVID-19, according to a statement from the department. “Temporarily suspending operations from this fire station is a precautionary measure for the agency. We are taking strides to protect our members and the community,” Chief Niles Ford said. One firefighter is hospitalized and the other remains at home recovering after contracting COVID-19, officials said at a news conference outside City Hall on Thursday. The police officer has been quarantined at home for over a week after he was made aware of potential exposure, Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said. Harrison said he has talked with the officer and described him as in “good spirits,” adding that he and others are “praying for the officer’s full recovery.” Harrison said that after the officer was quarantined, additional steps were taken to disinfect the officer’s work area. A department statement said the officer was assigned to the Eastern District and has been off while awaiting test results. Fire Chief Niles Ford said his department would assist the health department investigation to trace the two "members’ whereabouts inside and outside the department to determine where and when they contracted COVID-19.” Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said her agency would conduct "a contact trace investigation” to examine who the infected people came in contact with, and then alert those people so they can self-quarantine, a key to limiting the spread of COVID-19. She said first responders are at an increased risk “because they are at the front line with ill residents.” Dzirasa said the city was notified Thursday of the positive test results. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said the city is “doing everything humanly possible to protect our first responders,” by providing them with masks, gloves, wipes and other gear as advised by public health experts. He said the city doesn’t know whether officers picked up the virus at work or while in their own communities. “We’re looking into it all,” he said. It’s unclear how many other officers could potentially be asked to self-quarantine based on whether they had contact with the people who are sick. No officers or firefighters had previously tested positive in Baltimore. Several fire department members were quarantined after they came into contact with people potentially infected with COVID-19. Last week, six were evaluated after coming into contact with a possible coronavirus patient, but they were released after they showed no symptoms. A day later, three fire department members were placed off duty after transferring a patient with suspected coronavirus. The patient tested negative for the virus and the three members were cleared to return to work. The announcement follows repeated warnings from leaders of the union representing Baltimore Police officers, who have complained that the department lacks enough supplies for officers to protect themselves. Items they said are lacking included hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes and face masks. Union leaders even sent out a plea seeking donations from the public. Both the police and fire departments have instituted new procedures to limit staff exposure to the disease, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks. Both agencies now require members to wear masks, gloves, and gowns when dealing with potentially infected individuals. Additionally, the police department has closed its facilities to the public.

Maryland’s local governments brace for sharp decline in revenues as they fight coronavirus 
.W
As local governments in Maryland race to contain the spread of coronavirus, they know another enormous challenge is just around the corner —balancing their budgets amid an economic and health crisis. The outbreak has ramped up just as local budget directors around the state are preparing spending plans for the coming fiscal year that begins in July. On Friday, Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young ordered a freeze on nonessential hiring and spending. Young, a Democrat, said the city must be “fiscally prudent as we navigate this unprecedented emergency.” The move does not affect the hiring of police officers, paramedics, firefighters and other public safety workers. “The hiring and spending freeze represents a pair of necessary first steps to ensure that as revenues continue to decline, we remain in a position to quickly respond to the needs of our residents and first responders," Young said in an announcement. As businesses shutter and more Marylanders lose their jobs, local finance officials are trying to sort out just how badly the economic fallout will hurt revenue streams — including income and hotel taxes, casino revenues and local fees. "This has come up so fast and we haven’t seen anything like this before,” said Kevin Kinnally, associate director of the Maryland Association of Counties, which has been fielding calls from local budget directors this week. "Obviously this is going to have a massive impact on state and local economies.” Adding to the uncertainty is that no one knows how long business closures and travel restrictions will last. “It’s hard for them to predict the timeline here,” Kinnally said of local finance officials. “It’s really hard right now to be a revenue estimator.” State lawmakers passed an emergency bill that allows Gov. Larry Hogan to take up to $50 million out of the state’s rainy day fund to respond to coronavirus. Additionally, lawmakers put a provision in the state budget that allows him to use another $100 million on top of that. Andrew Schaufele, director of the state’s Bureau of Revenue Estimates, said while it’s clear the pandemic will have significant effects on tax revenues, it is too early to make specific projections. “I think it could run a gamut of scenarios,” he said. Maryland’s workforce may be somewhat protected relative to the rest of the country because of its higher proportion of employees in the government and professional-services sectors, who can work remotely while offices are closed. Still, “we are absolutely losing money from lost work,’ he said. For counties around the country, “our costs are going up at the same time that our revenue will plummet,” said Matthew Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties. In recent years, American counties have already seen “massive demands” on social safety net programs as the middle class struggles and communities grapple with opioid addiction, Chase said. Now local health departments are the “ground troops” in the fight against coronavirus. The association is pushing for access to personal protective equipment for first responders and health care workers, as well as for federal assistance for small businesses and for vulnerable populations. This week, the U.S. Conference of Mayors wrote to congressional leaders, requesting $250 billion in federal emergency assistance to cities — from help covering overtime costs of city employees to assistance for residents who can’t pay their rent or mortgage. Baltimore City Councilman Eric Costello, a Democrat and chair of the budget committee, said he expects a briefing from the city finance director early next week. But he’s anticipating that the costs associated with the pandemic will be “unlike anything we’ve seen before.” He’s thinking ahead to the impact on the hospitality sector, and how quickly the city’s unemployment rate will rise. “We are in dire need of federal and state assistance, as is every other major city in the country,” Costello said. Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. said the pandemic will require “an unprecedented response” from government. Even though the focus now is on the health emergency, his staff is contemplating the long-term economic effects. “Every day the situation is changing," said Olszewski, a Democrat. "We’re seeing more cases, and it’s hard to tell where this will end.” It is clear that the crisis will put “tremendous pressure on local jurisdictions,” said County Councilman David Marks, a Perry Hall Republican. “We’re going to need to do everything we can to temporarily help businesses that are shut down and individuals that are out of work,” Marks said. Olszewski’s budget proposal is due to the County Council in mid-April. Typically, the county executive delivers the budget message in a formal speech at the Towson courthouse, attended by local leaders and county employees. But with government offices closed and crowds deemed dangerous to public health, this year’s could look different. “Will he deliver an online budget broadcast?” Marks said. "I suspect he will.” Baltimore Sun reporters Talia Richman and Pamela Wood contributed to this article.

‘This is my contribution’: Deaf ASL interpreters ensure Gov. Hogan’s coronavirus briefings are accessible
.W
Deaf since contracting scarlet fever at age 3, John McKenny has faced struggles staying informed. It doesn’t help that, at 95 years old, his vision is fading, too. With the worldwide coronavirus pandemic ongoing, McKenny yearns to understand how to best protect himself and others. But on-screen captions on most news reports go by too quickly for the Kingsville resident to read, if they’re even there at all. The 1945 graduate of the Maryland School for the Deaf is brought back to the feelings of his youth. “Often, when news was happening,” McKenny said, “I felt very left out.” McKenny is one of about 1.2 million deaf and hard-of-hearing Marylanders who are not only facing the coronavirus pandemic, but also striving to stay informed about it. They’re helped by the presence of a Certified Deaf Interpreter at Gov. Larry Hogan’s news conferences. Each time Hogan presents an update to Maryland, a CDI is feet from his side, relaying the governor’s message in American Sign Language to his fellow members of Maryland’s deaf and hard-of-hearing community. In recent weeks, that CDI has been Jimmy Beldon, who is contracting with the Mid-Atlantic Interpreting Group to stand beside Hogan as he updates the public. At a time when information is vital, Beldon, a 54-year-old resident of Frederick, recognizes the importance of his presence. “I feel that this is my contribution,” Beldon said through interpreter Nancy Bender, “that I'm able to level the playing field for people who communicate using sign language.” Beldon is not alone at Hogan’s news conferences. He and Jesse Conrad, who signed at Hogan’s earlier coronavirus updates as well as this year’s State of the State Address, have been paired with hearing ASL interpreters, who stand off-camera at each briefing. One of Anna Rose, Patty Moers-Patterson, Becky Frey or Katey Nash has served as that hearing interpreter, translating Hogan and other officials’ spoken English into ASL, which the CDI then relays with added expression and emphasis that bolster the deaf audience’s understanding. “Our first priority is to keep Marylanders safe, healthy, and informed," Hogan said in a statement. "Our administration is committed to ensuring that our citizens receive timely and equal access to critical information. I am proud to have a Certified Deaf Interpreting team at all of my press conferences. "When I said that we are all in this together, I meant it, and we will get through this together.” The director of the Governor’s Office of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing said Hogan’s commitment to accessibility is inspiring, setting a precedent for other states. “We’ve been called on to provide technical assistance to other states in terms of sharing what we have been doing here in Maryland," Kelby Brick said through Rose. "Governor Hogan has always been committed to making sure every constituent in the state of Maryland knows what’s going on, on a daily basis. “Our lives depend on that, particularly in this case.” ‘One of the best’ A third-generation deaf American, Beldon grew up in a family where ASL was everyone’s first language. His mother, Elizabeth, was a deaf interpreter herself. He knows others in the community weren’t as lucky. “So many deaf people in the country do not grow up in deaf families,” Beldon said. “They really don’t start their language acquisition until they arrive at school, so there’s a tremendous delay." That created a desire to help. Beldon has spent a quarter-century in the interpreting field. The former vice president of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, he helps train hearing and deaf interpreters, with Brick among his pupils. His children are deaf, too. One of his sons, James Paul, has interpreted Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s announcements during the pandemic, which Beldon points out proudly. “Within the deaf community,” Beldon said, "this is such an important role.” That is especially true in the present, when information can save lives. A 2011 Johns Hopkins study determined more than one-fifth of Americans age 12 or older are considered deaf or hard of hearing. Per capita, Maryland’s deaf community is one of the nation’s largest, Brick said. “We’re so fortunate to have him local in the state of Maryland and be able to take advantage of all he has to offer,” Brick said. “Many people will tell you Jimmy’s one of the best in the business.” Once an upcoming press briefing is announced, Beldon coordinates with Brick and his office to learn the focus of the news conference and which government officials will be attending. “I definitely don’t want to be standing there cold without information and just kind of spontaneously winging it,” Beldon said. “It’s so important to create that equivalent message.” Once he’s in Annapolis, he and his hearing partner go over what they each know. Neither, however, is provided with Hogan’s full speech in advance. They are interpreting on the fly, with the background knowledge Brick and others provided helping guide them. “This is incredibly important work," Beldon said. “For all deaf and hard-of-hearing people in Maryland to have this kind of access, this direct access, it sends a strong message, a very important message." With Beldon, Maryland’s deaf community knows it’s receiving a clear, accurate interpretation of Hogan’s updates, said Gina D’Amore, the president and CEO of the Mid-Atlantic Interpreting Group. “People really value his message,” D’Amore said through Bender. “When he’s bringing the content to the masses, people know it’s accurate. They have a lot of faith in what he’s saying." All about access Not all in the deaf community can watch Beldon. He and D’Amore mentioned the struggles to inform the deaf-blind. Brick’s office also is concerned about those without internet access, encouraging “video phone trees” where people who have seen the press conferences or Brick’s short social media videos spread the word to those who haven’t. The hope is to find more ways to make information accessible for all, and D’Amore said Hogan’s use of a CDI certainly helps. Although it was once routine for a hearing interpreter to work alone at public addresses, tandem deaf and hearing interpreters have become more common, to the benefit of native ASL speakers. The language occupies a three-dimensional space, while English is linear. Brick, also a CDI, used the example of spreading his fingers apart to demonstrate people spacing out, reflecting social distancing guidelines. Beldon referenced placing the federal government above the state government to show funding flowing downward. CDIs also add context with emotion and emphasis, said Janet Weinstock, the secretary of Maryland Deaf Senior Citizens Inc. Although captions are better than nothing, they lack the physical cues that an interpreter such as Beldon provides, added David Tossman, a spokesman for the Howard County Association of the Deaf. “They really convey the exact same emotion that the speaker is,” Weinstock said by phone through the Sorenson Video Relay Service. “The signs are stronger. There’s more emphasis. There’s more expression. "I just can understand it at a whole different level.” President Donald Trump’s press briefings don’t feature an on-screen interpreter, and because they are broadcast live, they generally lack immediate captions. Larry Gray, the chair of the Maryland Advisory Council for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, said that if there are no interpreters or captions, those who are deaf might wait hours for transcripts or news reports before they can be as informed as hearing individuals. An on-screen interpreter also helps normalize deaf individuals’ needs to those who can hear, Gray said. “It’s about access, as such critical information can save lives,” Gray said in an email. Beldon’s presence helps spread that potentially life-saving information. “To know that Maryland is really improving access to communication, I’m really humbled and honored to be a part of this entire effort,” Beldon said. “I just hope it’s something that continues.”

Two more Harford sheriff’s deputies test positive for coronavirus, as office seeks to curtail spread
.W
Two more Harford County Sheriff’s Office employees tested positive for the novel coronavirus Monday morning — days after the office reported its first confirmed case. A supervisor assigned to the Investigative Services Bureau tested positive for the virus last week, Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler announced in a statement Friday. The supervisor had been non-symptomatic when he was last in the workplace March 26 and stayed home after first noticing symptoms, sheriff’s office spokeswoman Cristie Hopkins said. After that test came back positive, the sheriff’s office began tracking and informing those who the deputy had contact with and could have been exposed to the virus, in accordance with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, to halt its spread. Monday, Hopkins said tests of two additional sheriff’s office personnel came back positive. Test results of six more sworn and civilian personnel are still forthcoming, she said. A seventh employee’s test came back negative Monday, Hopkins said. “We would like to have come through this pandemic without exposure or transmission to any of our personnel but recognized that was an unlikely possibility,” Hopkins wrote in an email. “We are focused on reducing the spread and maintaining the safety of Harford County citizens during this unprecedented time.” Hopkins said the two detectives who tested positive work at the Investigative Service Bureau in Forest Hill alongside the first person to test positive, though she said it was not for the sheriff’s office to determine if the cases were related. As detectives, she said, the two would have had some public exposure. They stayed home from the onset of mild symptoms, where they are now recovering. The other six who are being tested work throughout the department, Hopkins said, and their assignments will be made public if they return a positive test. After discovering the first case, Hopkins said, the sheriff’s office’s Forest Hill building was sterilized by an outside company. Some staff are wearings masks “where deemed appropriate," Hopkins said, and approximately 44% of the office’s civilian employees are teleworking. The office has taken several steps to reduce the likelihood of transmitting the virus among officers and the public — instituting a telephone reporting unit to remotely take reports of crimes, distributing personal protective equipment to deputies, closing its lobby and encouraging telework, among others. The deputy who first tested positive is feeling better and is expected to make a full recovery, Gahler said in the statement. Hopkins said he was anxious to return to work when he can. In another statement posted Saturday, the office said that a worker from the Harford County Detention Center’s medical services provider had tested positive for the virus. That worker was non-symptomatic when last at the jail on March 27, and a test for that employee came back positive approximately one week later. There is no indication that they were contagious while working in the jail, according to the statement. “At this time, we have NO inmates or correctional deputies diagnosed with COVID-19, but we are prepared if such is to occur,” the statement says. The sheriff’s office has a plan in case the virus breaks out at the jail, Gahler said in a previous interview. The jail has adopted screening guidelines for incoming arrestees and people reporting for weekend detention, checking their temperature on arrival, isolating inmates with a temperature higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately notifying medical personnel, who will check the inmate for other symptoms of COVID-19. Currently, all visitation at the jail is suspended to prevent the virus’ transmission. The Maryland Department of Health reported over 4,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Monday morning, corresponding to 91 deaths and over 1,000 hospitalizations. Harford County, according to the data, has confirmed 55 cases of the respiratory virus. This story may be updated.

First Maryland resident being tested for coronavirus, state health department says
.W
A Maryland resident is being tested for the new coronavirus that has sickened thousands and killed dozens in an outbreak that began in — and remains centered in — China but has crept to other countries in recent days. The person or their location was not identified by the Maryland Department of Health, which said the patient is in good condition and being monitored while awaiting test results. Samples are sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing when the patient meets certain criteria, including showing respiratory symptoms and having traveled from China in the past two weeks. They also might qualify for testing if they have been in close contact with someone who has traveled and is sick. “The Maryland Department of Health is closely monitoring the rapidly changing situation with 2019 N-CoV, both in the U.S. and in China,” said Fran Phillips, the state’s deputy secretary of public health, in a statement. “As we learn more, Marylanders are encouraged to practice everyday actions to promote good health and to protect yourself and your loved ones from respiratory viruses like the coronavirus — wash your hands thoroughly, cover your cough and avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home from work or school if you’re not feeling well.” The department emphasized that there are no confirmed cases in the state of this new coronavirus, a family of pathogens that includes the common cold and other more serious viruses such as SARS and MERS. There are more than 8,600 cases of the new coronavirus, mostly in China where the outbreak began. More than 80 have died. The CDC has said that Americans remain at low risk for infection from the virus. There are five confirmed cases in the United States, all among travelers. They are in California, Washington, Illinois and Arizona. The state health department has been receiving calls from local health department for days, but no one until now had met the criteria to be tested. Jennifer Schneider, a deputy director for disease prevention and management in the Anne Arundel County Department of Health, said there has not been anyone in the county who met the criteria to be tested, but officials are prepared. She said there are protocols for local health departments, which are likely to get the calls from hospitals and doctors’ offices in their area when someone comes in with a suspected case. They coordinate with the state health department and the CDC to test the people. For now, all of the samples go to the CDC lab, but the CDC is working on a test that can be used locally, she said. She said the most important thing people can do now to protect themselves is to maintain good hygiene, including frequent hand washing and avoiding people who are coughing and sneezing, as well as staying home and calling for medical advice if they become sick and are concerned. She also advised people to get a flu shot if they have not already. The influenza virus is not a coronavirus but is sickening far more Marylanders and Americans now. “The health risks from the coronavirus are low at this time,” she said. “The biggest threat at this time is the flu.”

Maryland legislature moves to speed up passage of ‘critical’ bills as coronavirus spreads
.W
Maryland lawmakers said Thursday they will work through the weekend and prioritize the most “critical” bills for passage in case they need to end the 441st Legislative Session early due to the spread of the coronavirus. In a joint statement, House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson said they asked their leadership teams to “finish critical bills in an expedited fashion.” “We will work through the weekend in session ― including floor sessions for the House and the Senate on Sunday, March 15, 2020,” Jones and Ferguson wrote. “Amendment requests will be taken by email only.” Public access to the legislature’s sessions would be limited to “only allow those persons with a state-issued badge into the building,” they wrote. Tours are canceled, as are rallies and receptions. The legislative leaders also limited public participation in bill hearings. Beginning next week, all bill hearings will feature in-person testimony only from the bill’s sponsor. Members of the public are encouraged to submit written testimony, instead of coming in person. During remarks from the House dais Thursday, Jones cautioned lawmakers to take steps to keep themselves healthy as the virus spreads. "I am asking and encouraging all of you to limit your attendance at gatherings like community meetings, receptions, etc., when you are back at home for the remainder of the legislative session out of an abundance of caution,” said Jones, a Baltimore County Democrat. “This is a time of great angst and anxiety,” Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, told his members. “These changes are intended to be precautionary measures.” Ferguson also asked senators to limit their engagement in large events. “We have to be the leaders of the community that model the best behavior,” he said. Major work of the legislature remains unfinished with less than a month to go until the scheduled end of the session on April 6. Only the Senate has passed Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s $47.9 billion budget, which includes $10 million to fight the spread of the coronavirus. And only the House has passed the two major pieces of legislation addressing public schools. The House overwhelmingly approved legislation to boost funding of school construction projects across the state by $2.2 billion. It also passed a $4 billion annual school improvement plan from the so-called Kirwan Commission that would expand prekindergarten to more students; increase teacher salaries and prove more vocational training programs in high schools. Both chambers must pass a bill for it to advance to Hogan’s desk for his consideration. Other unfinished business in the legislature includes a $389 million plan to overhaul the Pimlico and Laurel Park thoroughbred horse racing tracks, a measure to legalize and tax sports betting, and a package of tax bills aimed at raising revenue to implement the Kirwan recommendations. As the coronavirus spreads in the state, lawmakers, lobbyists and visitors in the state capital have largely stopped shaking hands — as difficult as that can be for people in the world of politics — preferring instead to do fist bumps. Hand sanitizer stations have been installed throughout the State House complex, and people are regularly encouraged to wash their hands well. Anne Arundel County’s House delegation canceled the remainder of its Friday morning meetings as a precaution, and Baltimore County’s House delegation canceled a meeting it planned for Friday. Jones and Ferguson sought to assure the public that restrictions on access to the State House and legislature would be temporary. “The good news is that this is not permanent,” they wrote. “The more proactive measures we take now, the better Maryland will fare over the weeks to come.” Baltimore Sun Media reporter Olivia Sanchez contributed to this article.

Havre de Grace company using high-tech solutions to disinfect facilities from coronavirus
.W
Robert Albrecht and his employees at Infection Prevention Systems LLC have been booked solid in recent weeks with clients who want their facilities disinfected to protect the occupants from the novel coronavirus. “They’re thinking about it now, they want that service now," Albrecht, president and founder of the Havre de Grace-based firm, said Wednesday. Infection Prevention Systems, which Albrecht founded in 2014, provides an array of services to clients who want their medical or surgical facilities, commercial properties or residences disinfected, or want to have places evaluated for cleanliness and a protocol developed to prevent any transfer of infection. The company is a tenant of The GroundFloor, Harford County’s business incubator off of Route 40 in Havre de Grace. Disinfection services were provided on an intermittent basis before global coronavirus pandemic cases showed up in Maryland in early March. Albrecht said most clients sought evaluations, or education and training in keeping facilities clean and hygienic, before the pandemic. “Now we are booked, booked solid” with requests to disinfect sites, such as commercial buildings where an employee has been sick and the facility operator wants to ensure coronavirus is not transmitted to the rest of the workforce, or sites where a number of visitors are expected, according to Albrecht. The company currently has a workforce of five, including Albrecht, but he is working to double its size. One location that received a recent pre-emptive cleaning was Independent Brewing Co. in Bel Air. The taproom of the craft brewery was disinfected last Friday using a Xenex robot that can bathe a section up to 40 feet in diameter in pulses of ultra-violet light. “In the taproom we have constant people, [an] ebb and flow of people, and really no way to do a comprehensive overall cleaning,” brewery owner Phillip Rhudy said. Bars and restaurants, as well as taprooms, throughout Maryland are not open to sit-down customers, in accordance with one of many orders from Gov. Larry Hogan curtailing interaction between people to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. People can visit those places for carry-out orders, though — patrons of local craft breweries have been able to pick up beer in to-go receptacles or get their growlers and crowlers filled. “We still are open for carryout business, so we wanted to protect our customers as well as our staff,” said Rhudy, who noted that “we get a good flow of people” in the taproom. Many people are staying home to avoid contact with others, or care for their children while schools statewide are closed through late April. “I would consider beer part of the staples of being hunkered down,” Rhudy joked. Rhudy said he learned about Infection Prevention Systems through a business partner, Harry O’Neill, who is friends with the company operators. “It’s basically a strobe system that directs intensified UV-C light in all directions,” Albrecht said while describing the Xenex unit, which is made by Xenex Disinfection Systems of San Antonio. Albrecht’s company has acquired three of the units, all of which had been previously used by the federal Veterans Affairs system. The second and third Xenex units were obtained in the past 30 days, he said. The robots are one of many products his company uses for disinfecting facilities. More information is available at the company website, ips-clean.com. The Xenex is most effective in an area that is free of debris or other objects. Albrecht described, during the demonstration, using the robot in a medical-surgical unit by moving the beds out of the room, then “blast” the room with the UV light, hit the beds from one site with the light, turn them around and hit the other side, and finally put the beds back in the room. The machine operator spends 10 to 15 minutes disinfecting a room, depending on its size, he said. Albrecht said Wednesday that the Xenex also has been used in medical facilities such as operating rooms, catheterization labs, offices, even control rooms at radio and TV stations. His company’s services also can be used in homes where residents want to prepare their dwellings for a person who is immuno-compromised. “We’ve taken this [service] from the health care industry, and we’ve moved it out into the private sector,” he said.

Once at risk of losing food stamps, 15,000 Baltimore residents get relief from coronavirus bill
.W
Two months ago, roughly 15,000 people in Baltimore were steeling themselves for a new Trump administration rule that would’ve slashed their food stamp benefits. Much has changed in the weeks since, as life across the globe is upended by the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic. Amid so much bad news, some relief is coming for those thousands of Baltimore residents who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. As part of federal coronavirus-related legislation, federal lawmakers last week suspended a rule that would’ve made it harder for able-bodied adults without dependents to maintain their food stamp benefits. “The 15,000 will continue with benefits as it has always been for them,” said Baltimore food policy director Holly Freishtat. The Trump administration’s change would have meant that adults between 18 to 49 years old who work less than 20 hours a week and have no dependents would have their food stamp benefits cut to just three months during a three-year period. Initially set to go into effect Wednesday, the rule is also is also facing a challenge in court. The policy was, in the words of U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, an attempt to move people “from welfare to work.” But many in Baltimore face barriers to employment, including addiction, health problems and criminal records. Some are seasonally employed or underemployed, so they don’t meet the requirement of 20 hours per week. The current public health crisis exacerbates these underlying problems. “These are the kinds of safety nets that people need,” said Del. Maggie McIntosh, a Baltimore Democrat. The rule suspension applies until after the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration is lifted. McIntosh said it must be permanent. “When we get through this,” she said of the pandemic, “if we don’t move to understanding that health care and food access should be a right in this country, then I don’t know what would move us.” Maryland has taken other steps to ensure broader food access while residents struggle with the widespread impact of this disease. The state Department of Human Services received a waiver allowing it to issue six-month extensions for food stamp certification to those whose benefits were scheduled to expire in March, April and May.

University of Maryland, Towson University cancel spring-break, summer study-abroad programs amid coronavirus concerns
.W
The University of Maryland, College Park and Towson University announced Tuesday that they’re canceling all spring-break and summer study-abroad programs because of coronavirus. The universities said the decision comes after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. Programs in Italy were suspended last week at both universities, as have studies in China. Maryland also suspended South Korea programs. Students returning to the United States from countries on the CDC’s COVID 19 transmission list are being asked to stay home rather than return to campus. They are also being asked to “self-monitor” and “self-isolate” for two weeks. That means staying home and checking for symptoms. Students abroad with a chronic health problem or those who are immunocompromised are also urged to return home, the University of Maryland release said. “I must emphasize the importance of not returning to campus and refraining from non-essential contact with others during the two-week self-isolation period,” Provost and Senior Vice President Mary Ann Rankin wrote in the email. “Members of the campus community may want to visit friends on campus, but we insist that travelers from Level 3 countries avoid doing so for 14 days. We all need to work together to limit the possible spread of this infection.” Those studying in Japan, which is at Alert Level 2 for coronavirus, are not yet being summoned back to the states. Maryland health officials are testing seven people for the new coronavirus this week. There continue to be no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Maryland, as results for six others with serious respiratory symptoms have come back negative, state officials reported. CDC officials said Tuesday that they believe the greatest risk is to people who have traveled and those who are in close contact with them, such as their family, as well as health care workers caring for the infected. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing, though most people suffer only mild cases and don’t always know they are infected. About 16% suffer more severe symptoms and need hospitalization, according to the CDC. Scientists estimate the infection kills fewer than 1% of those infected.

Women of the World Festival in Baltimore canceled over coronavirus concerns
.W
The Women of the World (WOW) Festival, which was expected to bring more than 1,000 attendees to Baltimore this weekend, has been canceled amid “growing concerns and uncertainty” about the coronavirus. The festival, which had been scheduled to take place Saturday at the Columbus Center in the Inner Harbor, was expected to draw attendees from across the country, said organizers who added they decided to call off the festival “to side with safety and mitigate potential further spread.” “It was a difficult decision, but participant safety has to come first," the festival said in a statement on its website. “Although, as of this morning (Thursday), there have not been any confirmed cases in Maryland, we believe, because of Baltimore’s positioning just north of Washington, D.C. and south of large cities such as New York and Philadelphia, it would be prudent to side with safety and mitigate potential further spread among the more than 1,000 expected attendees – with some traveling from across the nation." On Thursday night, Maryland health officials confirmed the state’s first three cases of coronavirus, the respiratory disease that has sickened about 100,000 across the globe and killed more than 3,000. Eleven people have died from the coronavirus in the United States, 10 of them in Washington state. The festival is part of a “global movement that celebrates women and girls as a force for positive change,” its website says. One of more than a dozen WOW Festival sites around the world, Baltimore’s forum is designed to “inspire, engage and energize women and men in the Baltimore region by providing diverse forums for discussion and action to advance positive transformation for Baltimore and beyond,” the website says. The WOW movement was founded in 2010 by Jude Kelly, the artistic director of London’s Southbank Centre complex, to mark the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day, to celebrate women and girls and recognize the obstacles they face, and to “create a festival for everyone.” “It is bold and broad-based in its approach, both lively and serious, and feeds the demand to discuss anything and everything,” the website says. “It brings people together from all corners of society – both speakers and audience members – energizing and providing the inspiration and tools to make change.” WOW Festival organizers have not yet said whether it will be rescheduled, but attendees will be refunded in the next five to seven business days.

Laurel resident’s internship in Carroll County takes a turn during coronavirus pandemic
.W
When Rabiatu Abdul Salam, a junior at McDaniel College, signed up for a nonprofit organization’s writing class, she knew she would gain valuable experience working in the community. What the Laurel resident did not expect was that most of her experience would be spent at home. “She is a working on a totally different project than when she began,” said Johanna Veader, outreach specialist at Rape Crisis Intervention Service of Carroll County, where Abdul Salam chose to volunteer. “She’s taken a lot of initiative. We are lucky to partner with her.” The center has had interns from the college in different capacities throughout the years, Veader said. As an intern with the Rape Crisis Center, Abdul Salam was creating a video showcasing the center and its services. When the coronavirus pandemic shut down the campus and forced classes online, Abdul Salam was no longer allowed to attend the center. “I had to switch my project around,” Abdul Salam said. “Now, I am working on creating blog posts for them.” Abdul Salam became familiar with the Rape Crisis Center during her first year at McDaniel while doing a project for another class. “I always admired what they did,” Abdul Salam said of the nonprofit’s mission to provide free counseling and support services to victims of sexual violence. “I thought it would be a perfect fit for me.” Offered for almost a decade, the course strengthens the college’s relationship with the Westminster community and gives students firsthand experience, according to Joshua Ambrose, associate dean of Campus and Community Engagement. Students have also interned at Carroll Lutheran Village, the Boys and Girls Club and the Civil Air Patrol. “The challenges now have been around helping our nonprofits transition to remote work and run their internships online,” Ambrose said in an email. “Thankfully, they’ve all stepped up to the challenge!” Rape Crisis Intervention Service still offers its 24-hour hotline and therapists are conducting therapy over the phone. The nonprofit’s popular fundraiser, A Mile in Her Shoes, was held but moved online, with participants sending in videos of their walks and Abdul Salam creating blogs about it. “There are tons of ways to help with fundraisers,” Abdul Salam said. “A big part has been processing fundraiser ideas to raise money for the programs." A political science major, Abdul Salam plans to go to law school when she graduates. “Maybe I’ll start my own nonprofit,” Abdul Salam said. "I like the idea of helping in some way.” “Rabie is a wonderful student and very passionate about the mission of RCIS,” Ambrose wrote in an email. “She is doing a fine job of emailing/connecting with our partners at the organization and is dedicated to helping them in whatever way she can. She is also a good writer, with wonderful ambitions towards international service in the years to come.”

Howard police urging residents to use online, phone reporting system amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Howard County Police Department is encouraging residents to use its online and phone reporting system as the new coronavirus continues to spread in the region and across the country. The measure is being taken to limit police officers’ exposure to the coronavirus, the department said Tuesday. Residents can call 410-313-2200 to submit a report by phone or online at tinyurl.com/HCPDREPORTS. If the report is an emergency, residents are urged to still call 911. Residents can utilize the reporting system for incidents if the following are true: it’s not an emergency, there are no known suspects or witnesses, there’s no evidence to collect, it’s not a hate or bias crime, the incident is not currently in progress and the incident occurred more than 30 minutes ago. The following incidents can be reported online or by phone: Animal complaints  Theft from a shed or detached garage  Destruction of property under $1,000  Theft under $5,000  Lost property  Harassing phone call  Tampering with vehicles  Theft from vehicle  Unauthorized use of a vehicle  Identity theft  Solicitor complaint

Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages people wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus also known by the disease it causes, COVID-19. Because of the critical demand for surgical masks and N95 respirators for health care workers and first responders, the CDC has recommended that cloth face coverings for the general public be fashioned from household items such as T-shirts, bandannas, tea towels or other common materials. We want to see what you are using to cover your face. Snap a selfie of yourself wearing your homemade mask or face covering, and send it to cctnews@carrollcountytimes.com along with your name and where you live, and we may use it in a photo gallery or upcoming edition of the Carroll County Times.

Maryland’s small farmers deal with the early economic impact of coronavirus
.W
The tulips are starting to bloom, thousands of them, in wild colors ranging from brilliant orange to pink and burgundy. In normal years the flowers grown at Two Boots Farm in Hampstead would make bouquets for weddings and for restaurant tables, or be sold in bunches at farmers markets. But weddings and other events have been cancelled en mass in the wake of a global coronavirus pandemic. Restaurants are closed, with government officials advising against close contact between people. The opening date for the Baltimore Farmers’ Market & Bazaar, the city’s largest farmers market, has been postponed indefinitely. “Basically all my sales outlets,” said farmer Elisa Lane, owner of Two Boots Farm, which operates a stand at the Farmers’ Market & Bazaar, also known as the JFX market, each year. She and other farmers are scrambling to overhaul their business models in a time of pandemic, exploring ways to sell to individual consumers and in some cases, rethinking what they should grow. It’s just one way the coronavirus pandemic is expected to disrupt agriculture — a $3 billion industry in Maryland alone. “The coronavirus will impact the entire agriculture industry large and small," says Benjamin Beale, who works with farmers as an educator with University of Maryland Extension in St. Mary’s County. “How much? I think it’s still up in the air right now.” He pointed to commodity markets for corn, soy beans, wheat and barley, where prices have taken a substantial hit over the last month and a half. “I think its fair to say that all farmers are very nervous right now about where all markets are heading." Until this week, restaurant sales made up about 90% of the business at Chesapeake Farm to Table, a cooperative made up of approximately 25 farmers in the region, including some in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The group’s client list reads like a hot list of Baltimore’s best restaurants: Clavel, Ida B’s Table and Woodberry Kitchen, to name a few. Since the restaurant shutdown, Beckie Gurley, who runs the cooperative with her husband, has spent hours on the phone with her software company to tweak the group’s website to accept more orders from individual consumers. “In a day we had to switch gears — from the restaurant to the home customer." She also owns Calvert’s Gift Farms, a certified organic farm in Sparks. “We doubled our orders this week from last week... and it’s to a completely different customer type.” “Do I have any hair left? The answer is no,” Gurley said Wednesday. A few Baltimore restaurants such as Well Crafted Kitchen in Medfield have agreed to become designated pickup spots for produce, an approach that allows individuals to place orders without abiding by a $75 minimum Gurley usually requires for free delivery. So far, so good. “This week, home sales have made up for my restaurant losses,” she said Thursday in between deliveries, dropping off sausage, mushrooms, eggs, artichokes, and “cheese, cheese, cheese, oh my God, cheese.” At Christy Ottinger’s Kitchen Girl Farm near Cockeysville, orders for fresh eggs have been trending downward for weeks as restaurant owners braced for a decline in business. But her 600 chickens didn’t stop laying — about one per day. Ottinger, who also works with Chesapeake Farm to Table, is using the restaurants that once bought her eggs to sell her produce. Customers picking up carryout at Clavel, Noona’s and Well Crafted Kitchen can pick up a dozen fresh eggs, faint blue and speckled brown, with their orders. On Wednesday, the nonprofit Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts announced that they were postponing the opening date for the Baltimore Farmers’ Market & Bazaar, originally scheduled for April 5, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The market usually takes place on Sundays beneath the JFX in Downtown Baltimore. With 5,000 visitors during normal times, the market walks “the line between being an event and being a food hub,” said Tracy Baskerville, communications director for BOPA. Many come to socialize as much as to grocery shop. Whether to close farmers markets or to keep them open as a food source has been a issue across the country as officials balance concerns about food access with the need for social distancing. In Los Angeles, officials have allowed outdoor markets to continue, with certain restrictions in place. A large farmers market in Houston is slated to continue in the city. The Maryland Department of Agriculture issued a statement Thursday requesting that farmers markets be allowed to remain open during the state of emergency, since they play a “critical role" in providing food to people, especially those who live in food deserts or rely on SNAP benefits. BOPA’s decision didn’t sit well with Gurley. “It’s unfair to the small producers that rely on farmers markets," Gurley said. “I am just as important as a food purveyor as the Giant is." At farmers markets that do remain open, like one in Takoma Park, Gurley plans to take safety measures including keeping produce in bags and having one person handle money and another handle food. In Baltimore, the 32nd Street Farmers Market continues to operate, according to the group’s website. A few others, like ones in Druid Hill and Govanstown, don’t begin until June. Still, Baskerville hopes that as the season progresses — and more produce starts coming in at area farms — the market beneath the JFX will find a way to open. "We are also being optimistic,” she said. “We haven’t cancelled the market for this season at all.” Being early in the season also allows farmers time to rethink their growing plans. Smaller farmers may be able to adapt more easily to changes in the market. Lane, who typically specializes in flowers is pivoting her growing strategy to focus on produce that she thinks will be needed more in times of isolation, rather than flowers. That approach wouldn’t be feasible for a larger farmer, said Beale. He recently spoke to another wholesale flower grower on the Eastern Shore who supplies blooms for weddings and other events: “His business over the last two weeks has just disappeared.” Another blow for farms is likely to come in the form of a labor shortage, says Patty Lovera, policy director for the Organic Farmers Association. The U.S. State Department of State has suspended visa processing in Mexico because of the pandemic, and American farmers are bracing for a massive labor shortage. “The food system runs on immigrant labor,” Lovera said. Some small farmers on the Eastern Shore have actually seen a growth in business in recent weeks, with grocery stores pillaged and consumers looking to buy local meats and cheeses. Chesapeake Bay Farms in Pocomoke, Maryland is four miles from a major highway, “the middle of nowhere,” says owner Laura Holland. But in recent days and weeks they’ve had so many individual visitors coming by to purchase bottled milk, butter and cheese that Holland decided to open their rural shop nearly a month early to meet the increased demand. They’ve also seen a huge growth in home delivery orders — a combination of people looking to avoid the mayhem of supermarkets and existing customers who are quarantined at home. Holland hopes the increased business will offset the drop in restaurant sales. “One thing goes down, the other takes off,” she said. She and other farmers interviewed expressed hope that the shortages wrought by the coronavirus crisis will encourage more people to think locally about their food. “One thing this coronavirus has done is made people stop and look at where my food comes from,” Holland said. Gurley echoed that sentiment: “People are running to the local food movement and this is what we have been preaching for years."

Judge in Baltimore rules against small businesses in federal coronavirus-relief lawsuit against Bank of America
.W
A federal judge in Baltimore has ruled against small businesses in a coronavirus-relief lawsuit. Baltimore-based Profiles filed a class-action lawsuit April 3 against Bank of America on behalf of small businesses that say the bank blocked them from applying to the federal Paycheck Protection Program. The bank is an authorized lender in the $349 billion program that offers federally backed loans of up to $10 million to employers with fewer than 500 workers to help with payroll and other expenses during the pandemic. In a written ruling Monday, Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher denied the plaintiffs’ request to stop the bank from imposing application restrictions. The businesses argued that restricting applicants that did not have a borrowing relationship with the bank was not permitted under the federal emergency legislation. “The Court is certainly sympathetic to the economic harm that plaintiffs’ respective small businesses are enduring,” Gallagher wrote. “COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on this country, and the global economy... BofA’s rigid eligibility criteria have undoubtedly made it materially harder for some small businesses to access the PPP.” But she found the CARES law does not allow for private parties to bring a lawsuit, saying “nothing in its text evidences Congress’s intent to enable PPP loan applicants to bring civil suits against PPP lenders, to enforce that right." And she said the bank’s “conduct here does not run afoul of the CARES Act,” which does not prohibit banks from considering other information when deciding whether to accept applications or in what order to process them. Granting the plaintiffs’ request could “disincentive lenders from participating in the program altogether.” Plaintiffs attorney Alan M. Rifkin said the plaintiffs will appeal and “continue to press their right to seek these critical funds.” “The class action highlights serious shortcomings in Bank of America’s administering of the program which, by application, denied scores of small businesses throughout the country the right to access these critical funds at a time when those funds are desperately needed,” Rifkin said Monday. Plaintiffs are calling on Congress, the bank and other lenders authorized to distribute funds to remove restrictions for small businesses that otherwise qualify for the loans. Responding to the judge’s ruling, a spokesman said the bank remains focused on processing the more than 300,000 applications received so far, seeking more than $45 billion in loans. Separately, Baltimore-based Howard Bank said Monday it has made 516 loans through the Paycheck Protection Program totaling $139 million since the program opened a week ago. The commercial bank has become the Baltimore district market’s top lender in the number of such loans and No. 3 lender in total dollars, according to the Small Business Administration. The SBA said 4,692 loans totaling about $1.5 billion have been made in the Baltimore district. “Whether they are borrowers, depositors or both we are focused on making sure our customers have the funds and support they need to keep their businesses operating during this crisis," said Mary Ann Scully, the bank’s chairman and CEO, in a statement.

Morgan State moves to online classes for rest of semester, vacates campus amid coronavirus
.W
Morgan State University has mandated that all student leave campus and that classes be taken virtually for the rest of the semester as the college becomes the latest to close its doors in response to the growing coronavirus outbreak. In an announcement Tuesday, university President David K. Wilson wrote that all students currently on campus “should begin making arrangements with their families/guardians to move out of the residence halls and return home for the remainder of the semester.” Students already away from campus on spring break are being asked not to return to campus. Those “for whom relocation to home would cause extreme hardship, and those who are facing other special circumstances” can request to stay at the college, Wilson said. “Given the State’s executive order to temporarily shutter businesses, gathering places and entertainment venues off-campus, and the call to minimize large gatherings of people on-campus, it has become evident that this is the best action to take to enhance the safety of our students,” Wilson wrote. The university is extending its two-week interim period of virtual classes until the end of the semester and has “implemented temporary telework guidelines for all non-essential staff who are approved to telework.” Spring commencement, which is usually held in May, is postponed until a later date to be determined, Wilson wrote. The Division of Student Affairs will handle requests to stay on campus on a case-by-case basis. Those affected by the closure of on-campus housing “will be issued pro-rated refunds for unused housing and meal plan fees,” the president wrote. “Please know that these decisions were made with thoughtful consideration of the needs of our students, particularly as it relates to graduation,” Wilson wrote. Morgan State becomes the latest Maryland college to close its doors in response to the growing outbreak of COVID-19, more commonly known as the coronavirus. At least 57 people have confirmed COVID-19 infections in the state as of Tuesday. Colleges in the University System of Maryland, of which Morgan State is not a part, have told students not to return to campus following spring break and plan to have classes taught online at least until April.

Howard Community College men’s basketball team withdraws from national tournament amid coronavirus concerns
.W
On Wednesday afternoon, just three days after winning the Region 20 tournament to advance to the National Junior College Athletic Association DII National Tournament for only the second time in program history, the Howard Community College men’s basketball team was informed that it will not be allowed to participate because of concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Howard CC has suspended all athletic team out-of-state travel until further notice, which includes the basketball team’s upcoming trip to Danville, Illinois for the national tournament. The Dragons were scheduled to leave via bus on Saturday. Members of the team and coaching staff were brought together and addressed by Howard CC Vice President of Student Services Cindy Peterka immediately after practice on Wednesday and made aware of the decision. Shortly after, just before 7 p.m., an email was sent out to all members of the Howard Community College community providing an update on the college’s operations, travel restrictions and opportunities for support in relation to the novel coronavirus disease. The same information was posted on the school’s website. “Howard Community College has been closely monitoring the rapidly evolving situation with the coronavirus. Every hour brings new information to carefully consider,” said Elizabeth Homan, Executive Director of Public Relations and Marketing for Howard CC. “Out-of-state travel had already been suspended by the county, state, and some of our own peer community colleges in Maryland. We made the decision to suspend all out-of-state travel out of an abundance of caution, and after considering CDC and health department guidelines, and local, state, and national news.” Homan added that the travel regulations extend beyond just athletics. “The out-of-state travel suspension is for all students and employees. In addition to athletics travel, we canceled an alternative spring break trip within the United States, spring break and summer study abroad trips, and other out-of-state student trips planned for this month,” she said. “We have to look at the health and wellness of the entire community." Howard CC defeated CCBC Dundalk for the Region 20 tournament title on Sunday by a score of 104-85, securing the automatic bid into the national tournament. The team then found out on Tuesday that it would be the eighth seed in the 16-team field and face ninth-seeded North Central Missouri in the opening round on Tuesday, March 17. Just over 24 hours later, however, the team was made aware that it would not be allowed to make the trip. As of Wednesday evening, all 15 other teams in the NJCAA DII field were still scheduled to participate. Homan said the decision was not an easy one. “We came to this decision after much deliberation, and we understand how difficult and emotional this news is for our student-athletes and their families,” she said. “We had to make difficult decisions that we believe are in the best, long-term interest of students, faculty, staff, and the Howard County community.” On Thursday afternoon, the NJCAA announced that the DII tournament was postponed.

Maryland legislature passes bill to extend temporary unemployment benefits during coronavirus pandemic
.W
On the final day of a shortened legislative session, Maryland’s lawmakers passed emergency legislation Wednesday to extend unemployment benefits to people who lose their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. The legislation allows the state to extend temporary unemployment benefits to workers who have to be quarantined or whose employers temporarily close. The legislation also makes people eligible for benefits when they have to leave their jobs due to risk of exposure or to care for an infected relative. The Senate’s version of the legislation was sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson and Sen. Clarence Lam, a Howard County Democrat and physician. A House of Delegates version of the bill was sponsored by Speaker Adrienne A. Jones. The bill takes a number of other steps to address the pandemic’s impact in Maryland. It would cut costs for screening tests, improve access to telehealth services, prohibit price gouging and make it illegal for an employer to fire a worker because he or she is quarantined. Lawmakers and Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said the legislation was badly needed after Hogan ordered bars, sit-down restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to close Monday. The legislation now advances to Hogan’s desk for his expected signature. It will become law as soon as it is signed.

Baltimore Police finalizing ‘contingency’ staffing plan as 19 employees test positive for coronavirus 
.W
Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the department is prepared to handle potential officer shortages even as 19 employees, including 16 officers, tested positive for the new coronavirus, and 63 others remain quarantined due to possible exposure. Baltimore Police are in the process of finalizing a “contingency plan” for how it will operate if the coronaviruscauses severe staffing shortages, Harrison said at a Thursday afternoon news conference. The department has about 2,500 sworn officers, well below its optimum levels, Harrison has said. “We are prepared to reallocate human resources and move officers around to make sure the entire city is covered,” he said. “Right now, we’re not experiencing a significant shortage. All the platoons are covered on every shift, every day.” Harrison said that if more than 15% of the force is out sick or quarantined, “we can start moving people around and pulling people out of specialized units and reallocating resources.” A total of 315 employees have been quarantined due to potential exposure to the virus since the beginning of the outbreak last month. The department said in a statement Thursday that 252 of them have been cleared to return to work. Baltimore Police, like agencies around the country, have instituted new protocols to reduce officers’ exposure and potentially avoid depleting its ranks. Patrol officers now start their shifts at roll calls outside the district station building. They are required to “complete daily health checks and remain alert for any respiratory symptoms" police spokeswoman Lindsey Eldridge said. “This includes checking their temperature twice a day.” Many of the department’s facilities, including the district station houses, are closed to the public. At shooting scenes, officers can be seen wearing face masks. As it did before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Baltimore Police department partners with other local and state law enforcement agencies, Eldridge said “The department continues to leverage and reassign different units within the department to ensure no disruption in public safety services throughout the city,” she said. Eldridge declined to provide additional details about the department’s contingency plan, including providing an estimate of how many officers it would be able to lose and still provide expected service. On Saturday, the department briefly closed the entire Southwest District station house after an officer tested positive for the COVID-19 illness. Initially, department officials said all personnel assigned to the district would be tested, but later said only some officers would be tested. Officers who didn’t show symptoms, or who didn’t come into the building, were evaluated by health partners, and might not have required a test, Eldridge said previously. On Wednesday, the department confirmed that a detective assigned to the Northeastern District tested positive for the coronavirus, but did not announce that the facility would be shuttered. Eldridge said the detective already had been off duty for a week while awaiting the test results and that the department was following the recommendations of health officials. In New York City, the center of the pandemic in the U.S., one out of six officers is calling out of work for either a confirmed case or potential exposure. In Detroit, another city hit hard by the spreading illness, 14% of the force’s 2,500 officers are quarantined. The police chief there moved 80 officers from special units to patrol work, according to a report by The Detroit News. In Washington, D.C., where 36 officers have tested positive for COVID-19 and hundreds have called out of work, officials say the department is prepared to lose many more members before hitting a “diminishment of service,” according to a recent Washington Post article. At a news conference Tuesday discussing a shooting by three police officers of an armed man in East Baltimore, Harrison noted that the city continues to be pummeled by violence despite the statewide stay-at-home orders, though other crimes and calls for service have seen declines in the city. “Even amidst a pandemic, the culture of violence is still very pervasive, and people are still trying to solve their conflicts with gun violence," Harrison said.

Analyst report: Under Armour’s turnaround faces “significant” setback from coronavirus outbreak
.W
Under Armour faces a “significant” setback in its turnaround effort because of disruptions caused by the new coronavirus outbreak, an analyst said Friday. “COVID-19 disruption has been abrupt and significant," Jim Duffy, an analyst with Stifel, wrote in a report released Friday. "Store closures in both domestic and overseas markets have disrupted the spring selling season and produced inventory imbalances. “Additionally, school cancellations, job losses and social distancing measures are altering behavioral patterns,” he said. Stifel and other experts had applauded the Baltimore-based brand’s plan to turn around sluggish U.S. sales, but “the growing list of near-term risks puts our optimism for shares on the bench for the remainder of 2020,” the report said. Stifel downgraded the Baltimore-based brand’s shares to hold and cut its 12-month target on stock price from $16 per share to $11 each. Under Armour shares, which had been trading over $20 a share in January and early February, have fallen since and closed Friday at $9.44 each. The Stifel analysts said they remain bullish on the sports apparel maker’s long-term prospects and new leadership under CEO Patrik Frisk, who took over in January to replace founder Kevin Plank. Plank has stayed on as executive chairman and brand chief. Once the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the brand’s momentum will hinge on stabilization in the sports apparel channel, re-balancing inventory levels and seeing “tangible evidence” of consumer appetite for new styles. Under Armour had closed all 188 of its North American stores from March 16 through Saturday, calling the shutdown a precautionary measure to help stem the spread of the virus. Since Under Armour first closed its stores, most major U.S. retail chains also have shut down and have continued business online. Its website now says stores will be closed until further notice. On Thursday, Under Armour said it has borrowed $700 million through an existing line of credit to prepare for the effects of the pandemic on its sales. The company said it borrowed the funds “as a precautionary measure in order to increase its cash position and preserve liquidity given the uncertainty in global markets resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.” Under Armour faces not only lost sales from store closures, but lost brand exposure because organized sports have been canceled, Stifel said. “We are all hoping umps can say “play ball” soon, but cancellation of organized sports removes a key showcase for marketing assets such as the sponsored teams who won’t get to play in the NCAA tournament and [baseball] athletes like Bryce Harper and Christian Yelich," he said. Additionally, the cancellation of school and youth sports is expected to hurt demand both for Under Armour and retailers that carry its products, he said. Inventory imbalances, meanwhile, could last into next year, hurting profit margins, while excess inventory at larger rivals, such as Nike, could crowd smaller players out of the marketplace, Stifel’s report said. In its favor, Under Armour has cash on hand, additional borrowing capacity and strong banking relationships, Stifel said. “We expect Under Armour to navigate these challenges and regroup in 2021," the report said.

Maryland lawmakers consider ending legislative session early, advance emergency bill to fight coronavirus
.W
Maryland lawmakers said Friday they are considering ending the legislative session early if the spread of coronavirus forces that decision. “We could leave on Sine Die. We could recess," said Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat. Ferguson said he is monitoring the situation “day by day.” Ferguson and Republican Sen. J.B. Jennings, the Senate minority leader, said that if lawmakers have to end the session early, a special session might be necessary later to pass additional legislation. “Let’s get the budget passed,” Jennings told fellow senators Friday. Democrats are pushing forward with the session in hopes of passing a plethora of legislation, including three major school funding proposals: A $4 billion annual plan to overhaul the state’s public schools; a $2.2 billion school construction funding boost; and a $580 million increase to historically black colleges and universities. Gov. Larry Hogan urged lawmakers Friday night to expedite certain actions by Tuesday, in the event that the legislature has to adjourn early. He called on them to pass the state budget, approve a bill that addresses the impact of the virus and confirm Col. Woodrow J. Jones, whom he nominated to be superintendent of the Maryland State Police. “It is impossible at this time to know how long this public health emergency will continue, and it is critical for legislators to take these actions immediately,” Hogan, a Republican, tweeted. The Senate acceded to one of the governor’s wishes and quickly held a confirmation hearing and unanimous vote Friday night for the state police superintendent. Such high-ranking appointees usually are required to appear in person, but Ferguson said this was an extenuating circumstance because Jones is leading his troopers during the public health crisis. “It is important that the nominee be confirmed so the individual can act in an official capacity,” he said. Ferguson also said he was disappointed with the governor’s tweet, but allowed that “tempers can be high” in moments like this. “Now, more than ever, we need to find ways to work together," the Senate president said. House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones responded to the governor with a tweet saying the legislature has been working with Hogan and is prioritizing the budget and other key bills. “Please don’t degrade our collaborative work to Twitter bombs in this time of uncertainty,” the Baltimore County Democrat wrote. “Let’s continue to work together for all MDers.” Jones and Ferguson said that for the remainder of the session, lobbyists and advocates will not be permitted in the State House complex unless they have an appointment. Jones told her members that “no one will be permitted to linger in the buildings.” She said delegates should only attend required meetings and emphasized that committee meetings are livestreamed on the General Assembly’s website. “This is an ever-evolving situation and I will continue to update you with information as I get it,” Jones told members at the close of the House’s first floor session of the day. “It is important to note that we are not closing, but operating under a modified status.” Meanwhile, dozens of organizations sent a letter Friday to legislative leaders, urging them to recess as soon as they pass the budget and public health bills. The groups, including government watchdog group Common Cause, the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote that the restricted access to the State House complex means lawmakers’ work isn’t being done in an open and transparent fashion. “The General Assembly is operating with limited public input from the public and advocates, and the legislative process is taking place without the full voice and input of the people of Maryland,” the groups wrote. The State House complex was eerily quiet Friday. The House office building is typically bustling on Friday mornings with lobbyists and activists angling to get a word with lawmakers and many local delegations holding public meetings. Those meetings were largely canceled. By afternoon, the office buildings were nearly deserted. Some committee voting sessions were conducted in nearly empty rooms. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee locked its doors to keep out everyone except credentialed journalists. Both the House and Senate moved ahead with floor sessions attended by almost all the legislators. The Senate gave preliminary approval to emergency legislation to reduce barriers to healthcare access amid the spread of the new coronavirus, if the governor declares a “catastrophic health emergency," which is separate from the state of emergency that’s already in effect. The House also, without debate, gave preliminary approval to its version of the bill. The bill would cut costs of screening tests, improve access to telehealth services, prohibit price gouging and ensure that people under quarantine cannot lose their jobs. “Every single segment of society will be touched by this pandemic,” said Howard County Democratic Sen. Clarence Lam, a doctor, and one of the bill sponsors.

Baltimore County closing senior centers, canceling recreation events as coronavirus spreads
.W
Baltimore County will close its senior centers next week and restrict recreation events, as it ramps up coronavirus response following the county’s first confirmed case Wednesday. County Executive Johnny Olszewski, Jr. said the county will add new protocols to screen for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, to protect first responders. The county is seeking emergency supplies of soap, hand sanitizer and other cleaning supplies. And the county is reviewing options for county employee sick leave and remote work. Nonessential out-of-state travel is canceled for county employees. “We knew it was only a matter of time before a case was confirmed in Baltimore county and we have been preparing for its arrival,” Olszewski said. “It is clear that we must take this threat seriously." Olszewski said the county wants to maintain the sanitation of senior centers, jails, courts and areas with “large traffic flows.” All senior centers will be closed to the public effective Monday, and Olszewski said events planned at those centers this week will be canceled. He urged seniors to work with county staff now to sort out how they can continue to receive services. Recreational facilities will remain open, but Olszewski said events managed by the county department of recreation and parks will be canceled. Likewise, the county is also advising the county recreation council to suspend their sporting events as well as their three remaining budget town halls. “All outdoor and indoor Baltimore County Recreation and Parks programming is cancelled until further notice,” the Towson Recreation Council said in an email sent to its subscriber list Thursday afternoon. “We will update you when we have more information.” Additionally, Olszewski said the county is suspending all currently scheduled meetings related to the county’s Comprehensive Zoning Map Process. He said the county is exploring “virtual options” for residents to share their input on the forthcoming budget and the zoning process. Olszewski is also urging organizations to postpone or cancel any planned large events. Dr. Gregory Branch, county health department director, said the county has been preparing since December for what’s now been deemed a pandemic. Branch said this won’t be Baltimore County’s last positive case, but he’s urging people to “be calm” and to wash their hands with soap and water to help prevent the spread as well as avoiding large crowds and staying at home if people are feeling ill. “Please please wash your hands frequently. These may seem to be small things but they have a major impact,” Branch said. The county has sent 20 COVID-19 tests to the CDC, Branch said, including the one that tested positive. Ten of those tests had negative results and the county is waiting for the results of the remaining tests. People with symptoms are advised to reach out to their primary care provider or the emergency room, and those experts will reach out to the county, Branch said. County schools superintendent Dr. Darryl Williams said the school system is postponing or cancelling all large assemblies. They’re taking a case by case approach to deciding which field trips to cancel. He said the school system will work with the state schools chief and the county health department to make any decisions about school closures.

Baltimore teams up with Goldman Sachs for loan program aimed at small businesses hit by coronavirus
.W
Baltimore small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic can apply for loans through a new partnership between the city and Goldman Sachs. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young joined business executives Tuesday to announce the plan, supported by federal coronavirus relief legislation and Goldman Sachs’ small business stimulus package. The $10 million program will help connect some of Baltimore’s more than 12,000 small businesses with potentially forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans. It’s designed to help businesses — including those without an existing banking relationship to depend on — get support in a time of severe economic uncertainty. “It is important that we help our small businesses stabilize, reopen, and return to operating at full capacity to get Baltimore City residents back to work and restart our local economy,” Young said. The program will follow guidelines established by the Small Business Administration, and target underserved businesses in particular. It will help businesses’ keep their employees on payroll and stay up-to-date with bills. Dominick Davis, who owns an apparel shop in Mount Vernon, said his revenue dropped to zero in March because of the coronavirus-related shutdowns. The shop has since switched up their business model, and DifferentRegard now produces protective masks and gowns. But his company’s future “remains unclear,” he said, as he questions when retail sales will return to normal. “Baltimore businesses need support now more than ever,” Davis said, adding that he’s excited to work on his loan application. Lendistry, which helps small businesses with financing, will begin accepting applications for the program immediately.

Baltimore unions told there could be pay cuts, furloughs and layoffs because of coronavirus budget shortfall
.W
Baltimore officials warned union leaders that their members could face pay cuts, furloughs and layoffs as the city braces for budget shortfalls amid the coronavirus pandemic. Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 President Sgt. Mike Mancuso wrote a fiery letter to members Thursday night, saying he and other union leaders met with city officials to discuss how to address a looming $103 million revenue shortfall for next year. Mancuso’s letter said the city is looking to make $11 million in personnel cuts. City spokesman Lester Davis acknowledged such cuts will be difficult, and said hard choices must be made as Baltimore faces “an economic downtown that we haven’t seen since the Great Recession." “The picture around revenue for the city is very bleak,” he said. “We’re going to have to figure that out.” Also at Thursday’s meeting were leaders from City Union of Baltimore, the Managerial and Professional Society of Baltimore, the firefighters’ union and the union that represents nurses, including some who are working at the city’s drive-thru coronavirus testing site at Pimlico Race Course. They were presented with a series of cost-cutting scenarios to consider; none are set in stone. Leaders were told the city could freeze members’ salaries, meaning they would forego raises unions won in collective bargaining, according to a city memo distributed to union presidents. The second option outlined in the memo would have city employees take up to six furlough days, with a 1.5% to 2.3% impact on their salaries. Lastly, the city offered a scenario in which there would be no pay freeze and no furloughs. But it would mean nearly 175 layoffs of full-time employees, the memo states, most of whom are deemed nonessential. Mancuso said the suggested cuts are asking too much from a police department grappling with continued high rates of violence even during the pandemic. The police union also warned of the risks facing officers and their families as they work in dangerous conditions. “I am furious and disgusted with the mayor and his administration for asking our members to shoulder the burden of this crisis both physically and now financially," Mancuso wrote in the two-page letter to the department’s 2,500 members. He said 350 department employees have been quarantined in connection with the outbreak, with 63 awaiting test results and 19 that have tested positive for COVID-19. Mancuso also noted that the city recently agreed to pay officers an additional $200 per paycheck as hazard pay, which he said city leaders are now trying to “recoup,” a move he called “deceitful and insulting.” “Now, we are being asked to sacrifice even more while we continue to put on our uniforms and place ourselves on the front lines of this pandemic for the citizens of Baltimore,” he said. The potential cuts come as the police department has worked to rebuild its ranks under a federal consent decree. In addition to attempting to hire 300 more officers, department leaders are trying to shift more work toward civilian employees to further free up officers for patrol and other functions. Richard “Dickie” Altieri II, president of Baltimore Fire Fighters, International Association of Fire Fighters Local 734, said he understands the city is facing economic challenges, but such discussions are premature. “This was not the time for the city to be discussing these issues, especially when we still have not hit the surge that is expected to hit late next week,” Altieri said in a letter to his union’s members, referring to an expected surge of COVID-19 cases as the disease becomes more widespread in the city. “We know that the city has to balance their budget with the mayor and City Council by July and that everyone is being hit hard by this global pandemic. But to suggest this sacrifice of our members, who are on the front lines every day, is unacceptable and disheartening.” Altieri also said the proposals were an insult to firefighters and others on the front lines of the pandemic. “Now is the time for all city unions to work together to be able to fully advocate for their members," he wrote. Wendy Smith, president of American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Council 67 & Local 558, which represents about 90 nurses who work for the city health department and school system, said it doesn’t make sense to lay off nurses during a pandemic. “They are out there risking their families’ lives, and to do this with less pay?” Smith added. “We are already in a position where we are so short.” That city employees are at the forefront of the pandemic is not lost on Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, Davis said. “We owe it those on the front lines to try to figure out a way to accomplish the financial goals that we need for the city in a way that’s going to be least impactful across the board,” Davis said. The economic uncertainty sparked by the pandemic is expected to have widespread and long-lasting effects on state and local government budgets. Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr., a Democrat, instituted a freeze Thursday on nonessential hiring. Carroll County’s budget director recently predicted the county could lose $4 million a month in revenues because of a statewide stay-at-home order meant to slow the spread of the disease. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan enacted a state budget freeze Friday. A worst-case scenario developed by the state comptroller’s office estimated Maryland could lose $2.8 billion in revenue by the end of June, should the stay-at-home order remains in place that long. Baltimore is expected to end this fiscal year with a $42.3 million deficit, as typical economic activity slows to a crawl. The city’s finance department also forecasts that the city will bring in about $100 million less in revenue than anticipated for the fiscal year that begins in July. As the city searches for cuts, Budget Director Bob Cenname said last week that “everything has to be on the table" because of the size of the shortfall. Last month, the city instituted a freeze on nonessential hiring and spending. Young said at an April 1 news conference that the city hadn’t contemplated laying off employees, but cautioned it was a possibility. “I personally don’t want to see layoffs, but if the budget dictates that, we have no other choice unless our president sends us some relief,” said the Democrat, repeating his call for more federal funding to be directed toward cities such as Baltimore.

Baltimore Police officers to use discretion for low-level arrests to limit coronavirus exposure
.W
Baltimore Police are encouraging officers to use discretion for low-level arrests to limit coronavirus exposure, department officials announced Thursday, a day after Baltimore’s State’s Attorney said she would drop minor cases. “For the safety of our residents and officers, the Baltimore Police Department is assessing and evaluating what calls-for-service our officers will be responding to in order to minimize the potential for exposure to COVID-19,” the police department statement said. “This includes giving guidance to officers in using their discretion to further minimize arrests on low-level and non-violent offenses, especially those outlined in the State’s Attorney letter.” The statement comes a day after Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced her office would stop prosecuting cases for drug possession, attempted distribution of any drug, prostitution, trespassing, minor traffic offenses, open container and urinating in public. Mosby said the decision was made to reduce the threat of a coronavirus outbreak behind bars. It covers individuals charged with low-level crimes who pose no risk to public safety and under normal circumstances be released before trial, she said. “An outbreak in prison or jails could potentially be catastrophic,” Mosby said. “Now is not the time for a piecemeal approach where we go into court and argue one one by one for the release of at-risk individuals." Mosby’s directive left some defense attorneys in Baltimore waiting to see if their clients will be set free. But her temporary policy only applies to new arrests and only those held at Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center. She also wrote Gov. Larry Hogan and asked him to release such prisoners from state corrections facilities. Internally, Baltimore Police advised officers that they can continue to charge people for low-level offenses using arrest warrants, and with approval of a lieutenant. “We are not limiting an officer’s discretion to effectuate an arrest; however, in the interest of public health and the health all our members, the BPD needs take steps to reduce COVID-19 exposure and contact that contributes to the spread of the virus,” wrote Michael Sullivan, the department’s deputy of operations, in the memo distributed to officers Wednesday and obtained by The Baltimore Sun. “Additionally, in light of the State’s Attorney’s public statement and procedures adopted at Central Booking, BPD is outlining steps to pursue law enforcement objectives while decreasing opportunity for the spread of the COVID-19 virus." Officers are instructed to detain an offender, confirm the person’s identity, complete an application for charges or other necessary reports, before releasing them. Additionally, the memo said officers are to “Consult with a Lieutenant or above to determine whether seeking criminal charges through an arrest warrant application is appropriate while balancing resource constraints and public harm.” Similarly, Philadelphia’s police commissioner said this week that officers there would continue to arrest individuals for low-level offenses but would process them on an arrest warrant and release them. The changes come as departments across the country are considering measures to limit exposure to the coronavirus among officers and other first responders. Baltimore Police officials last week said the department was ordering additional personal protective equipment, such as masks, for officers who must interact with potentially infected individuals. The city also required 911 call takers to screen calls to determine if they might involve an infected person. The department also closed its headquarters and district buildings to the public. As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases is expected to rise, Baltimore continues to grapple with high levels of violence and a dwindling number of officers. On Tuesday, a gunman opened fire on a group of people, injuring seven, and four others were injured in three shootings across the city Wednesday. The city has counted 61 homicides this year, and 114 non-fatal shootings, on pace with last year when the city recorded 348 homicides, the highest rate in its history. Baltimore Sun reporters Justin Fenton and Tim Prudente contributed to this story.

Enjoy the outdoors during coronavirus, Maryland, but be smart about it
.W
Even in a global pandemic and national emergency, children want to play. So families kept coming recently to a playground in Howard County. First, dozens of people showed up. Then more than 100, then more than 250 people, officials reported. Elsewhere, parks, playgrounds and basketball courts were overrun. They closed the gates. Bigger crowds than usual have begun heading outside to jogging trails, ball courts and parks. It’s all the result of coincidence: Spring has arrived during a coronavirus outbreak that has freed up Marylanders from work and school. While officials say it’s generally safe outdoors, they urge precautions. After all, this isn’t a holiday, Gov. Larry Hogan told families during a recent news conference. The governor banned gatherings of more than 10 people. “Some people are treating this like a vacation or spring break with parties and cookouts and large gatherings at some of our parks,” Hogan said. “Let me be very clear: If you are engaged in this type of activity, you are in violation of state law and you are endangering the lives of your fellow Marylanders.” The number of coronavirus cases continues to rise in Maryland, with at least 349 cases confirmed by state health officials. The virus has infected children, from an infant to a teenager. A 5-year-old girl in Howard County has the virus, and a Prince George’s County man in his 60s became the first in Maryland to die of it. Doctors believe the virus spreads mostly from people in close contact, within about six feet. So they are urging everyone to keep their distance; they call this “social distancing.” Respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes can be inhaled or land on others, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Touching contaminated surfaces can spread the virus. That’s why doctors are encouraging everyone to wash their hands frequently. Handshakes are a bad idea, and try to avoid touching your face. In Baltimore, health officials found the virus has already spread through the community, meaning people have become infected without knowing where they picked up the virus. Health officials have confirmed at least 41 cases in the city. While city parks remain open, officials suspended all recreation programs, rentals and permitted events. Recreational activities — including hiking, biking and horseback riding — at the Liberty, Loch Raven, and Prettyboy reservoirs will also be suspended starting March 23. Still, fresh air and exercise is important for mental and physical health, said Dr. Letitia Dzirasa, Baltimore’s health commissioner. She and other public health experts say parks and trails can be enjoyed safely, so long as everyone keeps six feet apart. This means riding bikes, walking or running, or playing only with the family you live with. Steer clear of others. No contact sports. And the playground equipment isn’t a good idea. The coronavirus can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours, according to experts. “If you are going to do outdoor activities, make use of personal equipment rather than park equipment,” Dzirasa said. “But definitely go enjoy the weather.” She adds that if the allure of the playground equipment is too strong and the kids end up on the monkey bars or swings, do a thorough hand washing. Meanwhile, the National Park Service has reported an onrush of visitors. A busy weekend caused officials to scale back hours and access to parks around the country. Across Maryland, parks and trails remain generally open, but officials have closed public restrooms and nature centers and canceled youth sports leagues. They are also taking measures to reduce big crowds outdoors. Baltimore officials routinely close the road over Loch Raven Reservoir to cars on weekends to allow for walkers, joggers and bicyclists. Loch Raven Drive draws an average of 1,500 people on Saturdays and Sundays, officials say. At first, they announced plans to keep the road open to traffic to reduce crowds and prevent chance of the virus spreading. Days later, however, they closed the reservoirs to all recreation. The crowds caused concern for officials in Howard County, who decided to leave the parks open to the public but close off access to the various playground equipment. Crews will be sent out to post warning of “keep off” on the slides, monkey bars and other equipment. “Those germs can stay on the equipment much longer, and we’re not able to sanitize them after each use,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball told families at a news conference Thursday. Last week, county officials counted 250 people around the playground at Meadowbrook Park in Ellicott City. More than 50 were on the basketball courts. The southern parking lot at Centennial Park was nearly filled to capacity. And there were so many people walking the Savage Mill Trail that officials counted 30 cars parked illegally along the road. These parks remain open, but officials closed the gates to slow the onrush. Families must walk on now. “Having our gates open was actually encouraging a lot of people to bring carloads in,” Ball said. He echoed the governor’s words. “This is not spring break. We need to take this seriously.” Going outdoors safely Practice social distancing, even when outdoors, by keeping 6 feet apart. Don’t allow children to play together in close contact. Avoid touching playground equipment, handrails or other fixtures that could contain the virus. The virus can live on these surfaces. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol If you touch a public surface. Cover your entire hands and rub until dry. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds once you get home. Most importantly, if you feel sick stay home.

Amid coronavirus pandemic, Howard County’s Muslims prepare for Ramadan without community
.W
Ainy Haider-Shah plans to wake up before the sun rises Friday morning and head to her Ellicott City kitchen for an early breakfast before beginning her first day of fasting. At this time last year, Haider-Shah’s day would have been filled with springtime routines — dropping her kids off at school and heading to work — before coming home to break the daily fast with her family. Now, like many Muslims across the world, that Ramadan celebration will have to adjust to the realities of the coronavirus pandemic. “It will change a lot this year, and I think there’s a loss there,” said Haider-Shah, 43. “With Ramadan, it’s one way that people renew their faith; it’s a way to renew the community faith because you see your friends.” Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is a month of reconnecting and recharging in which Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. During each evening of Ramadan, families and communities come together for iftar, the post-sunset meal that breaks the fast. Mahmoud Abdel-Hady, 67, the imam — or prayer leader — of Maryum Islamic Center and Masjid in Ellicott City, said this year’s Ramadan has people concerned the closeness of the holiday is not there. “The togetherness, breaking the fast together, getting together [is missing],” Abdel-Hady said. “You pray every night for an hour-and-a-half or two hours, shoulder to shoulder, standing in line.” To compensate for that, Abdel-Hady said Maryum Islamic Center will post YouTube videos of Ramadan lectures to try to imitate the feeling of closeness through the internet. “It is a time of spiritual reflection; it’s a time of understanding the blessings we have. You are reconnecting with God and making your faith stronger,” said Deeba Jafri, 55, the interfaith chairwoman of the Muslim Community Center in Silver Spring. “The image I’ve always used in my head is recharging a spiritual battery to get through the next 11 months.” Building and reconnecting with community is important during the month of Ramadan, according to Jafri. At the Muslim Community Center, she usually helped organize iftars for up to 500 people each night. “The most visible part of Ramadan, the part where we all gather together, is going to be missing this year,” said Jafri, an Elkridge resident. “In a month in which you’re building your own spirituality, you’re also seeing everyone every single day. That will be the hardest part.” Jafri said she’s also worried about how the lack of community celebration will affect local businesses. The Muslim Community Center would typically be supplying food from local restaurants and catering companies for hundreds of people each night of Ramadan. That business won’t be headed their way this year. “The ripple effect of [coronavirus] is staggering, it’s huge,” she said. Khaleda Hasan, a Laurel resident, grew up with iftars in her Prince George’s County home alongside her parents and sister, a tradition they’ve been able to keep over the years. This year, her mother dropped off bags of samosas — pastries with a savory filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, cheese, meat or lentils — and other Ramadan treats to last the month. Hasan said the family will break bread together virtually, if not in person. “A lot of people in the community have [in the past had] daily and weekly interactions with the mosque. For them, [this year is] going to be a harder tradition,” said Hasan, 42. She’s signed up her two children, ages 7 and 12, for a virtual Ramadan kids program, something that fits better in their schedules with fewer after-school activities. For Hasan, Jafri and Haider-Shah, however, the segment of Ramadan they’ll miss most this year is the four weekend iftars with family and friends. “In our family, it’s a race to book the slots; four weekends fill up quickly,” Jafri said. “Your social calendar in Ramadan is packed out with events to go to.” At least one positive thing to come out of celebrating Ramadan during a pandemic, Abdel-Hady said, is the closeness of family members during this time and the memories children will have of celebrating each of the 30 nights at home. “One of the things I’ve lost in COVID-19 is my routine. Ramadan will put the routine back in my life,” Jafri said. “There’s going to be more commitment to a sense of structure in my life, and I think I need that after six weeks of this.”

Hogan announces ‘strike teams’ for responding to coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Tuesday announced the creation of “strike teams” to provide immediate support to nursing homes experiencing outbreaks of coronavirus cases across the state. At least 90 such facilities have confirmed cases of the virus in Maryland, Hogan said. One in Carroll County — Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy — has experienced at least 17 deaths as of Tuesday and dozens of other infections among residents and staff. The strike teams, composed of healthcare workers from local hospitals, National Guard members and other front-line public health personnel from state and local health departments, will be capable of providing three forms of support, Hogan said. They will oversee testing and guide efforts to separate exposed residents and staff from others; provide logistics support and equipment while helping to triage patients who are believed to have been exposed; and bring medical supplies and workers directly to the facilities to help avoid unnecessary transfers of patients to local hospitals, Hogan said. “We’re the first state in the nation to launch such a coordinated response effort,” Hogan said. “The goal here is not to replace a nursing home’s medical or clinical team, but to provide immediate support and assistance to help protect residents.” The announcement followed Hogan’s emergency order Sunday that mandated nursing homes use expedited testing options to identify infections more quickly among symptomatic residents and staff, and required that all nursing home staff wear masks, gowns and other protective equipment when interacting with residents. Hogan said the efforts were meant to help save lives in the state, where there are 226 licensed nursing homes. However, the mandates fall short of requiring all staff at nursing homes across the state to be tested for the virus — despite signs that such action could be a major factor in preventing further spread. That’s partly because of a lack of tests nationwide. Some industry leaders question whether the state efforts will be enough to slow the spread of the COVID-19 illness in nursing homes given that lack of testing, and a similar lack of protective gear. Both Hogan and Fran Phillips, deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Health, have said they believe the coronavirus is spreading through the state’s nursing homes — and entered Pleasant View — via staff members who are not showing any symptoms of infection. “There were no symptomatic staff. No visitors. It must have been staff coming into a nursing home and unwittingly carrying the virus,” Phillips said Monday in an interview with The Baltimore Sun. Phillips said the state is testing all nursing home workers that have symptoms of coronavirus, but is not able to test asymptomatic staff due to the lack of tests. “We are still in a national shortage of the basic raw materials that are necessary to do these tests,” Phillips said. “It is a continuing source of frustration.” At Pleasant View Nursing Home, where some staff also work at other facilities, Phillips said it’s important to track where the infection came from. But she and other state officials have not answered questions about what tracking efforts may be underway to determine the movement of those workers, and what role the state and local health departments are playing in that effort. At Pleasant View, there are now temperature checks and screening questions to the enter the facility, she said. Phillips said the state is following CDC guidelines for how to use its limited testing resources. Once enough tests are available, she said, “we want to test a huge range of people.” She also cited the new mandate for all nursing home staff to wear protective gear when they interact with patients. “That’s as important as testing to interrupt the spread,” Phillips said. Phillips said nursing homes are expected to purchase supplies, but the state would offer help for nursing homes that need more resources. “I know everybody is nervous about that,” she said of supply shortages. Allison Ciborowski, president of Leading Age Maryland, an association of nonprofit homes in the state, said nursing home leaders welcome Hogan’s efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, including the directive to have staff wear protective gear. While the industry has long emphasized the importance of preventing infections, the novel coronavirus presents new challenges, she said — especially with asymptomatic workers. Still, it’s not yet clear if the measures being put in place will be enough to stop the spread of the virus in nursing homes, especially as tests, masks and other gear remain in short supply, industry leaders said. Kevin Heffner, president of LifeSpan Network, a state nursing home industry group, said staff still have to use any available tests “judiciously,” with not nearly enough to go around for staff and residents who may be at risk but appear healthy. Ciborowski said she expects cases to continue to rise. “The steps Governor Hogan has taken I think are important to slowing the spread, but I don’t think anyone can predict exactly when things will get better," she said. “We’re doing the best we can with what we have.”

Health care provider at Northwest Hospital, patient at Sinai test positive for coronavirus, Lifebridge Health says
.W
A health care provider at Northwest Hospital in Randallstown and a patient at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore have both tested positive for the new coronavirus, LifeBridge Health said in a statement Wednesday. The provider informed their staff and went into a home quarantine, and the hospitals’ parent company said it has “identified individuals who may have come into contact with this provider, including patients and employees." “We are following our internal protocols, including state and federal guidelines, to determine the next appropriate steps,” LifeBridge said in the statement. The patient who tested positive for COVID-19 is “doing well and we expect them to be discharged from the hospital soon,” LifeBridge said. “Our staff has been following protocols and appropriate precautions in caring for this person," the statement said. The disease has infected more than 200,000 people and killed more than 8,000 globally, and about 83,000 have recovered. The number of confirmed cases of the virus in Maryland jumped more than 50% on Tuesday as officials expanded testing. The state has closed schools for two weeks and reduced transit service, among other measures, and Gov. Larry Hogan has ordered bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to close and asked residents to practice social distancing. Baltimore Sun reporter Hallie Miller contributed to this article.

Gov. Hogan issues stay-at-home order for Maryland to stop spread of the coronavirus
.W
Marylanders may only leave their homes for essential work or urgent medical care, to get food or prescriptions or for other “absolutely necessary” reasons, Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday under a new “stay-at-home” directive to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “This is the deadly public health crisis,” the Republican governor said. “We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home. We are directing them to do so.” Hogan said the additional measures were necessary given the concern that the virus could hinder the federal government’s ability to respond to the crisis. That’s due to the concentration of the capital-area workforce in the state. The governor said he was also worried about the possibility the disease could spread to “literally thousands” of facilities in Maryland, including hospitals, detention centers and nursing homes. With similar orders issued Monday by District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, both Democrats, the region is now under a quasi-lockdown — a drastic change in how people live and work in the Mid-Atlantic compared to just a few weeks ago. For Marylanders who have followed Hogan’s prior orders and recommendations from health officials, the stay-at-home directive may make little difference. No additional businesses are required to close and residents don’t have to stay in their homes at all times. “People have to go out and get food. They need to get prescriptions," Hogan said. "You should be able to get outside for your own physical and mental well-being and go for a walk and take your dog for a walk.” But with the new order and with blunt language, Hogan sought to get the attention of residents who didn’t take earlier directives seriously. The stay-at-home directive will be enforced, the governor said. Any person who knowingly and willfully violates it is guilty of a misdemeanor. At least two people have been charged with throwing parties in violation of prior orders, which restrict gatherings to no more than 10 people. They are a Charles County man who allegedly hosted a bonfire for dozens of guests and a man who rented a hotel room in Carroll County for a party that allegedly included underage drinking. “Marylanders need to know that, unfortunately, we are only at the beginning of this crisis and it is going to get considerably worse before it gets better,” Hogan said. “I realize this is incredibly difficult on everyone in our state, but I want people to know that we have been through difficult challenges before and that we are going to get through this together.” Hogan said people who have returned to Maryland from other states should self-quarantine for 14 days, and he discouraged residents from traveling out-of-state. “This is a rapidly escalating emergency situation,” the governor said. Congregating in parks or shopping for home goods is not OK, he emphasized, urging people to exercise “common sense.” Monday afternoon, after the announcement, lines formed at liquor stores and some Marylanders posted on social media about the need to make alcohol purchases before 8 p.m. (Liquor stores, however, remain on the list of “essential” businesses — and are therefore allowed to stay open.) Graciela Gómez said when she first heard about the directive Monday, she worried that it closed restaurants and drive-thrus. Concerned there could be a run on grocery stores, the 21-year-old Gaithersburg resident stocked up on carryout from restaurants. Only after reading the executive order did Gómez realize there was no risk of further closures to food and beverage businesses. Restaurants and liquor stores can stay open for carryout, curbside and delivery service. Supermarkets and pharmacies can remain open as long as social distancing measures, such as keeping customers 6 feet apart, are respected. People seeking guidance on the order Monday flooded the Twitter feed of the governor’s spokesman, Mike Ricci. Nearly 50 people tweeted about being able to get fresh air, walk a dog or get a car repaired. Ricci replied that those were all acceptable, as long as people continued to practice social distancing. The situation could continue for months, said Fran Phillips, Maryland’s deputy health secretary. “We have no vaccine to protect us against this virus,” she said. “We have no treatments to cure this disease.” Phillips said young people should not think of themselves as being immune. More than half of all positive cases in Maryland involve people age 50 and younger. Of those who are hospitalized, 56% are younger than 60. The state’s youngest patient is a month-old infant. Most people will be able to stay at home to recover, Phillips said. Others, however, will not be able to breathe on their own. She said the virus spreads easily and it takes days for symptoms to appear. “This virus and this disease are sneaky,” Phillips said, adding, “What you do today, what you do tomorrow, matters. There are some very sick people here in Maryland.” To increase the ability for people to be tested, the state opened drive-thru sites at Motor Vehicle Administration emissions stations in Glen Burnie, Waldorf and Bel Air, Hogan said. Another opened at FedEx Field in Landover. Testing at the sites is limited to those with orders from a health care provider and an appointment, Hogan said. Confirmed cases in Maryland have reached 1,413 as of Monday. Fifteen people have died from COVID-19. The largest concentration of known cases are in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties. They have 341 and 294 cases, respectively. Baltimore County had 186, according to state numbers. Anne Arundel County had 110. Howard County had 96. Carroll County had 82. Charles County had 33. Frederick County had 26 and Harford County had 24. In Baltimore City, 142 were diagnosed with the coronavirus. Local officials offered support for Hogan’s order and sought to amplify his message. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said he backs Hogan’s decision to put more restrictions in place to protect the public and he urged city residents to follow the governor’s orders. The stay-at-home directive will not impact essential services, Young said, and trash and recycling will still be picked up. “In order to flatten the curve of this disease and save as many lives as possible, we need to give our health care workers and essential employees the space that they need to work,” Young, a Democrat, said. Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr., a Democrat, said Hogan’s decision to issue the stay-at-home order “was the right one.” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball, also a Democrat, cautioned county residents: “There is no excuse for taking this directive lightly. In order to slow the spread, it is vital that we stay home and reduce contact with one another.” Many other measures are underway to respond to the crisis throughout Maryland. To prepare for a surge in patients, the governor said the state has ordered 500 beds for hospitals to add more capacity on their campuses. A request for another 500 has been made so they can distributed as hot spots arise. Hogan said the state also has ordered more medical tents. The governor called doctors and nurses “true heroes.” To help protect them amid the supply shortage, the state’s school systems have donated various items, such as gloves, masks and gowns. “We are all going to need to depend on each other, to look out for each and to take care of each other. We are all in this together,” Hogan said. An outbreak in the region is especially alarming because more than 404,000 federal workers live in Maryland, Washington and Virginia and are on the front lines of the government’s response. Among the federal agencies based in Maryland are the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. “A major outbreak among our critical federal work workforce could be catastrophic, crippling the national response,” Hogan said. He has joined Northam and Bowser in asking Republican President Donald Trump to make the region a priority for federal support. Currently, the region has 2,709 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Maryland will need significant financial help from the federal government. This crisis is going to be “devastating” to the state budget and will perhaps drain its entire rainy day fund, Hogan said. Since it was announced last week, the state has received thousands of applications for money from Maryland’s $175 million relief package for businesses and unemployed workers. One program has already provided nearly $9 million to more than 400 small business, in turn, helping more than 8,000 Marylanders keep their jobs. Donald C. Fry, president of the Greater Baltimore Committee, said while he understands the governor’s new order will create more hardship for businesses, employers and employees, “it is meant to ensure that Maryland can respond aggressively to the COVID-19 pandemic and enable us to bounce back when the crisis subsides.” Others are able to continue to operate through the use of technology, he said. “Many businesses have fully transitioned to telework and are doing all they can to keep their operations and the economy as strong and viable during these challenging times,” Fry said. "Taking steps to provide for a healthy workforce will help with the economic recovery once we are in a position to return to normal business operations.” Baltimore Sun reporter McKenna Oxenden contributed to this article.

Second resident of Mount Airy nursing home dies amid coronavirus outbreak; Oak Crest resident tests positive
.W
A second Carroll County resident has died amid a major coronavirus outbreak at a Mount Airy nursing home, and in Howard County, officials revealed Monday that the virus killed a resident of a nursing home there earlier this month. With a resident also testing positive at a Baltimore County retirement community Sunday, concern is growing in Maryland that the coronavirus could be potently spreading among older people living in close quarters, as it has in other states. In issuing a statewide stay-at-home order Monday, Gov. Larry Hogan said the restrictions are needed to prevent the virus from spreading to “literally thousands” of facilities in Maryland, including nursing homes. Many of the facilities have been preparing for that possibility for more than a month, even before cases of COVID-19 were reported in the U.S., said Joe DeMattos, executive director of the Health Facilities Association of Maryland. But DeMattos said he doesn’t expect them all to succeed in preventing contagion. “The reality is there will be more outbreaks,” he said. The second COVID-19 victim at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy was a man in his 80s with underlying health conditions, Carroll health officials said. He was among 66 residents there who tested positive for the virus last week, and one of them, a man in his 90s, died Saturday. At least 17 of the residents were taken to hospitals in Carroll and Frederick counties over the weekend. And Carroll health officials said tests came back positive Monday for 11 more residents, meaning 77 of 95 residents living at the facility contracted the virus. The other 18 tested negative, officials said. The residents, all of whom require skilled nursing services, live four to a room, separated by privacy curtains, said Rebecca Travels, the facility’s administrator. Some share bathrooms. Travels said that earlier this month, she had wanted to preemptively test staff and residents, but they didn’t meet criteria for testing, including international travel or contact with a confirmed positive case. It wasn’t until Wednesday that residents could be tested through a private lab, she said. She expressed frustration with the delay, saying all health care facilities should be able to press for testing — and to demand it for their staff. “As an industry, as an administrator, one of the frustrating things, I think, for all of us at that time, was the lack of availability, the lack of access to testing,” Travels said. “I don’t want this to happen to anyone else." In Howard County, officials at the Residences at Vantage Point in Columbia said a resident at the retirement community who recently died at a hospital tested positive for COVID-19. They did not provide further details. And in Baltimore County, a resident at the Oak Crest retirement community in Parkville also has tested positive for the virus. Facility owner Erickson Living said Monday that staff are monitoring residents and employees for symptoms of the respiratory virus that has now infected more than 1,400 Marylanders. The cases come as nursing homes were already bracing for the coronavirus. DeMattos said the organization representing a wide variety of health care facilities, including those serving senior citizens, had in February started urging staff to wear personal protective equipment and to aggressively screen for travelers from overseas. They later urged Hogan to demand all nursing homes restrict visitor access, which he ordered March 10. Coronavirus outbreaks have already occurred in nursing homes in states including Washington, New Jersey, Arkansas and Illinois. In one of the first major clusters of infection in the United States, dozens of residents at the Life Care Center in suburban Seattle fell sick and died of the virus. As the first cases began getting reported in Maryland at the start of the month, residents of a retirement community in Rockville began self-isolating after staff reported that a coronavirus patient had attended an event there. The Villages at Rockville also canceled all events. It has not reported any residents falling ill from the virus since. Infectious diseases have long been of concern in nursing homes, where older patients with compromised immune systems are at the highest risk for serious infections and complications. Nationally, an estimated 765,000 to 2.8 million infections occur per year in long-term care facilities, and nursing homes account for 45% of all reported outbreaks in the country, according to the Maryland Infection Control Group at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, which advises facilities on ways to protect residents. Still, nursing facilities across the nation continue to score poorly in federal evaluations, including in areas of cleanliness and staffing. That includes facilities in Maryland. In 2017, the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that Maryland had failed to investigate nearly 650 allegations of harm at Maryland nursing homes within a required 10-day window, missing the federal deadline 74 percent of the time. It ranked seventh-worst in the nation. Federal auditors found similar problems in 1999, 2006 and 2011, too, but more recent data has shown improvement. Maryland’s number of high-priority complaints not investigated within 10 days fell from 915 in 2016 to 269 in 2018.

‘There’s too many unknowns’: Many Maryland barbers hesitant to open for essential workers amid coronavirus risk
.W
Although Maryland last week opened the door for barbers and stylists to serve some essential workers, many operators remain closed, citing the health risks and the difficulty of maintaining social distancing. “That’s the thing that I was kicking over: Is it really worth it?” said Oscar Bueno, who runs OurSpot out of the Phoenix Salon Suites in South Baltimore’s Riverside neighborhood. “I came to the conclusion that it really isn’t.” Bueno said a close family member has a compromised immune system, and the idea of being a carrier of the coronavirus isn’t worth opening back up, even though he had several customers reach out the day after the order was written. The governor’s Office of Legal Counsel announced April 20 that barbershops and salons were to remain closed in general but could perform appointment-only services for essential workers whose employer had documented grooming standards that needed to be met. Under the new guidelines, if a customer could provide written documentation of those standards, and both the barber and salon staff wore masks and were the only people in the building, the service would be allowed. Businesses would have to keep contact information for each customer should someone they serve test positive and others need to be notified of the results. The assumption, according to the order, was that the exemption would be used “for military personnel, first responders, and other essential workers required to maintain certain, well-documented grooming standards as part of their profession, or where ungroomed hair could pose a safety risk.” Jade Flinn, critical care nurse and nurse educator at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said in a statement that barbershops and salons can safely provide services “if necessary precautions are taken, including good infection control practices of workplaces and respiratory etiquette, including masking and coughing/sneezing away from others. “There will always be a risk taken when venturing into public spaces, including hair salons and barbershops for essential business, so our safety relies upon mutual protective measures.” The National Association of Barber Boards of America has guidelines on its website for shops to reopen that include many of the precautions outlined in the state’s order, including wearing masks, requiring appointments, and limiting the number of staff and customers inside a shop. On Friday, Georgia allowed all barbershops and salons to resume operations as part of a partial reopening of the state. At one shop, customers were subject to a temperature check, questioning, mask and gloves, while workers were to be outfitted in gloves, masks, gowns and face shields, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. A spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Labor said there were 52,367 barbers and cosmetologists registered in the state. The national Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that in 2018, 75% of barbers nationwide were self-employed; the bureau also estimates that 44% of hairdressers, hairstylists and cosmetologists were self-employed. These barbers and hairdressers have been out of work since the Gov. Larry Hogan ordered Maryland’s nonessential businesses closed on March 23. Many of the barbershops around the state’s military installations, including Fort Meade and Aberdeen Proving Ground, also have remained closed despite the opportunity to reopen now. Several still had outgoing voicemail messages saying they were closed due to the pandemic, even after the regulations changed. While some barbershops and salons remain closed, others are gearing to reopen, while making sure to take all precautions to remain safe. In an email to customers April 22, the QG, a department store in Baltimore that provides haircuts among other services, said it has “received a deluge of requests/questions.” The store wrote it would try to find a safe, orderly way to provide services for essential personnel who needed to keep up with grooming standards. However, some services, such as razor outline and hair rinsing, would not be provided. Pre-payment for services also would be required to eliminate hand-to-hand contact and customers would be required to sign a waiver. The store also wrote it was reviewing its pricing, given the “extra manpower, cleaning resources and the additional time we will be needing to comply with these regulations.” The store did not respond to a request for comment, and its website says it remains closed. Even the demand that comes from essential workers who need haircuts didn’t create enough business opportunities for many to rush open. The operator of the Olney barbershop 1 Cut Above posted on Instagram that he wouldn’t be opening because only serving essential workers who could be more exposed to COVID-19 than non-essential workers who are staying at home is “counterintuitive.” “I’m pretty healthy myself,” Bueno said. “But to put other people at risk — the thing is we don’t know who has what, and this is something that’s been up in the air since its inception and there’s just too many unknowns. I don’t want to put my people at risk at all.”

Johns Hopkins experts are learning more about the coronavirus. Here’s what they want you to know.
.W
As much of Maryland and the United States hunker down at home to help stop spread of the coronavirus, scientists are making progress in understanding how the virus is transmitted, how it affects humans and, most importantly, how it can be stopped. Experts at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health offered some updates and things people can do now. This Q&A is adapted from a webcast moderated by Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement, and including Andy Pekosz, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology, and Caitlin Rivers, senior scholar in the Center for Health Security. How infectious is this coronavirus? It’s pretty good at spreading from person to person, better than some other coronaviruses including MERS and SARS. So there are more infections, but unlike those others it mostly causes mild illness. Those with serious symptoms of the disease named COVID-19, such as trouble breathing and fever, are more likely to seek care, though those with mild disease are still infectious and “driving the transmission train,” as they go about their day, Pekosz said. Scientists are using cell cultures in the lab to mimic the upper respiratory track of humans so they can see why the virus spreads so efficiently and what may stop it. How is the virus transmitted from person to person? The culprits are the rather large droplets that people cough or sneeze through the air to people or common surfaces. This is why it’s important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze and avoid touching your face and stay three to six feet away from others. Fine droplets that float around the air don’t seem to cause as much trouble. How long can the virus live on surfaces and how can you kill it? It can live on surfaces, such as railings and tables and phones for a few hours to up to 24 hours. But the virus is sensitive to antimicrobial cleaners. Use cleaners that are marked antimicrobial or dilute bleach with water at a 1 to 10 ratio and wipe. If you don’t have those, use rubbing alcohol from the medicine cabinet. You can use right from the bottle if it’s 70% or dilute it a bit if it’s 90% to make it go a little farther. Will we get a respite when it gets warm? The short answer is no one knows. Other viruses, such as flu viruses, are way less efficient at spreading in the summer. But since this is a new virus and no one has immunity, it still could infect people. That’s what happened during the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. “We have to prepare for dealing with this during the summer,” he said. Can we use antibodies from those who have recovered for treatment? It’s being studied at Hopkins and elsewhere. Studies in China suggest this could work, and there is a history of using antibodies from survivors of other infectious diseases. Is a vaccine coming? The first vaccine trial in humans have begun, and a trial for a second vaccine will begin soon. These are early stage trials, however, only testing the vaccine’s safety and not its effectiveness. This is amazing speed, since the virus was only genetically mapped in the past two months, but that doesn’t mean people will be inoculated widely any time soon. The vaccines will need to be tested to see if they work against the virus in later-stage trials. An effective vaccine is still likely 12 to 18 months away. “This is not a short-term solution,” Pekosz said. Are people becoming aware and taking proper steps to control spread in the meantime? Testing is expanding and awareness of procedures to control spread appear to be taking hold. But the number of cases is likely to continue going up. Any tactics mandated now won’t show up in data for seven to 10 days because the incubation period, the time between infection and symptoms, is about five days and then people have to realize they are sick and call their doctor. “Maintain vigilance, however, because it does help,” Rivers said. What is “social distancing”? This is putting physical space between people so the virus has a harder time transmitting through those droplets. Spread control also means a lot of hand washing — particularly after returning from outside or before eating — avoiding high touch surfaces, such as grocery carts that are not wiped down, and staying home, especially when sick. Closing bars, restaurants and schools and canceling large events can have big effects because that reduces crowds of people. Are some countries doing a better job at this? Countries do seem to be having different experiences. France and Italy had a lot of sick people while some Asian countries have not. This could be because those in some Asian countries were heavily impacted by other coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and have learned lessons on social distancing. Some of those countries have had lower rates of other infections such as pink eye, which shows mitigation measures work in general. What does it mean to “flatten the curve”? The idea is that if transmission slows, it leads to fewer new cases at one time. For example, if 100 people get sick, they get sick over 10 weeks, instead of in one week. This helps the health care system manage everyone’s illnesses. We are closer to the beginning of the curve at this time. If you are young and healthy and not at particular risk do you still need to practice social distancing? It’s true that young healthy people have lower risk of the illness, but they are a “bridge” to older and sicker people, Rivers said. Disease can spread only if there are people to spread it to. Sometimes those vulnerable people have to leave home for groceries or doctor visits and they could come into contact with others who are infected and may not know or aren’t being vigilant. Think about it as infecting your grandparents. What should you do about your routine doctor’s visit and what should the doctor’s office be doing? If you don’t need to go now, don’t go. If you do go, and you’re healthy, a mask won’t help you. The masks are for those who are sick. And if you are sick, call ahead to let the office know so they can get you directly to an isolated room so you don’t infect others. Offices and hospitals should consider canceling elective procedures and visits. They should wipe their surfaces regularly and have sanitizer at the ready. Is it okay to go outside? It’s more than okay. It’s a good idea. Just keep your distance from others. Walking, hiking and biking are good. Contact sports are a no-no. Exercise is physically and mentally important, especially in stressful times. If you know someone who can’t go outside, like an older person, call them regularly. Social distancing only applies to physical space, not all human connections.

Maryland has 6,968 confirmed coronavirus cases, deaths jump 24% to 171
.W
Coronavirus fatalities in Maryland increased 24% in one day as state officials announced 171 deaths and 6,968 confirmed cases Friday. Since Monday, coronavirus-related fatalities have nearly doubled: Five days ago, 91 people had died from the coronavirus. The state added 783 cases between Thursday and Friday. The state also released Friday a racial breakdown of the new cases, a process that began Thursday after officials faced weeks of mounting pressure. Black Marylanders now make up 2,304 of the state’s known cases and 61 of the related fatalities. White Marylanders, meanwhile, comprised 1,694 of the known cases and 45 of the deaths despite making up a larger share of the state’s population, according to U.S. Census data. According to the state’s tally, 1,483 Marylanders have been hospitalized for COVID-19, an increase of 65 people within the last day. Medical experts in the state said while hospitals have not yet reached capacity, they will prepare for a dramatic surge in patients in the region, which some have referred to as an “emerging hotspot” for the coronavirus. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan will speak Friday at 12:30 p.m. in Annapolis. Earlier this week, he said laboratories working through backlogs of testing kits, some left over from March, attributed to the jump in confirmed cases. The state has seen a 72% increase in confirmed cases since Monday. This article will be updated.

With hopes to play in NFL, former Howard star Winston DeLattiboudere continues training through coronavirus pandemic
.W
The University of Minnesota’s football pro day was less than two weeks away, and Winston DeLattiboudere III was preparing for an important workout that could raise his stock ahead of the NFL Draft and the undrafted free-agent process that follows. However, the Gophers’ pro day, which was scheduled for March 25, was canceled due to the coronavirus, and the former Howard High School football star turned Division I defensive end had a hectic next few weeks — an 18-hour car ride back from Minnesota, training during a global pandemic and filming his own pro day. “It was tough,” DeLattiboudere said. “If you know football, you know about the pro day. It’s something you’re waiting on your whole life. Even when you play Madden, you tap the 'X' button to run the 40-yard dash. I felt like I was in the best shape of my life, and then it was kind of stripped away.” Once DeLattiboudere — a Baltimore Sun and Howard County Defensive Player of the Year as a senior in 2014 — learned the pro day was canceled, he had to make the trek back from the Twin Cities to Howard County. He stopped in Michigan to spend a night with his girlfriend, listened to music, called friends and thought about his football future. “I got in the car and drove home to kind of filter and process what my next move was going to be,” he said. “It’s not over when others say it’s over, so I knew I had to make something happen.” During the ride, he called two of his old high school teammates — Christian Dargan about Isaiah Stokes — to ask if they’d help him train when he got back home and then help with his makeshift pro day. “Your loyalty shows in your friendships when the chips are down and your back is against the wall, and those guys really helped me out," he said. “We were drilling everything. Isaiah would work with me every day with speed stuff, and Christian would help me with the drill stuff and body position stuff that I had been working on. We ran it all by ourselves, and we got somebody out there to film it. There were only four people out there so we could comply by the rules.” Bruce Strunk, DeLattiboudere’s high school coach, said “it was really good to see” Dargan and Stokes helping DeLattiboudere train. At his pro day on March 29, DeLattiboudere ran a 4.78-second 40-yard dash, a 6.96-second L-cone time and a 4.31-second pro agility time as well as a 78.75-inch wing span. “That’s one thing about Winston. If you’re friends with him, you’re friends for life," Strunk said. One of the sad parts of me moving up to Massachusetts is I don’t get to see guys like Winston, Christian and Isaiah.” Strunk, who coached nine years at Howard, said he still keeps in contact with DeLattiboudere and that he saw most of his games on the Big Ten Network. In his senior season at Howard, DeLattiboudere led No. 5 Howard to a 12-1 record and its first state semifinal appearance since 1999. The Lions allowed only 7.5 points per game in 2014 and pitched five shutouts as DeLattiboudere tallied 101 tackles, including 42 for a loss, and also had 17.5 sacks and 38 quarterback hurries. “It’s been great to watch him grow," said Strunk. “His work ethic is why Winston is where he is — his work ethic, his coachability, his character. He’s all the things you want in a player. The maturity level is high. He’s going to do things right. He’s got it all.” After redshirting his first season at Minnesota, DeLattiboudere went on to play in all 51 of the Gophers’ games in his four seasons, starting 35 of those contests and tallying 83 tackles — 13.5 of which for a loss — and five sacks. As a senior, the 6-foot, 2.5-inch, 255-pound defensive end started all 13 games, recorded 30 tackles and forced two fumbles. He also won the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award and the Tony Dungy Character and Community Service Award. “The scouts have told me that I’m a reliable football player,” he said. “I played 51 games in the Big Ten and started 35 of them. You don’t just throw anybody out there to play in the Big Ten. Now, the scouts are trying to see how much I can improve on an athleticism platform. I have the IQ for it, and I can play multiple positions, but during this process they’ve just wanted to see how much faster and quicker I can get.” One question mark for DeLattiboudere is what position he’ll play at the next level. He says he’s open to playing defensive tackle, defensive end and outside linebacker. Most of his experience is as a defensive end, which is the position he played in both high school and college. But his size (6-2.5, 255 pounds) pegs him better as an outside linebacker at the NFL level, which is why he’s been practicing the technique at that position this offseason. “I’m working on my speed and the outside linebacker drills," he said. "I had to work on things like my back pedal and things that are natural for linebackers. But if you drill something enough, you can definitely get it down.” With the NFL Draft starting on Thursday and ending Saturday, DeLattiboudere is waiting for the process to play out. While it’s still to be seen whether DeLattiboudere will be a Day 3 draft selection or an undrafted free agent signee, he doesn’t care how he gets to the NFL or what position he’s asked to play — so long as he gets there. “I’m taking everything one day at a time. I’m projected seventh round/priority free agent," DeLattiboudere said. “Whatever team calls, I’m ready to play special teams and defensive end. If they want me to put on 30 pounds and play defensive tackle, I will. If they want me to drop back and play outside linebacker, I will. And if they want me to scrub the tables after the team is done eating lunch, I’ll do that, too. I am ready to get with a club and seize my potential and the ability I have.”

How to get tested for coronavirus in Carroll County, and other advice
.W
As the coronavirus also known by the disease its causes, COVID-19, spreads throughout the country and state, many Carroll countians are likely to wonder whether they should be tested. Here’s a guide on what you should do if you’re asking that question: Health department advice Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. The health department plans to inform the public when testing is expanded through its website at https://cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/ and social media channels on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. “Testing is limited at this time because COVID-19 is a new infection, and laboratories are working rapidly to increase availability,” the health department wrote. Testing is only available to those who have been referred by a heath care provider. Those who show worsening or severe symptoms — such as trouble breathing — should contact their medical provider. Those who are 65 or older, have other medical issues, are pregnant, or are immunocompromised should do so even with mild symptoms. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The health department in a news release gave the following guidelines: • If you have no symptoms, you do not need to be tested. • If you have mild symptoms, you should stay home and monitor your symptoms. You do not need to be tested. • If your symptoms worsen, contact your health care provider who can decide if you need testing. • If you are over the age of 65, have other medical issues, or are immunocompromised, call your healthcare provider even if your illness is mild. You are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and your health care provider will decide if you need testing. • If you are pregnant, call your health care provider even if your illness is mild. It is not yet known if pregnant women are at higher risk of COVID-19; your health care provider will decide if you need testing. • If you have severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, seek immediate medical care. If you have any type of respiratory illness, follow these steps to isolate yourself, monitor your illness, and prevent the spread of illness to others: • Separate yourself from other family members as much as possible • You may wear a facemask around others if you have one • Avoid sharing household items • Wash your hands and clean surfaces often • Monitor your symptoms and temperature You may return to work and other activities after you have been without symptoms and fever-free without medication for at least 72 hours or 7 days after your symptoms started, whichever is longer. A cough may persist, so continue to cover your cough. Drive-up testing at Carroll Hospital Carroll Hospital is offering drive-up testing for the coronavirus, though that testing is only open to individuals who have been screened and referred by their physician. The hospital has set up a specimen collection tent on the third floor of its parking garage to allow for the rapid testing of those suspected of having the coronavirus but are not yet showing symptoms. Those specimens collected are then sent to LabCorp for analysis, with results taking three to four days. “People can drive up to be tested, so it is mobile testing, however, they have to be screened first through their primary care provider, who is then referring them to a LifeBridge telehealth triaging system,” said Carroll Hospital President and Executive Vice President of LifeBridge Health Leslie Simmons. “We are utilizing the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines to determine who is at high risk, and if they meet high risk criteria, then they are referred to Carroll Hospital’s specimen collection tent.” The tent is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., then from noon to 6 p.m. “The hospitals are going to get to capacity very quickly and we need to make sure we have space for the sickest of the sick," Simmons said. “We erected the tent outside the emergency department because we are concerned we will run out of capacity quickly and the tents will help us manage that to some degree.”

Southwest District officers return to work after brief closure due to positive coronavirus test 
.W
More than one hundred officers assigned to the Baltimore Police Department’s Southwest District returned to work after the district briefly for cleaning when an officer first tested for the new coronavirus. Three officers at the district have tested positive, and 42 others remain quarantined, Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said at a news conference Tuesday. “We are slowly getting back to normal operations,” he said. “All of our officers either screened or tested,” and the Southwest District station house and vehicles were cleaned, Harrison said. The department previously said all personnel assigned to the district would be tested, but in a statement on Monday, the department said only some officers would be tested for COVID-19. “Our health partners coordinated with the department’s Infectious Control Officer to evaluate all officers and civilians assigned to the district to determine what members needed to be tested, in accordance with CDC and medical guidelines,” the statement said. Officers who didn’t show symptoms, or who didn’t come into the building, for example, were evaluated by the health partners, and might not have required a test, police spokeswoman Lindsey Eldridge said. Additionally, the department has begun new protocols for officers to complete daily health checks, including twice a day body temperature checks. Across the entire department, 115 of the 2,500 sworn officers remain quarantined. A total of 309 have been quarantined since the beginning of the pandemic, he said. A total of 12 officers have tested positive and another 59 had pending tests Tuesday. “We’re working to make sure, as much as possible, we can protect our people,” Harrison said. "Just about all of our officers” have received N95 masks and additional personal protective equipment, he said. “As it comes it, we are continuing to distribute it,” he said. Harrison said that the pandemic has not limited the department in its efforts to respond to crime. “Even amidst a pandemic, the culture of violence is still very pervasive, and people are still trying to solve their conflicts with gun violence," he said. Speaking about a recent officer-involved shooting during which three officers shot an armed man in East Baltimore last week, Harrison said incident shows officers are not falling down on the job. “Officers are engaging, the officers are being proactive," he said. "The officers are not backing down but were running toward the danger to make sure we remove violent offenders from the streets of Baltimore, and we will continue to do that.”

Jews can celebrate Passover ‘alone together’ during coronavirus, Bel Air rabbi says
.W
Jews in Harford County, who in prior years would celebrate the holiday of Passover with family and friends, must spend the holiday apart this year because of the state’s stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic. People might be conducting their seder, the festive Passover dinner, solo, but they will not be alone, as many Jews around the world who also are dealing with the pandemic are doing the same thing, according to Rabbi Kushi Schusterman of Harford Chabad in Bel Air. “There are thousands, if not millions, of Jews this year who are for the first time in their life celebrating Passover with no one else,” Schusterman said Tuesday. Passover, which begins Wednesday and continues until the evening of April 16, is a time when Jews celebrate the ancient Hebrews’ escape from slavery in Egypt and their journey through the desert to the Holy Land, a story chronicled in the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament. The holiday falls in the midst of the Christian Holy Week, and members of that faith also must determine how they will observe Good Friday and Easter Sunday in the midst of stay-at-home orders and Maryland regulations that limit gatherings to 10 people or less during the COVID-19 crisis. Such orders make it very challenging to hold services in houses of worship or community gatherings. Harford Chabad had planned to host a community seder, with some people traveling from Hawaii to attend, but that cannot happen under current restrictions. “That’s actually the message of Passover, is, you have these things that limit you and sometimes you have to do a reset,” Schusterman said. The rabbi noted that he and his family, as well as other Chabad members, have found “silver linings” in the restrictions. He appears in several videos on the Harford Chabad website, giving instructions on how people can prepare for the holiday and the insights they can find in the Passover Haggadah. The website has a full section dedicated to celebrating Passover during coronavirus. One lesson from the rabbi indicates how people can replace “pharaoh” with the word “ego” when discussing the ruler of Egypt who kept Hebrews enslaved and replace Egypt with the phrase “my limitations.” “I’m enslaved to my limitations because my ego has oppressed me, and it makes it a very relevant conversation,” he said regarding how people can process having to remain at home during Passover. Jews might be in their kitchens or dining rooms, holding a Passover seder by themselves, but they are not alone — they are “alone together” with others doing the same thing, according to Schusterman. “They’re really doing it with millions of other Jews who are also doing it alone in their living room,” he said. People also can remember their ancestors or loved ones who have died and are with them in spirit during the seder. “No one is ever alone,” Schusterman said. “God is with them.” The rabbi stressed that Jews are instructed by the Torah to make their health a top priority, so while it might be painful to observe Passover without friends or family, it is the right decision to protect one’s health. “It’s an act of service of God when a person takes care of their health,” he said. Harford Chabad serves about 250 families, and people in Schusterman’s congregation have been observing guidance to slow the spread of coronavirus, which he said is “encouraging.” “God willing, next year we will have a seder with everyone we love and hold close to us,” Schusterman said.

Senior, long-term care facilities in Baltimore region respond to coronavirus outbreak
.W
Ethel Hill is watching the spread of the new coronavirus from the window of her two-bedroom apartment at Vantage House, a senior living community in Columbia. While she may be by herself in her apartment, the 87-year-old is not alone in her current solitary status. With a growing aging population, Howard County is home to 44 different senior living facilities, according to the Howard County Office on Aging and Independence. The older segment of the population is under increasing concern from health care and government officials as the most susceptible to the coronavirus. Howard County reported its first case of coronavirus on Sunday, an 82-year-old woman with an underlying health condition who is a resident at Lorien Health Services’ Elkridge facility. Since then, 15 more people have been diagnosed in the county, bringing its total to 16, and the state total to 107 as of Thursday. According to the 82-year-old woman’s daughter, who asked that her name not be used, her mother is doing well and is “up and talking.” “We have no clue how she got it,” the daughter said. “I was the last outsider to visit my mom. My doctor wouldn’t test me without symptoms; the doctor just said I should self-quarantine.” The woman’s daughter said she’s been in quarantine since Sunday, along with one of her sisters. Now residents at senior facilities across the county are adapting to new rules and restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus and learn from the country’s first outbreak at the Life Care Center nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, with 29 coronavirus-related deaths to date. According to the Howard County Health Department, after the first case was discovered at the Lorien Health Services’ Elkridge facility, staff from the county health department and the Maryland Department of Health visited the building. Staff members “observed infection control measures, and provided further recommendations to mitigate further infection between staff-staff and staff-patients and patient-patient,” the county department said. “We are following [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] protocols and providing Lorien [with] daily and updated guidance,” the department added. According to the Howard County Office on Aging and Independence, there are 24 independent senior and disability housing options; four nursing and rehabilitative care facilities; five small assisted living homes with 16 or fewer residents; and 11 assisted living options with more than 17 residents in the county. Joseph DeMattos, president and CEO of Health Facilities Association of Maryland, represents health care providers at assisted living and nursing facilities across the state, including Lorien Health Services, the site of the first Howard County case. “Sadly we all stand on the shoulders of the experience in Kirkland, Washington. We have a great deal to learn from their experience,” DeMattos said. “We have been actively engaging in COVID-19 preparation since the last week of January.” At a March 10 meeting with Gov. Larry Hogan and leaders from the long-term care community, DeMattos suggested the governor limit visits to senior communities across the state; later that day, Hogan put statewide restrictions in place, including restricting access to essential visits only. For Hill, the mother of state Del. Terri Hill who has lived at Vantage House for nearly three years, that means staying in her apartment and allowing company only into her personal apartment, not into communal spaces at the facility. Hill said when visitors enter the lobby or garage, their temperature gets taken, a precaution she’s happy Vantage House and facilities around the state are taking. “We try to maintain this social distancing,” she said. “When you consider the alternative, I’m OK with it. I’m more concerned about the young people; there’s a certain age group that thinks they won’t get sick.” When Jo Kruger visited her 82-year-old mother in Waterfalls of Catonsville on March 11, she didn’t know it would be the last time she’d see her for the foreseeable future. Kruger’s mother, who was diagnosed with dementia about a decade ago, lives with seven other patients in the memory care facility, which has now closed to visitors. “She knew there was an illness going around; she didn’t realize the severity of it,” Kruger said. During Kruger’s last visit, “I just said, ‘Hopefully I’ll see you tomorrow,’ and I haven’t gone back.” Kruger’s mother used to enjoy socializing during field trips to senior centers in Baltimore and Howard counties, but “that’s no longer happening,” Kruger said. In Baltimore County, where seniors in 2020 make up a quarter of the population, Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. closed the county’s 20 senior centers starting March 16 in response to the pandemic. Still, the Catonsville resident is relieved her mother is in the facility, where “they’re better at taking care of her and keeping things clean.” Ivy Johnson, a certified medication technician at Waterfalls of Catonsville, said the center is doing its due diligence in cleaning surfaces and encouraging residents to wash their hands frequently. Kruger, who can reach her mother by phone, said the older woman is going “a little stir-crazy," but the news coverage “is so constant she can remember what’s going on.” Kruger said her mom will ask what precautions she needs to take and what it’s like in grocery stores. Kruger assures her that the restrictions could last “a couple more weeks, and we’ll be able to get on with our normal lives." As the primary caregiver for her 82-year-old mother, Flora Betro plans to visit Lutheran Village at Miller’s Grant in Ellicott City once a week to assist with her mother’s medications. While the facility is allowing primary caregivers daily access, Betro decided to take precautions, including working from home and limiting activities in an effort to prevent herself from becoming a carrier and possibly infecting her mother. Movement within the facility, however, is even more restricted, according to David Pardoe, 81, and Elaine Pardoe, 80, who have lived in the community for four years. Monday night was the last time the couple dined at The Pub, one of the facility’s three dining options. Residents are now placing meal orders, putting an order form on their doorstep each morning and getting dinner delivered each afternoon. “We just miss getting together with our friends,” Elaine Pardoe said. “There’s no sense in being nervous in it. Heck, we’re 80; we’ve seen a lot.” Andy Lunt, 75, another resident at Lutheran Village at Miller’s Grant, said the biggest disadvantage is losing the community interaction. “The greatest benefit for being [at Lutheran Village at Miller’s Grant] is the community, the interaction with other people,” Lunt said. “We tend to be with people much of the day.” Lunt said he feels safer in the community because the policies put in place limit outside interaction. “We’re in a somewhat protected environment,” Lunt said. “The policies in place would limit the spread if a case did occur here. We feel we’re in a good place during this situation, no matter how long it lasts.”

Baltimore City Council cancels meetings until at least April due to coronavirus outbreak
.W
Baltimore City Council will cancel its meetings until at least April in response to the new coronavirus outbreak, Council President Brandon Scott announced Thursday. City Council had continued to meet regularly in spite of the virus, which was first confirmed March 5 in Maryland. Since then, the disease has continued to spread, sickening at least 107 people across the state, including eight in Baltimore City. It claimed the life of a Prince George’s County man Wednesday. Baltimore City Council last met March 9, and was next scheduled to meet Monday. Scott said that meeting will be delayed until at least April 6. “As Council president, I have a duty to keep our members and the public safe,” the Democrat said in a news release. “At this time, we must do the responsible thing and cancel Monday’s meeting. My office will continue working towards a virtual alternative that will allow our members and Baltimore residents to participate remotely.” Scott said his office is working on a system to hold virtual council meetings that would adhere to the Open Meetings Act, which requires the opportunity for the public to participate in a governing body’s meetings. Scott said he was mindful some city residents do not have reliable access to the internet or television. “We’re going to go back to work on April 6,” Scott said Thursday, “but we have to make sure we’re keeping people safe. Safety comes first.” All council hearings scheduled for March also have been canceled. The council was slated to take a final vote at next week’s meeting on several charter amendments, including one that would reduce the number of votes needed to override a mayoral veto from three-fourths of the council to two-thirds. The city’s Board of Estimates, which approves all city purchases, contracts and settlements, has continued to meet weekly, but has encouraged the public to watch via livestream rather than attend in person. Every other seat in the board’s meeting room has been left empty to prevent people from sitting next to one another. Representatives from Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the council announcement. Baltimore historian Matthew Crenson said he believes it has been more than 150 years since the city was forced to suspend a portion of its elected government. That was during the Civil War, when Union forces occupied the city and had Mayor George Brown arrested and removed from office. John Chapman, the former council president, ascended to the mayor’s office at the time, but Crenson said he’s found no evidence that City Council was meeting. The council would have been required to swear an oath to the Union, he said, which most of the board would not have done. “They were paralyzed," he said. “My suspicion is they didn’t meet.”

Carroll County schools officials surveying families in case coronavirus-related closure stretches longer
.W
Carroll County Public Schools sent an email to families Thursday asking for feedback to prepare in case the school closures, initially set at two weeks in response to the coronavirus, stretch longer — something the superintendent is predicting. The “Computer Internet Survey” email to parents Thursday read, “We have anticipated there could be changes to the duration of time schools could stay closed. We have been working around the clock to best prepare for the possibility of distance learning for a longer duration of time.” Maryland’s top education official ordered all public schools to close for two weeks beginning March 16 in response to the spreading coronavirus known by the disease it causes, COVID-19. CCPS pledged to communicate with families about any plans to continue the semester remotely. The survey asks what internet access and devices students have available at home. “This will allow us to finalize resources and supports where access or a device is not available to a student,” the email states. Superintendent Steve Lockard said in an interview that CCPS is awaiting a decision from the state, but “If you just ask me,” he believes the closure will be extended. Lockard said that CCPS can’t wait for an initial announcement to plan and prepare for virtual learning and they have been doing so steadily over the past few weeks. It’s been a “significant lift” for the system to achieve, but helped by the fact that CCPS was already working toward expanding virtual learning. It was “an area in the system that needed to grow," but in the case of the pandemic, the pace “exponentially increases,” he said. The survey was first sent out by email Thursday afternoon and will be sent again the next day, Lockard said. The vast majority of CCPS families have access to email, he said. School principals will likely start reaching out by phone on March 24 to families who haven’t responded by then. In the first two hours after the survey was sent, CCPS received about 10,000 responses, Lockard said. CCPS has about 25,000 students in the system, and many of those may be siblings who received one survey for the household. During the closure, the school system has offered meals for all 18 and younger, regardless of whether they are enrolled in CCPS. The Emergency Meal Distribution program now offers breakfast, lunch and dinner. It operates Monday through Friday, and children must be present to receive the meals.

Hotel in Pikesville cancels reservation of Yeshiva basketball team over coronavirus fears, coach says
.W
A hotel in a Baltimore suburb on Thursday canceled the reservation of the Yeshiva University men’s basketball team over fears of the novel coronavirus, the coach of the Maccabees told The Associated Press. Coach Elliot Steinmetz said the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Pikesville canceled the reservation, forcing the team to book rooms at a different hotel. A student at the Orthodox Jewish university has tested positive for the virus. “I made it very clear to the hotel that it's discrimination,” Steinmetz said. “I basically said to them: `Do you have a checkbox on your website that says that you've been in an area with suspected coronavirus?' And they said no. So I said: `Is it just for the guests of Yeshiva University?' And they said yes. I told them that that's called discrimination.” Hilton spokeswoman Laura Ford said the hotel in Pikesville is an independently owned and operated property. Hotel management did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The team is scheduled to play Worcester Polytechnic Institute Friday in the first round of the NCAA Division III basketball tournament at Johns Hopkins. The winner would advance to play the winner of the later Friday game between Johns Hopkins and Penn State Harrisburg on Saturday in Baltimore. NCAA spokesman Bob Williams told the AP on Thursday afternoon that the games were set to be played as scheduled. Johns Hopkins athletic department spokeswoman Jill Guise also said no plans had changed for Friday’s games. But Maryland health officials on Thursday night confirmed the state’s first three cases of the coronavirus. And late Thursday night Hopkins officials announced that they had decided to ban fans from attending the first and second rounds. “In light of Maryland’s recently confirmed cases of COVID-19, and based on CDC guidance for large gatherings, we have determined that it is prudent to hold this tournament without spectators,” the university announced. “We are not making any determination about other JHU events at this time; while we await further guidance from public health authorities, we will be assessing large events on a case-by-case basis. We regret any inconvenience to the families and fans of the players.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday that the wife, two children and a neighbor of a New York lawyer who is hospitalized in critical condition with COVID-19 have also tested positive for the disease. One of the lawyer's children is a student at Yeshiva University. The family and the neighbor have been self-quarantined at home. The institution has canceled classes at its upper Manhattan campus. Josh Joseph, the university's senior vice president, said the infected student is not a member of the basketball team, has not participated in any team events and has not been on campus since Feb. 27. He added that the New York City Department of Health has “cleared” the team to participate in the tournament. The best team in the school’s history won the Skyline Conference title on Sunday, its second conference championship in three years, to qualify for the NCAA Division III tournament. The Maccabees have won 27 straight games.

Baltimore police, fire departments working to prepare for increases in coronavirus cases 
.W
The Baltimore police and fire departments, like agencies across the country, are preparing for additional cases of the coronavirus that are likely to arise, including contingencies for if their own rank-and-file become infected with the disease. “We are taking additional precautions as needed if responders need to be quarantined,” police spokeswoman Lindsey Eldridge said in a statement. “The city is looking at all contingencies to include adding additional personnel if needed. This creates an intentional protection effort – as we all continue to practice safety precautions surrounding COVID-19.” Additionally, she said the police and fire agencies are working with the Department of General Services to increase disinfecting at facilities, and are distributing personal protective equipment to officers and firefighters. Last week, the department distributed a memo and a video from Police Commissioner Michael Harrison asking for officers to take additional measures to stay safe. Baltimore’s 911 operators are questioning callers to screen for any potential exposure to the COVID-19 virus, and the department has ordered additional personal protective equipment, such as face masks, for officers who must interact with a person possibly exposed to the virus. “Keeping every member of our department safe and knowledgeable of operating procedure remains my highest priority,” Harrison said in the video. He also said he’s been speaking with department leaders across the country to ensure the department is using best practices. Ken Thompson, the head of the team monitoring the department’s consent decree compliance, said coronavirus concerns have resulted in the department stopping in-service training on how to handle stops, searches, and the arrest policy that all officers must be trained. “It’s really the most critical," Thompson said. “That is where the police and the public have the most engagement.” But Thompson said training for recruits at the academy is continuing with additional precautions. He said the work of the monitoring team, such as evaluating department use of force and internal affairs data, is continuing. Eight officers were sent home to quarantine Friday after an arrestee claimed he had tested positive for the coronavirus to avoid going to jail. The man tested negative, however, and the officers were able to return to work. As of Wednesday, Baltimore had at least five confirmed cases of COVID-19, with evidence of community transmission. The state has reported 85 cases. The pandemic comes as the department is trying to rebuild its force, which is currently short about 350 officers. Baltimore Police have been trying to beef up recruiting and retaining more officers, but also finding ways to reduce the workload for officers, such as encouraging residents with non-emergency calls to file reports online. In response to the outbreak, some departments elsewhere have announced more drastic measures. Los Angeles Police, for example, are moving half of all detectives to patrol to help respond to calls, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has begun citing and releasing more people for less serious charges to avoid housing them in the local jail, according to the Los Angeles Times. Other departments have announced additional measures to reduce officers’ possible exposure. Police in Denver and Aurora, Colo. are no longer sending officers to low-level crimes, according to the Denver Post newspaper. Seattle Police have closed its headquarters and local precincts to the public to avoid exposure. A 2007 report by the Police Executive Research Forum, which studies and identifies best practices for policing offered recommendations to departments, including preparing plans to address the possibility of losing personnel. Officers are projected to have higher rates of infections “because of the nature of their work,” the report said. The report said that among “jurisdictions affected by past flu pandemics, between 25 and 35 percent of the population was infected.” As other public gatherings have been forced to cancel because of the outbreak, the monitoring team canceled its upcoming community meeting, and Thompson said the federal judge enforcing the consent decree will have to determine whether to postpone an upcoming public hearing before the court. The police department also had to cancel two upcoming meetings scheduled for this month on the controversial surveillance plane program.

Harford County closing senior centers starting Friday to prevent spread of coronavirus
.W
Harford County’s senior centers have been ordered to close starting Friday until further notice as a precaution to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus among older adults. While a majority of people recover from the virus, adults age 60 and older and those with pre-existing medical conditions have a greater risk for serious illness, according to the Maryland Department of Health. “Public health officials tell us that seniors are more vulnerable to coronavirus, so we are taking this step to reduce their chances of infection and to keep them safe,” County Executive Barry Glassman said in a prepared statement. “We continue to encourage all of our residents to stay calm and stay informed through our state and local health departments and other reliable sources.” County government said there has been no indication of coronavirus infection at any of its four senior centers, located in Edgewood, Havre de Grace, Bel Air and Fallston. After 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, the facilities are used as activity centers for people of all ages. They will continue to operate normally in that capacity at this time, said Cindy Mumby, a spokeswoman for the county. Earlier this week, officials announced an 86-year-old Harford woman tested positive for the virus after traveling overseas. Health officials said they did not believe the woman, who was hospitalized, posed a risk to the community at-large. There are 1,215 reported cases in the U.S., according to the CDC — 12 of which are in Maryland, including the state’s first case unrelated to travel, which Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday. Seniors who have a critical concern caused by the closure of their center can contact the Office on Aging at 410-638-3025. If closures impact classes starting on March 30, more information will be posted on the Office on Aging’s website as decisions are made.

Baltimore faces $42.3 million deficit as the coronavirus pandemic upends economic activity 
.W
Baltimore officials expect to end the fiscal year with a $42.3 million deficit as the coronavirus pandemic slows economic activity to a crawl. With fewer people driving, the city is collecting less money from parking meters and cameras that record traffic violations. With fewer people traveling, revenue tied to tourism is plummeting, meaning less coming in from hotel taxes. And with fewer people working, income tax revenue is expected to be down, too. “We’re facing a very tough budget outlook,” Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said this week. Under normal circumstances, members of Young’s administration would have spent Wednesday morning explaining the preliminary budget to Baltimore’s Board of Estimates. But the proposal his administration has spent months preparing has become “largely irrelevant,” said budget director Bob Cenname, as the city stares down the public health crisis and the resulting widespread economic uncertainty. Cenname used Wednesday’s meeting to brief the spending panel on the city’s fiscal outlook, and warned its members that city staff will have to almost completely retool the proposed budget before they finalize it in early May. He projected the city will bring in about $100 million less in revenue than anticipated for the fiscal year that begins in July. “Everything has to be on the table because of the size of the shortfall,” Cenname said in a conference call with reporters. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, Baltimore was gearing up for a challenging budget season. Young had instructed all agencies to plan to cut costs 5% by 2022 in anticipation of an expensive statewide plan to improve public schools that each locality must contribute to. That mandate — issued before the world had been introduced to the COVID-19 disease — now seems insufficient and out of date. Such a move would’ve freed up only about $70 million. With city officials eyeing the pandemic’s possible effects earlier this month, Young announced some measures intended to blunt the economic impact. The city instituted a freeze on nonessential hiring and spending, with an exemption for police officers, paramedics, firefighters and other public safety workers. Agencies can request other exemptions for positions that provide “direct essential services" or generate revenue, Finance Director Henry Raymond wrote in a March 20 memo to fiscal officers. “Even if the health risk passes, most economists believe that the economy will suffer for many months or even years with minimal growth and lower employment levels,” he wrote. More than 5,000 people in Baltimore recently filed for unemployment. Young said Wednesday that he hasn’t contemplated laying off city employees, but cautioned that “if we don’t have revenue, everything has to be on the table.” He repeated his call for Republican President Donald Trump to boost the amount of federal money flowing to cities like Baltimore as local governments grapple with the economic consequences of the pandemic. “I personally don’t want to see layoffs, but if the budget dictates that, we have no other choice unless our president sends us some relief,” Young said. Before the pandemic hit, Baltimore forecast a $26.4 million surplus in its general fund. Now, it’s projecting a $68.7 million decline in revenues by the end of the fiscal year. Cenname expects expenditures will remain essentially flat. While the city has so far incurred about $3 million in emergency expenses — for costs such as public health messaging, protective gear and premium pay for some employees — it is saving money by cutting back on “nonessential” spending. The Department of Public Works, for example, suspended bulk trash pickup and graffiti removal. “Because we have such rapidly declining revenues, we want to make sure we’re only spending on what is absolutely essential,” Cenname said. The preliminary budget is due May 6 to the Board of Estimates, which must approve it before it goes to the City Council. “It’s too early to talk about what the revisions will be or what the reductions will be in the budget,” Cenname said, but officials will have to make "really tough choices about how we’ll balance in 2021.” Getting public input on the budget also will be a challenge, given that Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has instituted a “stay-at-home” order to stop the spread of the highly contagious virus. The city is expected to hold a virtual “Taxpayers Night” on April 7, during which residents will hear a presentation from Cenname and can testify by calling in to a video conference. Residents can view the forum by going to bit.ly/TaxpayersNight. They can also dial in to 408-418-9388, using access code 719 116 074. People can sign up to give testimony at bit.ly/BOETestimony​ or email their thoughts to budget@baltimorecity.gov.

Maryland universities expanding use of pass-fail grading, citing challenges amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
With all in-person classes canceled as a result of coronavirus precautions, universities in Maryland are expanding the use of pass-fail grading for undergraduates for the spring 2020 term. The University of Maryland, College Park; the Johns Hopkins University; the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Towson University are amending their normal grading policies to account for a historically unusual spring semester. Colleges and universities in the state have ceased in-person classes for the rest of the school year due to restrictions against crowds of 10 or more, an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus that has been confirmed in nearly 1,000 Marylanders and has killed 10 as of Saturday. All University of Maryland undergraduate courses in spring 2020 will be graded pass/fail unless the student elects to receive an earned grade for the course, according to Mary Ann Rankin, provost and senior vice president. “Pass” grades do not contribute to students’ grade point averages, but “fail” grades, do, Rankin said in a letter to students, faculty and staff. Students should confer with their advisers about their individual situations, the provost said. “A note will be included on student transcripts indicating the unusual circumstances prevailing in spring 2020,” she wrote. Recognizing the challenges of remote learning “are not evenly felt by all students,” two of Hopkins’ largest schools, the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and the Whiting School of Engineering, are adopting satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading this semester for their undergraduates, according to Sunil Kumar, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. The deans of the university’s other schools will decide whether to opt in to the pass-fail system and announce those decisions directly to their schools’ students and faculty, he said. “With the significant disruption to our way of life and academic and societal norms, it is keenly important that we take a holistic view in determining how best to measure academic performance,” Kumar said in a letter posted to the university’s website Friday. “All of the changes are based on the common recognition that we must provide greater accommodations to our students in this unusual and disrupted semester.” The Hopkins provost expressed gratitude to the university community “for showing flexibility, humanity, and resolve over the past several weeks.” For many Hopkins students, receiving a pass or fail grade after a semester of learning “may seem antithetical to our nature as achievers,” Kumar wrote. “We believe our divisions have adopted approaches that best maximize equitability and meet the needs of each student body in this unique time,” he wrote. Hopkins is focused on ensuring its students, faculty and staff can finish the semester “with the least amount of disruption possible,” the Hopkins provost’s letter said. UMBC is encouraging its students to wait until after the final Spring 2020 grades are posted on May 27 to decide whether to request a change to a pass/fail grade and before making the decision to withdraw from a course or from the entire semester, the university said on its website. “We hope that by offering this flexibility, students will be able to adjust to their new academic environment and focus on doing well in their coursework to successfully complete the Spring 2020 semester without the need to withdraw,” UMBC said. Towson is allowing students the option of whether to be graded pass-fail or on the normal letter scale, “in consideration of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the spring 2020 semester and the rapid shift to a distance education format,” the university said on its website. “Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisor to discuss possible academic implications prior to electing the Pass Grading Option or withdrawing from a course,” the university stated. More than 664,000 people worldwide are known to have contracted the acute respiratory disease as of Saturday night, and more than 30,000 have died, according to Hopkins.

Seven new coronavirus cases confirmed in Maryland, bringing total number to 19
.W
Seven more people in Maryland have tested positive for the new coronavirus, bringing the state’s total number of confirmed cases to 19, officials said Friday. The new cases were announced piecemeal with five announced Friday morning in a tweet from Mike Ricci, spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan. They included a new case in Baltimore County, another in Anne Arundel County, two in Prince George’s County and one in Charles County Another was confirmed by Carroll County a few hours later. And Prince George’s County announced a third for the day Friday evening. The news of the new cases followed Hogan’s announcement Thursday of a slew of measures in Maryland — including a two-week closure of schools that will affect nearly a million students — intended to contain the spread of COVID-19. The disease has sickened at least 130,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,000. More than 1,200 people in the U.S. have been confirmed to have the disease, and that number is expected to increase as access to testing is expanded. Friday marked a shift in how the cases are announced in Maryland. Previously, cases were announced by the governor’s office and state health officials. Now it appears local health departments will confirm positive tests. Ricci and state health officials offered no further information about the cases he announced. Baltimore County spokesman Sean Naron did not respond to requests for further details on the new Baltimore County case. The new case marks Baltimore County’s second, after a man in his 60s, who worked at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington, was diagnosed. The Anne Arundel County case is its first, though a Montana woman who lives part-time in Anne Arundel was sickened and diagnosed in the county. Her case, however, is counted by Montana. The new Anne Arundel patient, who is in their 60s, is believed to have contracted the virus while traveling abroad and is recovering at home, county officials said. The person with the coronavirus in Charles County is a dependent of a military retiree who has been self-quarantined at home since testing positive Wednesday at a clinic on Joint Base Andrews, the U.S. Air Force’s 11th Wing announced Friday in a news release. The person had cold-like symptoms and had recently traveled to South Korea and the Philippines. Ed Singer, the Carroll County health officer, said its case involves a man in his 40s who has “very mild symptoms" and is recovering at home. The man had not traveled abroad. County health officials are working with the state to trace his contacts and identify anyone he might have contacted. The latest Prince George’s cases are all different. One is a man in his 40s, who was exposed to the county’s first patient, a woman who contracted COVID-19 while on a Nile River cruise in Egypt, according to a release from County Executive Angela Alsobrooks. The other announced by Ricci earlier in the day is a female in her 30s and her case is currently under investigation, the county said. The case announced late Friday is a man in his 50s, who has a connection with that woman. He is currently hospitalized out-of-state, where he tested positive, officials said. Due to federal health privacy laws, officials limit identifying information about patients. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and, in more severe cases, pneumonia. Most people who are infected show mild or moderate symptoms, and older people and those with preexisting medical conditions are at a greater risk for more serious illness. To limit its spread, health officials are asking people to wash their hands often and practice “social distancing," keeping themselves at least 6 feet from one another. Officials also are discouraging travel and large gatherings. Acting Thursday in the wake of Maryland’s first case of the virus spreading within the community rather than from travel, Hogan directed senior centers to close and prohibited gatherings of more than 250 people. The unprecedented school closure is leaving administrators rushing to prepare plans to feed and continue educating students. Hogan also closed the cruise ship terminal at the Port of Baltimore, activated the National Guard, suspended visitors from state prisons and ordered nonessential state employees to telework, if possible. Baltimore Sun Media’s Dan Rodricks, Mary Grace Keller and Olivia Sanchez contributed to this article.

Maryland college, high school athletics officials preparing for coronavirus, but not changing travel plans yet
.W
The growing concern surrounding the worldwide coronavirus outbreak has not affected the athletic programs for some of the largest colleges and universities in Maryland and prominent high schools in the Baltimore metropolitan area — yet. While there are no confirmed cases of the disease — known as COVID-19 — in Maryland, state and county public health agencies have strongly cautioned that there will be more cases in the United States. And educational systems throughout the state are closely monitoring the situation, which has radiated worldwide since initially being diagnosed in Wuhan City in the Hubei Province of China. Thus far, no college or university athletic departments have changed their teams’ schedules or travel plans because of the coronavirus. Spokespeople associated with the departments at the University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins, Towson, UMBC, Morgan State, Loyola Maryland and Coppin State said that although plans could change in the future if an outbreak occurs, it is pretty much status quo for their athletic teams. “We are working closely with the health and emergency authorities on campus to monitor and respond to this situation as it rapidly develops,” UMBC athletic director Brian Barrio said in a written statement. “As of now, teams have not been advised to significantly alter travel or operational plans — but as events warrant, we will take any and all necessary measures to protect our student-athletes and to help mitigate the spread of the virus in our community. The current message is essentially — do not contribute to any panic about this, wash your hands frequently, stay home if you develop even mild, flu-like symptoms, and follow all directions from our health services professionals.” Added Johns Hopkins athletic director Jennifer S. Baker: “We are closely monitoring the situation as it relates to athletics and athletic-related travel. To date, there has been no disruption in our team schedules, activities or travel. We will continue to follow guidance from public health officials, the University, Centennial Conference, Big Ten and NCAA to ensure we are acting with the health, welfare and safety of our student-athletes, coaches and staff in mind.” Athletic department spokesmen for the University of Maryland and Loyola referred inquiries to websites managed by the respective schools that updates their students, faculty and administration of any news regarding the coronavirus. A spokesman for Coppin State shared a letter from interim president Mickey L. Burnim distributed Feb. 26 in which he said the school is developing plans to continue instruction in the event of an outbreak and/or quarantine. Several spokespeople said the schools are placing an emphasis on attacking high-traffic areas that involve touching of common items. Training and weight rooms have been disinfected daily, more hand sanitizer stations are cropping up in hallways and outside classrooms, and more signs recommending vigorous hand washing have been posted inside and outside of public restrooms. “Internally, we are making Public announcements at contests about prevention during flu season and have stationed hand sanitizers throughout our venues,” Morgan State athletic director Edward Scott said in a written statement. At the high school level, precautions about coronavirus are starting to be discussed. On Sunday, Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association executive director Lee Dove addressed concerns from some league members about pre- and post-game handshakes during the spring season, stating via email that the league will always support and expect this expression of sportsmanship, but will also pay close attention to the stated protocols by public health agencies across the state as the concerns continue to evolve. The Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland Conference is having a board meeting Thursday to discuss the topic, and executive director Sue Thompson will follow up with the schools’ athletic directors next Tuesday. The Maryland Pubic Secondary Schools Athletic Association is in the midst of its winter playoffs, and events have proceeded as planned. The public schools have been following the guidance of the Maryland Department of Health.

Aberdeen Proving Ground confirms second coronavirus case amid stepped-up countermeasures
.W
Two employees at Aberdeen Proving Ground tested positive for the novel coronavirus that is sweeping across Maryland and the world, according to posts made to the base’s Facebook page. In response to the virus, the base will be “limiting all travel, in-person meetings, and other gatherings, as well as reducing on-post services and maximizing telework,” among other steps taken to reduce the spread of the virus, the post states. One employee, who was not identified further, worked in a secure facility on APG North, and had not been into the office since March 16, according to a Friday Facebook post. The person had traveled to New York the weekend before March 16 and was tested for COVID-19 because of their age, health and recent travel. The person did not show symptoms and has since been put in isolation, the post states. On Tuesday, the base posted that a second suspected case of coronavirus was confirmed of two other suspected cases. The other suspected case came back negative. The person who tested positive was also not identified, but was last in building 6010 on March 13. They were tested on March 18 when they began to feel ill. All people who were in close contact with the second person to test positive have been on self-quarantine since March 18, the post states. None has shown positive signs at this time, and the majority of the contact areas have been cleaned, the post states. APG North’s barbershop has also temporarily been shut down after two employees reportedly had contact March 13 with a person who tested positive on Sunday, the post states. “Out of an abundance of caution, I have directed the shop to close for 14 days and an immediate thorough cleaning of the facility. We are running trace operations now and will provide an update on results when they become available,” the post attributed to Maj. Gen. Mitchell L. Kilgo states. The first employee was a resident of Delaware, according to Harford County Government spokeswoman Cindy Mumby, so the individual will not show up in state or county data reported by the Maryland Department of Health. As of Tuesday morning, the state was reporting 349 confirmed cases in Maryland, including five in Harford County. APG officials did not return requests for comment. The Army installation is Harford County’s largest employer, accounting for more than 21,000 military, civilian and contractor jobs, to APG’s website. The building where the first person tested positive for COVID-19 was mostly empty as many employees were working remotely, according to APG’s social media post, but it is being cleaned. Officials are working to trace who the people had contact with to contain any potential spread of the virus. The posts noted that the base would be stepping up its preventative measures — steps outlined in the Army’s Health Protection Condition (HPCON) level, which details specific actions the base takes to prevent the spread of disease — but the countermeasures were heightened even more Monday. Though the HPCON level changed on the base, Garrison Commander Col. Tim Druell, in a video message posted to social media on Monday, said the effect on APG has been minimal. The base was already exercising stricter viral countermeasures than recommended, including asking personnel to work home and limiting in-person meetings and travel, he said. Military personnel will remain in the local commuting area, and civilian employees are encouraged to stay in the area, the post states. APG’s Chaplin Services is offering food basket delivery for soldiers, civilians, retirees and families living on post and under quarantine as well as counseling services, the post states. The base also closed its child-care facilities except to those deemed key and essential, like medical workers, the post states. Druell recommended people working on the base stay home when they are sick, wash their hands frequently and report sickness to their supervisors, consistent with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s advice. He also advised workers to wipe down their computers and workstations. The stepped-up preventative measures at APG come after Maryland shut all non-essential businesses and was preparing to build on-the-fly hospitals to address the viral pandemic, which has sickened at least 349 Marylanders and killed four as of Tuesday. Five cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Harford County, according to data from the Maryland Department of Health. On Monday, Mumby said the latest case was a 59-year-old male who had traveled out of state, who was tested after reporting symptoms and is now self-isolating. It’s unclear whether that is the fifth case listed by the state or if it is 55-year-old man reported by the state Friday, but whom officials now believe was an address error by a private lab. The four other Harford cases include an 86-year-old woman who contracted the virus traveling overseas and is hospitalized and a 69-year-old family member of hers, who is isolated at home, a 47-year-old man who lives in Harford but is working in Boston and was tested and is self-isolating there, and a 44-year-old woman who is stable and isolated at home.

Pearl Jam cancels first leg of tour, including Baltimore show, amid coronavirus concerns
.W
As the number of people who contract coronavirus continues to climb, popular rock band Pearl Jam announced Monday night that it is canceling the first leg of its tour. The band was expected to play March 28 at Baltimore’s Royal Farms Arena. But the band said it is following public health officials’ recommendations and avoiding public gatherings by canceling the first leg of the tour, a statement on its website said. “Unfortunately, communing in large groups is a huge part of what we do as a band and the tour we’ve been busy planning for months is now in jeopardy,” the band said. “We have and will always keep the safety and well-being of our supporters as top priority.” The Seattle-based band also said it has seen firsthand how the novel disease is escalating, with their children’s schools closing along with universities and businesses. “We’ve worked hard with all our management and business associates to find other solutions or options but the levels of risk to our audience and their communities is simply too high for our comfort level,” the band said. No dates have been rescheduled yet, but the band said ticketing website Ticketmaster will be in touch with buyers soon and that previously purchased tickets will be honored for the new dates. Maryland has six confirmed cases of the coronavirus. There are more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19 globally and more than 500 in the United States in 34 states. The state of Washington has had 22 deaths, most of them in the Seattle area.

Howard schools, Howard Community College respond to state-mandated, two-week closure amid coronavirus concerns
.W
The Howard County Public School System will not let their students go hungry during the state-mandated emergency school closings for the next two weeks as the new coronavirus continues to spread throughout Maryland. All 77 county schools will close Monday through March 27. All school buildings will close at 6 p.m. Friday. The school system will provide free “Grab-N-Go” items, nutritious meals to anyone younger than age 18, beginning Tuesday. The meals will be available from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at four school sites and five mobile sites through March 27, excluding weekends. There will also be “Grab-N-Go” breakfast items available. State schools Superintendent Karen Salmon said Thursday afternoon the statewide public school closure was a critical move. “It is crucial that we take immediate measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,” Salmon said, with 12 coronavirus cases confirmed in the state as of Thursday night. Public schools and buses will be cleaned and a plan is in development to provide meals to children in need, Salmon said. “I support the action wholeheartedly … it is my hope this decision minimizes the risk for our communities,” Howard schools Superintendent Martirano said during Thursday’s abbreviated Board of Education meeting. “The health and safety of the Howard County public school students, the staff [and] the community remain our top concern,” Martirano added. “It is important that families remain home as much as possible, as social distancing is the primary reason behind this unprecedented decision.” Students will be provided with information and instructional resources regarding remote learning on Friday. Online copies of the resources are available on the school system’s website, and paper documents will be sent home Friday. The online resources will not be collected or graded, according to a news release. Students can continue working on classroom assignments assigned prior to the closure; however, there are no expectations for the assignments to be turned in during the mandated closure. All Friday after-school activities included athletics, plays and concerts are canceled. The Saturday SAT exam is also canceled. All community activities scheduled in school buildings through March 27 are canceled. Students should clean out their lockers, including gym lockers. School nurses and health assistants will contact families, asking them to pick up their students’ medication and health supplies by the end of the school day Friday. Salmon also recommended that spring break days be used for instruction to make up for this break. Howard schools’ spring break is scheduled for April 6 through 13. The school system is reviewing the recommendation and will provide additional information as soon as possible. In response to the statewide public school closure, Howard Community College is also taking steps to monitor the rapidly evolving spread of coronavirus. The college’s spring break is being rescheduled from April 6 through 12 to March 16 through 22. The following week, until March 29, all credit and noncredit classes are canceled. More information about the second week will follow. On Thursday morning, the school system canceled the upcoming weekend Future Business Leaders of America field trip to Baltimore. Howard’s countywide middle school debate scheduled for Friday at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory has also been canceled. The lab in Laurel has canceled all events for external organizations until further notice. Martirano on Tuesday canceled all out-of-state field trips and athletic events, including those in Washington, D.C., through the end of the school year. All official out-of-state travel for school system employees also is canceled.

Baltimore officials: No coronavirus cases in the city, mayor’s annual address postponed
.W
Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young confirmed Wednesday there are still no known cases of the new coronavirus in the city, but said preparing for a potential outbreak of the illness is his administration’s “top priority.” He is postponing the mayor’s annual State of the City address, which was scheduled for March 23 at Coppin State University, in light of COVID-19 concerns, and instructed all agency heads to put together plans for continuing their work should the virus show up in Baltimore. Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa said she was “not at liberty to say" how many people in the city are being tested for the illness. She also said there is not a threshold of positive cases that would automatically trigger the widespread closings and quarantines seen in other cities across the world. Young’s cabinet members have been working closely to monitor the illness, he said. He brought several together Wednesday for his weekly news briefing. Baltimore schools CEO Sonja Santelises said the district is encouraging families with children who get sick with anything to keep them at home. The school system has stepped up maintenance efforts, including ordering supplies so teachers and administrators who don’t have soap in their buildings can request that from headquarters. “We will deploy some of our operations teams to make sure that all schools, particularly those with low supplies at this point of the year, have access to soap and gloves and other disinfecting agents,” Santelises said. Several Maryland universities have cancelled classes in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Santelises said large colleges have different considerations than an urban school district such as Baltimore’s. “It’s important for the public to understand that the dynamics of a university system — the size of the University of Maryland — with young adults and faculty in residence — is a very different setting than K-12 buildings that are by in large emptied every day and cleaned regularly,” she said. Should the district have to close, Santelises said the district will ensure the thousands of children who rely on free breakfast and lunch at school will still have access to those meals. Baltimore Fire Chief Niles R. Ford urged residents to only call 911 in emergencies. Residents can call 211 to get the latest updates on the coronavirus. “If people use the [911] system in an improper way, as we evolve into what we could possibly evolve into, they could exacerbate our system," Ford said. The city is also considering relaxing its leave policies and allowing telework should “social distancing” measures becomes more necessary to reduce the spread of the disease. Democratic City Council President Brandon Scott said he doesn’t think it’s necessary yet to consider closing government meetings to the public, but his office has stepped up its efforts to livestream hearings so people can watch from home, if they’re not comfortable being around large groups of people.

Howard schools’ upcoming Baltimore, Johns Hopkins APL field trips canceled due to coronavirus outbreak
.W
The Howard County Public School System has canceled the upcoming weekend Future Business Leaders of America field trip to Baltimore due to concerns related to the new coronavirus, according to emails sent Wednesday by various county high schools. The school system was not sponsoring the FBLA field trip, an email sent to River Hill High School’s community said. If a student or parent decides to attend the trip “as a private, personal decision, they will assume full and complete responsibility for the health and safety of the student and for any individuals who accompany the student,” the email states. Howard’s countywide middle school debate scheduled for Friday at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory has been canceled. The lab in Laurel has canceled all events for external organizations until further notice. On Tuesday, Howard schools Superintendent Michael Martirano canceled all out-of-state field trips and athletic events, including those in Washington, D.C., through the end of the school year. All official out-of-state travel for school system employees also is canceled. Already approved in-state field trips are being reassessed on a case-by-case basis. The school system “is not responsible for any financial loss related to the cancellation of a field trip; however, please know that our staff is working diligently with our vendors over the next several days to attempt to secure refunds for canceled field trips,” according to its website. Howard schools cannot provide refunds without receiving refunds from individual vendors. The county also this week announced the suspension of all out-of-state travel for county employees until at least mid-April due to coronavirus. There are 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Maryland, state officials confirmed Wednesday night. The cases are in Baltimore, Montgomery, Prince George’s and Harford counties. A part-time Anne Arundel resident in her 70s also tested positive for coronavirus Wednesday. The woman lives part-time in Montana, and the case will be assigned to that state.

Lidl opens Cecil County distribution center early to meet ‘surging’ demand for food amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
German grocer Lidl accelerated the opening of its Cecil County distribution center and regional headquarters to meet “surging” demand for food and household products during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the company announced. The 700,000 square-foot facility located along Route 40 in Perryville opened Monday, said Chandler Ebeier, a spokesperson for the company’s U.S. branch, and currently employs more than 150 people, but there are plans to hire over 200 workers as it ramps up. “We pulled the grand opening of our fully-built Cecil County distribution center up by several weeks to further support our stores during this public health emergency, and it officially opened on Monday morning of this week,” Ebeier wrote in an email. The distribution center services stores in five states: Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Johannes Fieber, the CEO of the company’s U.S. operation, thanked Gov. Larry Hogan for supporting the project, in which Lidl invested more than $100 million. “The facility will allow us to efficiently deliver our award-winning products to thousands of customers from Maryland to New York and support our expansion across the region,” Fieber said in a statement. Hogan, in the statement, thanked Lidl for stepping in to address a high demand for food in the state and lauded the company’s health insurance offerings. Lidl U.S. offers employees enrolled in company health insurance plans benefits covering testing and treatment of COVID-19 and provides benefits to full- and part-time employees regardless of the number of hours worked, according to a news release. The company’s American branch is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. Lidl sells products in over 95 stores across nine east coast states, the release states, and runs 11,000 stores globally, employing 287,000 people in total. Lidl has six stores in Maryland, including locations in Aberdeen, Perry Hall and Catonsville.

Maryland schools to remain closed for the rest of academic year due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
Maryland’s public school students will not return to classrooms for the rest of the academic year, officials announced Wednesday, making it one of the last states in the nation to make the call during the coronavirus pandemic. Online and distance learning will continue while the State Department of Education readies a comprehensive long-term recovery plan called “Maryland Together: Recovery Plan for Education,” said Karen Salmon, the state superintendent of schools. “I am convinced this is the appropriate decision in order to continue to protect the health and safety of our students, educators, staff and all members of school communities throughout Maryland," Salmon said at a news conference Wednesday. Public school students were last in their classrooms on March 13, as officials have kept kids out of their buildings in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus. An initial two-week closure was extended through mid-May then extended again on Wednesday to cover the rest of the year. All of Maryland’s neighboring states and Washington, D.C. already cancelled in-person instruction for the rest of the year. Only two other states haven’t canceled classes for the rest of the year. Wyoming schools are currently closed through May 15, and a few school districts in Montana are starting to reopen for in-person classes this week. Salmon’s announcement followed “extensive discussions” between the board of education, the Maryland Health Department and public health experts advising Hogan. The switch to online learning has been a challenge for teachers, students and parents. It has exposed a digital divide, with significant numbers of students lacking laptops or tablets and the internet access necessary to access online schoolwork. In Baltimore, for example, nearly one-quarter of homes don’t have an internet connection. Some parents have used their cellphone data plans to power their kids’ devices. By mid April — about a month into the school closures — tens of thousands of children had not logged into their online learning systems or picked up paper lesson packets, according to a survey of school superintendents. Closing for the remainder of the year “is the right decision for the safety of students, educators and families. But it is sad because educators really miss their students. We want to have some closure,” said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, the union representing the majority of teachers in the state. Bost said the inequalities that have become evident during the period since physical schools closed down have to be addressed in the future. “This is going to be a very long period of time for them to lose progress in learning,” she said. Parents and students have been anxiously awaiting some definitive ruling from the state for weeks, but Bost said she thought overall the state was right to make the decisions in a gradual manner. “It was its own transition period. It eased us into it even though it created anxiety,” Bost said. The final decision was welcomed by Baltimore City school parent Joe Kane. “It allows parents to move forward during the COVID-19. Our routine has been day by day. Now we can begin to adjust our schedules. It is adjusting to what this new reality is,” he said. His family is considering making their children work intensively for three days in a row and then give them two days off. Children still have a lot of concerns about their futures, he said, particularly if they are moving from elementary to middle school or if they are juniors in high school. “They are still looking for guidance as to how this will play out. For them, it is more getting some understanding of what their future holds,” Kane said. Salmon emphasized that the school recovery plan does not make any mandates that school systems must follow. Rather, the plan outlines a set of options for school systems to consider. When schools finally do resume in-person classes, they could opt to reopen on a staggered schedule, to small groups or on a case-by-case basis depending on a student’s needs. A full return of the study body to in-person instruction would likely come during the final stage of the governor’s three-phase plan for relaxing restrictions put in place due to the coronavirus, Salmon said. The school board plan identifies several sample schedules and calendar ideas that dovetail with Gov. Larry Hogan’s recovery plan for the state. Officials said they did not expect the re-opening of schools to be included in the first stage of that plan. Even as students will remain out of their classrooms as a protective measure, Hogan announced the easing of restrictions beginning Thursday at 7 a.m. on a few outdoor activities. The governor amended his stay-at-home order to allow for individual and small group sports such as golfing and tennis, outdoor fitness instruction, recreational fishing and hunting, recreational boating and horseback riding. Maryland’s beaches and state parks will also open Thursday for walking and exercise. Local governments will have the flexibility to take similar actions at their discretion, Hogan said. Hogan also said hospitals and licensed healthcare professionals can resume elective and non-emergency procedures. Providers should exercise judgment in determining what procedures are appropriate to perform, Hogan said. The Republican governor’s stay-at-home order remains in effect, requiring most nonessential businesses to remain closed and limiting residents’ travel to only trips to procure food or supplies or to get outdoor exercise. Residents are required to wear masks in stores, on buses and trains or whenever social distancing is difficult to maintain. Hogan previously laid out a “roadmap to recovery” for gradually easing restrictions once the state experiences a flattening or decline in key coronavirus trends, such as hospitalizations and use of intensive care units. Hogan said he may soon be ready to lift the stay-at-home order across the state as the rate of hospitalizations and the number of patients in intensive care have steadily decreased. The governor said he needed “several more days of good metrics” to launch the first stage of his three-stage recovery plan for the state. “I realize that these are only small steps and that they may be of little comfort to those who are out of work and who are struggling financially,” Hogan said. “But it is thanks to all of you and your incredible sacrifices that we are making great progress.” As of Wednesday morning, there have been 28,163 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, as well as 1,338 confirmed deaths and 99 deaths attributed to the virus but lacking a confirmed lab test. Hogan also announced on Wednesday that the state will begin universal testing at poultry plants on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, where the coronavirus has spread rapidly. The state reported 1,707 coronavirus patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday morning, compared to 1,693 on Tuesday. Of those, 584 are in intensive care, up from 573 on Tuesday. More than half of the state’s fatalities are among residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to state data. Baltimore Sun reporter Nathan Ruiz contributed to this article.

Amy Brooks and Jessica Mahajan created an online village to combat coronavirus isolation in Oakland Mills
.W
Amy Brooks stared at the same void as everyone else on the afternoon of March 13. As schools shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic, Brooks wondered how she would occupy her three boys, cooped up in their Columbia home for an indefinite period. As an English teacher at Oakland Mills High School, she wondered when she might see her students again. “I was really feeling a sense of community being put on hold,” she said. “And I was really feeling bad about that.” But the next morning, as she taught a regularly scheduled online writing course for adults, a thought hit her: “Community doesn’t have to end just because you’re not in person.” Brooks already had a succession of interesting people lined up for a speaker series that was to have been held at Oakland Mills High. Why couldn’t they host the talks over Zoom? She consulted her friend and neighbor, Jessica Mahajan, who had recently designed a web site for Brooks’ writing business. Three days after schools closed, Oakland Mills Online was born. Over the ensuing three weeks, a Facebook group for the virtual learning community mushroomed from five members to more than 600. They can begin each day with an 8 a.m. journaling session and a 9 a.m. workout featuring yoga, meditation and cardio. The day ends with a 5 p.m. book club. The sessions in between might range from an all-ages lesson on American Sign Language to a presentation by Iraqi-American activist and restaurateur Andy Shallal to puffy painting with preschoolers (adult supervision required because a microwave was involved). The busiest have drawn as many as 50 households. “I think having that structure laid out for people has been important,” Mahajan said. "Honestly, it’s been important for us too, because it gives a structure to our day.” Ian Kennedy, executive director of the Downtown Columbia Arts and Culture Commission, is among those impressed by the effort to help people make the most of staying at home. “We’re all kind of fumbling through this … but this Oakland Mills Online, it’s a place where kids and adults are coming together around interesting topics and having great conversations," Kennedy said. Brooks, 42, and Mahajan, 40, sensed the effort was catching on because speakers from the Oakland Mills community lined up to participate. They believe their village was the perfect setting, given that so many kids walk to school together and so many families have lived in the same homes for multiple generations. “You’ve got a lot of connections in this community that maybe don’t exist everywhere,” Mahajan said. With the Howard County Public School System’s online curriculum ramping up, Brooks (who previously taught at Mervo and Frederick Douglass high schools in Baltimore) has resumed her day job. But she and Mahajan expect Oakland Mills Online to roll ahead, long past the pandemic. “My general life philosophy is to overcommit,” Brooks said with a laugh. Know a hero? We want to hear about the essential workers and everyday people who are keeping the Baltimore area safe, fed and cared for. Submit your heroes at baltimoresun.com/heroes.

No residents diagnosed with coronavirus, Rockville retirement home says, after patient attended event there
.W
Officials at a Rockville retirement community that was visited by a Marylander who tested positive for the new coronavirus say none of its residents have been diagnosed with the illness and none are exhibiting symptoms. The Village at Rockville also reported in a statement Saturday that Maryland Department of Health officials have told them the risk of potential exposure associated with that individual’s visit on Friday, Feb. 28, between noon and 6 p.m. remains low. “However, taking the best practice in precaution, The Village at Rockville is working closely with the MDH to follow their recommended procedures for monitoring conditions of residents and team members who attended the event through March 14, 2020,” the statement read. “Our primary focus is to maintain our highest level of well-being for our residents and team members,” said Kyle Hrebren, executive director at the facility, which is part of the National Lutheran Communities and Services, a Rockville-based nonprofit ministry of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. “We will remain diligent in taking the necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of our community and the greater Rockville community.” Out of what the statement called “an abundance of caution,” The Village at Rockville has postponed all gatherings and public events until March 14. Additionally, visiting hours will be restricted. The daughter of one resident said she was skeptical that those efforts are enough. Peggy Weldon of Rockville said she visits an 89-year-old relative at the facility every day when she can. The relative, a Korean War veteran with chronic illnesses, has been telling Weldon not to overreact, but she said she has been “alarmed” to note that management has failed to provide nurses, attendants or residents with masks and that the cleaning schedule in the building has not changed. She added that the facility has not contacted residents’ families about the situation, and that the screening management is providing consists merely of asking visitors whether they’ve traveled to an affected country such as Korea and taking their temperature. “They’re still asking you to sign in with the same old dirty pens,” said Weldon, who was highly complimentary of staff if not management. Allison Combs, a spokeswoman for National Lutheran Communities, said the company has been consulting closely with both the Maryland Department of Health and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services since before the revelations about the visitor, and both have recommended that its communities in Maryland and Virginia stick with current protocols until and unless someone shows symptoms. Weldon was visiting her relative with her 12-year-old daughter Friday when Gov. Larry Hogan held a news conference about the three Montgomery County residents who have tested positive for the virus. When Hogan appeared on a facility TV and mentioned The Village at Rockville, it was the first Weldon had heard of the connection. “I was shocked,” she said. “I went straight out into the halls and talked to the nurses. They hadn’t heard anything about it either. I said, ‘you need to have gloves and masks on.’” Weldon said she was not present the day the woman who later tested positive for coronavirus came to The Village at Rockville to “sit shiva” — take part in a traditional Jewish mourning ceremony — for a resident who had recently died. The visitor did not know she had contracted the virus. When Weldon found out what had happened, she says, she donned gloves and cleaned her relative’s room “from top to bottom," wiping down “the doorknobs, the buzzers, the bedrails, his wheelchair” with a disinfectant. She has repeated the routine several times daily. She said Hrebren has told her the facility’s usual pattern of cleaning once a day is enough and that management still has not provided staff with gloves or masks. Combs said they stood ready to do so if health authorities advised it. In the meantime, she added, residents are given twice-daily health screenings, and every visitor is screened in accord with current state health department guidelines. Guests are asked whether they have traveled to any of the four countries with the highest reported rates of coronavirus — China, South Korea, Italy and Iran — or anywhere else outside the United States and whether they’ve experienced symptoms associated with COVID-19 such as coughing or difficulty breathing. If any answer yes, Combs said, they are directed to consult their health-care providers. The three people who tested positive this week for the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease were on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River, as Hogan reported during his Friday evening news conference about the residents, the first confirmed cases in Maryland. The three — a couple in their 70s and an unrelated woman in her 50s — are currently isolated in their homes and their symptoms are abating, officials say. Five of their family members have been advised to be tested and officials continue to trace their contacts with others to determine if more people should also be tested, Fran Phillips, deputy state health secretary for public health, said during the news conference. Health officials say 70 to 100 residents, visitors and staff at the event might be at risk for contracting the coronavirus. They are urging them to monitor for symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing, until March 13. They have also been told to take their temperature twice a day and notify their health care provider if it’s greater than 100.4 degrees or if they have other symptoms. Hogan announced the three positive tests Thursday evening and then declared a state of emergency, allowing Maryland to mobilize its emergency operations center and ramp up its coordination with local and federal agencies. The respiratory disease has sickened more than 100,000 across the globe and killed more than 3,300. As of Saturday, a total of 44 Marylanders have been tested, with 41 negative. The state stopped listing the number of pending tests online Saturday. Eight of the 44 were pending as of Friday evening. As the Rockville event also included guests from the greater community, the MDH has requested that those guests contact their health care provider or the Maryland Emergency Agency Call Center at 410-517-3720. These individuals will also continue to be monitored for symptoms through March 14. But Hrebren said they won’t necessarily need to isolate themselves. “The MDH has confirmed that those who attended the event do not need to be self-quarantined unless symptoms of a fever, cough or a respiratory illness occur,” Hrebren said. “Additionally, the MDH has also confirmed that those who did not attend the event do not need to self-monitor.” According to the statement, Karen Sroka, director of clinical services for the ministry, The Village at Rockville had been educating residents and staff members about coronavirus weekly and following recommendations from both the Centers for Disease Control and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services before the reported visit. Weldon, a teacher, remains doubtful the efforts are enough. But she says her relative, a man who generally keeps to himself, continues to preach calm and has even joked about the situation. “You know what he told me? ‘Now you know why I never go to Bingo.’ He deserves better, but he’s a trooper,” she said.

54 new cases of coronavirus in Maryland, raising state’s total to at least 244 Sunday
.W
Another 54 cases of coronavirus were reported in Maryland on Sunday, bringing the state’s total to at least 244. Three people have died. Baltimore City cases jumped from 15 to 24 from Saturday to Sunday. Increases elsewhere include 18 cases in Anne Arundel, up from 15; Baltimore County has 28 cases, up from 19; Charles County went from 4 to 5; Howard County has 24, up from 19; Montgomery County went from 68 to 83; Prince George’s County now has 40, up from 36. Other places reported case totals of five in Harford County, four in Carroll County and two each in Calvert, Wicomico and Worcester counties. One case has been reported in each of the following counties: Caroline, Cecil, Frederick, St. Mary’s, Somerset, Talbot, Washington and Queen Anne’s. That brings confirmed cases to at least 20 of Maryland’s 24 jurisdictions. The official counts come from the governor’s office, although counties are tracking cases individually, so there may be slight discrepancies in the numbers. Also Sunday, the University of Maryland announced a fourth confirmed case of COVID-19 affiliated with the the school. The person is a staff member in the College of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences, the university said. Over the past two weeks, the individual was only known to be on campus March 12 and the university said its notified any individuals that may have had direct contact. Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday, in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press," the state is continuing to monitor risk potential and implement measures to limit people’s ability to congregate in groups larger than 10 people. The Republican governor said, for instance, a group of people who went to Florida for spring break were told to self-quarantine for 14 days upon returning to Maryland. Hogan said he continues to be concerned about people heeding warnings not to gather in groups. He pointed to pictures of people congregating in parks in Virginia and Washington to look at blooming cherry blossoms. Worldwide, more than 300,000 cases have been reported, including 13,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University. The total number of cases across the region has reached about 500, including 98 in Washington and 156 in Virginia. In Maryland, most of the cases involve people ages 18 to 64, according to state officials. On Sunday, 200 cases were in that range ages. Forty-one cases involved people age 65 and older. Three cases were reported for people 18 and younger. The latest death, reported late Saturday, was a Montgomery County woman in her 40s. She reportedly had underlying health conditions. Previously, the state reported two men, both in their 60s with underlying health conditions, had succumbed to the virus. The state’s first death was reported Wednesday in Prince George’s County and the second in Baltimore County on Friday. The virus is most deadly for seniors and people with compromised immune systems. On the Sunday talk show, Hogan was asked about whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies should be in charge of purchasing and distributing medical resources, such as face masks. President Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Protection Act to invoke private companies to focus on producing critical items, but it is unclear as to how long it will take for resources to reach healthcare workers. Hogan said that while the state has been working with the federal government and other governors, he said, “FEMA has to take the lead." More resources, he said, are overdue. Hogan, along with other governors, has been pushing the federal government to take a more prominent lead in securing medical supplies. “It’s not nearly enough," Hogan said. "It’s not fast enough. We’re way behind the curve.” Maryland, meanwhile, is continuing to purchase resources as they are available on the open market, the governor said, adding, “It’s not a perfect situation." New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who appeared on “Meet the Press” alongside the Maryland governor, took issue with Hogan’s characterization of a cooperative federal government. At one point, de Blasio interrupted host Chuck Todd to say, “Our military is being sidelined and the White House is in denial.” Hogan said the federal government has been aiding the state. “We got military all over our state doing great things," Hogan said, "helping with hospitals and building new hospital beds. “Your governor of New York is doing the same thing, so maybe you ought to try to talk with him." Shot back de Blasio, “Not everyone is doing everything that they could think of. Let’s be honest about it.” Like other New York and other states, Hogan has declared a state of emergency in Maryland, triggering response by the National Guard. Among the more than 2,000 Guard members on duty in Maryland, some have been seen in Baltimore and elsewhere. They are helping to distribute meals supporting hospitals, in addition to a variety of statewide tasks. Whether all of the closures, social distancing measures and other precautions are having an impact in Maryland is still unclear. “The short answer is, it is too early to tell. And, if they are, it will be difficult to know,” said Dr. Jason Farley, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Nursing and Medicine and an infectious disease-trained nurse epidemiologist. The key to understanding the scope of the virus in Maryland — and elsewhere — lies in the ability to test the public. Testing is only now beginning to become somewhat more widely available, and some hospitals have opened screening clinics. “The true extent of the outbreak is still not well known,” Farley said. Farley said if someone in Maryland is experiencing a slight elevation in temperature and a slight cough, but otherwise feels OK, they should self-quarantine at home. They can also reach out to their primary care provider for a session over the phone or online to get specific advice. According to the state Department of Health, Maryland is working to increase testing availability. Testing will be expanded as soon as the state has more supplies, including through the use of more drive-through testing sites. “Testing is appropriate for those who are at the highest risk for developing the severe COVID-19 disease,” the health department said in a statement Sunday. “Not everyone needs a test, but everyone can adapt recommended practices such as good hand-washing and social distancing to reduce their risk of exposure.” Farley said the test being used to diagnosis the new coronavirus can diagnosis multiple other viruses at the same time, including two types of influenzia and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The test involves a swab that is inserted about three inches into the back of a person’s nose, to the place where the nose reaches the very top of the throat.

Maryland National Guard to conduct flyovers Friday in honor of coronavirus responders, essential workers
.W
The Maryland National Guard will conduct flyovers Friday afternoon to pay tribute to first responders and essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic. The flyover is scheduled to begin approximately 1:45 p.m. and end 3:30 p.m. A formation of four A-10C Thunderbolt II aircraft will start in Bel Air before making its way through Frederick, Waldorf, Salisbury, Easton, Annapolis, Towson, Columbia and Baltimore. Residents are asked to observe the flyover from their home and avoid large gatherings. “Our Soldiers and Airmen are proud to serve alongside those on the frontlines keeping everyone safe during these challenging times,” Maj. Gen. Timothy Gowen, adjutant general of Maryland, wrote in a news release. “This day is a small way to show our appreciation to everyone that is doing their part to combat the coronavirus. And to everyone who has been impacted by this pandemic, please know we are in this together and we stand with you.” Last week, the Navy’s Blue Angels and Air Force’s Thunderbirds flew over Baltimore and the Washington, D.C., area to honor first responders and health care workers.

As Baltimore records third coronavirus death, police say they’re ready to enforce ‘stay-at-home’ order
.W
A third Baltimore resident has died from the new coronavirus, officials announced Tuesday, as police work to enforce a statewide “stay-at-home” order. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said the latest death, a woman in her 70s, is a “tragic reminder” of the dangers associated with the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus. He urged residents to stay home and take the pandemic seriously. “This is our chance to save lives in our city,” Young said. The news came less than 24 hours after Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s latest executive order went into effect, requiring residents to stay at home except for essential activities. Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the department is prepared to enforce the order, although police have not been instructed to arbitrarily stop people on the street to do so. “We want to encourage voluntary compliance,” he said. “When we find that people are not voluntarily complying, then the instructions will be to make a physical arrest. We are working very hard in a proactive way to get voluntary compliance." Harrison said the department will investigate complaints about residents flouting the mandate. Across the state, law enforcement officials have responded to more than 400 calls for individuals violating the order. Violators can face a $5,000 fine and a year in jail. The commissioner also said that roughly 40 officers are self-quarantining for various reasons, including some who travelled internationally and others who may have been exposed to someone exhibiting symptoms. Only one officer has so far tested positive for COVID-19, Harrison said. Two members of the Fire Department also contracted the illness. Fire Chief Niles Ford said Tuesday that nearly 20 department recruits are self-quarantining because one of their peers showed symptoms. There are 187 confirmed cases in Baltimore City, and 1,660 across the state.

David Michael Dudley, Windsor Mill resident and bus driver, dies of coronavirus at 61
.W
More than 170 people have died in Maryland of the coronavirus since the pandemic began. One of them was David Michael Dudley Sr., a 61-year-old Windsor Mill resident who died March 31. His son said he was previously healthy aside from needing medication for high blood pressure. Mr. Dudley loved few things more than driving, preaching and singing — particularly gospel music and songs by the Jackson 5. For years, his nickname was “Dudley Do Right." A longtime bus driver, he most recently worked for Coach USA.. The company has begun suspending or reducing services in parts of the United States, though no schedule changes for Maryland were listed on its website. His sudden death has hit his family hard. Unable to give him a kiss and a hug in person, they said their final goodbyes through video conference. Born Feb. 7, 1959, to Lawrence David and Margaret Lassiter Dudley, Mr. Dudley was the oldest of four in a close-knit family that lived in Edmondson Village. As a teen, he became a wrestling star at Edmondson High School, holding a record of 40-2 throughout his high school career. In addition to wrestling, Mr. Dudley loved music — the Temptations and the Jackson 5 — and sang with various gospel choirs through his 20s. His favorite hymn: “I Won’t Complain.” “My father could really sing,” said his eldest son, David Michael “Mike” Dudley Jr. “I guess when he was younger he used to visit his grandmother in North Carolina. He would imitate the Jacksons. He did it so well they thought he was a member of the Jackson 5.” Music brought him to his future wife, Vernessia Wilson, whose brother sang in a gospel group with him. In addition to his singing voice, “he had a beautiful personality,” she said. He had a reputation for being a straight arrow, generous and willing to help others. They married on June 27, 1981, and had two sons, Mike and Marcus. After graduating from Edmondson High School in 1978, Mr. Dudley worked toward a certificate from Christian Radio Broadcasting and spent several years working for area gospel radio stations. He later became a milkman for the Cloverland Milk Co. and then a bus driver, eventually working for Coach USA. He loved to drive, his son said. “Other than preaching and singing, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him happier. He genuinely loved driving.” When not working, Mr. Dudley for some years drove a cherry-red Mustang convertible trimmed in black. On a hot summer day years ago, he took his two sons to buy milkshakes. He blasted a gospel rap CD from a friend on the sound system. Michael, then a teenager, was mortified. A devout churchgoer and preacher, Mr. Dudley belonged to the Community Church of Christ in East Baltimore and St. Matthew’s Gospel Tabernacle in West Baltimore. From 1986 to 1995, he was pastor at the second campus of the Community Church of Christ in West Baltimore. He always wore a suit and a hat to attend services. To family gatherings, he would tuck his shirt into his jeans, his son recalled with a laugh. Mr. Dudley had a knack for always finding the right words at the most difficult time. When Michael’s grandmother, his dad’s mom, died, he was devastated. Though grieving also, his father managed to deliver the eulogy. “I could barely lift my head up, and here he is eulogizing.” His son has yearned for that strength in recent days. Mr. Dudley’s last day of work was Monday, March 23. He woke up the following day coughing. His wife urged him to stay home. The cough worsened. Three days later, he was in an ambulance on his way to Northwest Hospital, where he was placed in a medically induced coma. When his family called later to check on his condition, they learned he was on life support. He was transferred to the University of Maryland Medical Center, where his condition deteriorated further. A test for the coronavirus came back positive. The hospital workers set up a call on Zoom, the video conferencing service, so his family could say “I love you” one last time. “I can accept the fact that he was dying. I can accept that,” said his son. “But it was the fact that he lived his life the way that he did, treated people the way that he did, and to go out like this. ... It’s probably the most unfair thing I’ve ever seen.” In addition to his wife and sons, Mr. Dudley is survived by his youngest brother, Ronald, of Baltimore and one granddaughter. A brother, Charles, and sister, Jackie, preceded him in death.

‘We’re not playing around’: Maryland law enforcement prepared to arrest people who defy coronavirus shutdown
.W
Hours after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced sweeping executive orders Monday to restrict public gatherings and business operations due to the new coronavirus, state police and local law enforcement agencies said they were prepared to arrest those who deliberately flout the directives. Hogan issued an executive order Monday to shut down all bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms in Maryland, effective at 5 p.m., to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants may continue delivery, carryout and drive-thru services. Hogan also ordered members of the public on Monday to follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention limiting gatherings to 50 people applies to social, community, religious and recreational or sports activities. On Thursday, the governor further limited gatherings to 10 people. Hogan said the tighter restriction follows guidance from the federal government to limit gatherings to 10. In a statement, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Woodrow W. Jones III said the department will work to enforce those orders “around the clock and across the state.” Jones is hoping Maryland businesses and residents will voluntarily comply without the need for further encouragement — but said his department is prepared to arrest business owners, customers and citizens who ignore the governor’s instructions. Violation of a governor’s executive order declared during a state of emergency is punishable with a fine of up to $5,000 or one year in jail or both, Jones said in a statement. “If a need for law enforcement action arises, we will take the appropriate action,” he said. “We are first conferencing with state’s attorneys and local law enforcement chiefs and sheriffs across Maryland. We will work in support of and partnership with those local authorities.” If a complaint is lodged against a business, deputies plan to first make contact with the owner or manager of the establishment. If voluntary compliance does not occur, state police will cooperate with the local state’s attorney to potentially issue a criminal summons or warrant, Jones said. Spokesman Maj. Kurt Rauschenberg said the Maryland National Guard will support and coordinate with state and local police as directed or requested. In Baltimore, the police and health departments will work together to enforce the executive orders, said Lester Davis, a spokesman for Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young. “We’re not playing around,” Davis said. “The hope is that people understand the seriousness of this and will comply and we won’t have to use enforcement measures. But we’re more than willing to do that.” In a statement, Young said he needed city residents to “adjust to this new reality.” “Our residents are now, literally, our public health officers and we need them all to protect each other by following best practices around social distancing to limit the spread of this virus," Young said. "The best thing Baltimoreans can do today is to stay home and not expose themselves or their families to any unnecessary risk. Not all superheroes wear capes, some stay at home.” Baltimore Police, in conjunction with the Baltimore Health Department, the Baltimore Fire Department and Board of Liquor License Commissioners, will begin inspections and enforcement across the city Monday night. City police Commissioner Michael Harrison encouraged residents to call 311 — not 911 — with any nonemergency related calls related to businesses or gatherings of crowds. “We remain focused on keeping residents safe and will continue to work closely with our local partners to serve the residents to decrease the spread of COVID-19,” Harrison said in a statement. In Baltimore County, law enforcement officials have joined the department of health, the fire marshal, code enforcement and the liquor board in forming a government task force to enforce the orders. Officers, who are being instructed to record gatherings via their body-worn cameras, will be empowered to break up large gatherings of more than 10 people at all venues in the county, and officials also have the authority to further reduce the number. The enforcement of the order prohibiting gatherings or events of 10 or more people at all locations and venues will be “primarily complaint-driven,” said Sean Naron, a spokesman for Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr.'s administration. Naron said people should call 911 if they see violations of the executive order. Those calls will be routed to the health department, whose staff will take the lead on enforcement with assistance from police, if necessary, Naron said. The health department will dispatch an inspector who can issue a citation based on the governor’s directive, he said. Several other county law enforcement agencies confirmed their officers also plan to educate noncompliant citizens and businesses, but are prepared to take further legal action if necessary. In Anne Arundel County, police said reports of violations will be handled on a case-by-case basis with officers seeking voluntary compliance before taking an enforcement action, department spokesman Marc Limansky said. Anyone observing a gathering that appears to be in violation of the order is asked to call Anne Arundel police’s nonemergency number 410-222-8610, Limansky said. Harford County Sheriff’s deputies who notice a noncompliant establishment while on proactive patrol or receive a call alleging executive order violations will respond as they would in any other call for service, said department spokeswoman Cristie Hopkins. Hopkins said citizens can call 911, the nonemergency number 410-838-6600 or the precincts directly with concerns. Spokesman Cpl. Jonathan Light with the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office said deputies plan to educate any noncompliant group of the statewide orders. If those efforts are not successful in disbanding large groups, Light said deputies will consult with the county State’s Attorney’s Office and take whatever action is deemed appropriate. Baltimore Sun reporters Talia Richman and Wilborn P Nobles III and Baltimore Sun Media reporter Cody Boteler contributed to this article.

Concerns raised about coronavirus response after 2 staffers test positive at Baltimore homeless shelter
.W
Staff at Baltimore’s Project PLASE homeless shelter learned in an email Wednesday that two of their co-workers had tested positive for the new coronavirus. Yet residents — several of them medically vulnerable — had not been notified as of Monday afternoon, according to a resident and a staffer. In addition, social distancing and hygiene protocols have not been enforced, they said. Mary C. Slicher, the founder and executive director of Project PLASE, said Sunday that she believed a manager informed residents Thursday and that the facility has been proactive in implementing hygiene protocols before and after its staff members tested positive for COVID-19. However, on Monday she said she had learned that managers had not wished to violate the privacy of the infected staffers and instead staff discussed safe practices with the shelter’s approximately 40 residents. In recent weeks, homeless shelters — much like nursing homes — have emerged as potential hot spots for the novel coronavirus. In San Francisco, 70 people were infected at a single shelter. In New York City, 23 residents of homeless shelters have died of the disease, according to The New York Times. In Baltimore, shelter managers and advocates say social distancing is difficult to enforce, and protective equipment is hard to come by. But the lack of communication at Project PLASE appears to run counter to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was particularly troubling to members of the Project PLASE community. “It’s almost as if we don’t exist, we don’t mean nothing, and they can just do what they want to do and not tell us anything," said William Miller, 65, who has lived at Project PLASE’s Maryland Avenue shelter for the past nine months. Slicher emailed staff members Wednesday to inform them that two workers at the shelter had tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, and “hence have been in contact with the PLASE shelter facilities.” The email said she then asked staffers to contact their doctors if they interacted with either infected staffer in the two days before they exhibited symptoms. But Miller said no notice has been given to the residents about the infected staff members. He said he was close with one of them and recently began coughing “constantly” and experiencing chest pain. Miller said he underwent a drive-thru COVID-19 test Saturday afternoon. Miller said several residents, including himself, are HIV-positive or have otherwise compromised immune systems, putting them at greater risk of the virus. A senior-level employee who was not authorized to speak on the record confirmed Miller’s account that residents have not been informed that staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Slicher said the two staff members who tested positive for COVID-19 have been away from the facility since the last week of March and that no staff members or residents have exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 in the weeks that followed. The incubation period for COVID lasts from two to 14 days, according to the CDC. Slicher’s email said the Baltimore City Health Department would conduct contact tracing for the two infected staff members. Slicher said Sunday that she had met with health department officials and that two came to the facility Friday to review proper hygiene protocol. On Monday, she said the representatives had not recommended obtaining personal protective equipment. Slicher added Monday that she attempted to obtain health supplies, such as disinfectant wipes and rubbing alcohol, through the Baltimore City Health Department but was referred to forms to request them. Slicher also said the facility submitted a supply request to the Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services but had yet to receive them. The shelter in recent weeks has purchased materials such as hand soap, water, and bleach, and the staff has conducted “intensive cleaning” since early March, Slicher said. In response to multiple interview requests from The Baltimore Sun, Adam Abadir, a spokesman for the city health department, emailed a statement Monday, saying the agency “has been working with the Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services to provide guidance and recommendations to shelter managers for preventing transmission of COVID-19. Additionally, [the health department] has been conducting in-person visits ... to provide guidance to facility managers.” Project PLASE (People Lacking Ample Shelter and Employment) addresses homelessness in Baltimore by providing temporary housing, permanent housing and supportive services to homeless adults and families. It recorded $7.4 million in revenue for 2017, the most recent year for which tax filings were listed online. Project PLASE, which helped more than 1,500 people between the summers of 2018 and 2019, is poised to expand, with a $24 million redevelopment of Whiteford Hall in southwest Baltimore’s Irvington neighborhood. The CDC’s guidance for homeless shelters amid the pandemic includes informing those who might have been exposed and using multiple strategies to ensure proper social distancing. A CDC spokesperson could not be reached for comment. “Never have they told the clients, had a conversation with the clients, and said, ‘We got staff members that have been [tested] positive for the coronavirus, so we would advise you to go to your doctor or try to get a test,’ ” Miller said. “They’re putting people’s lives in jeopardy without any thought at all." Slicher’s Wednesday email said shelter staff and residents have been screened with a temperature check once a day for the 10 days prior. Slicher wrote that she was working to get touch-free infrared thermometers. She also recommended disinfecting areas that hands regularly touch at least four times a day. Miller, who helped start the Bmore POWER organization, which passes out the opioid overdose prevention drug naloxone in areas of Baltimore hit hard by drug overdoses, said as far as he knows, Slicher’s cleaning and disinfecting recommendations haven’t been enforced. The senior-level employee corroborated Miller’s account regarding a lack of enforcement of hygiene protocols. Miller said he’s seen only “some” staff members wear masks but that the practice has not been made mandatory. Miller also said residents haven’t been given masks and he recently went outside the facility to get two masks for residents. Slicher said Monday that 120 masks were given to staff two to three weeks ago and handed out to residents last week. She added that another batch of 150 masks was delivered Monday and the masks were in the process of being dispersed to residents and staff. Slicher acknowledged that “there’s some challenges in a communal setting” with social distancing, but the facility is “doing the best we can,” including limiting the number of people in the dining area to eight to 10 people at a time. Jeff Singer, former longtime president and CEO of Health Care for the Homeless, said Monday that practicing social distancing in a congregate setting is “pretty near impossible.” “Even if the staff did the best job they could, it couldn’t work because of the physical setup,” Singer said. The Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services has worked in recent weeks to ease the packed setting in homeless shelters. In an email Monday to The Sun, spokesman James Bentley II wrote that last week the office facilitated the transfer of more than 150 residents at the three shelters operated by the city of Baltimore to motel rooms. Priority is given to residents over age 62 and those with underlying medical conditions. To date, the office has not been notified of any confirmed cases of COVID-19 among residents in shelters operated by the city. It’s unclear whether there have been any confirmed cases for residents at privately owned shelters such as Project PLASE.

Amid coronavirus fears, Maryland colleges get conflicting signals on decisions to change plans for large events
.W
As the new coronavirus spreads, difficult decisions are being made, in Maryland and around the world, to close some public gatherings and bar the public from other events. Gov. Larry Hogan on Friday drew a line between the decisions made by officials at two Maryland universities. In a Friday news conference, Hogan said he concurs with University of Maryland, College Park officials who said athletic games should be kept open to the public although people are concerned about the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “We don’t think in general there is a reason for cancelling large events unless there is a particular set of circumstances,” Hogan said Friday while giving an update on coronavirus cases in the state. “The University of Maryland made their own decision [to hold games with spectators present] which I think was the right decision.” Hogan did not have praise for the way another area university handled a similar situation. He said Johns Hopkins University made an independent decision to bar public attendance at the opening rounds of the NCAA Division III men’s basketball tournament at Goldfarb Gymnasium on the Homewood campus. “Hopkins made a decision on its own,” the governor said. The three people in Montgomery County — the first confirmed cases in Maryland — who tested positive for COVID-19 this week were on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River, Hogan said. The three — a couple in their 70s and an unrelated woman in her 50s — are currently isolated in their homes and their symptoms are abating, officials say. In contrast to the governor’s comments, University System of Maryland Chancellor Jay A. Perman said in a Friday statement that college leaders should not rule out altering plans for “large gatherings,” including sports events. “Where large gatherings can be canceled, postponed, or taken to an online environment, that is what I am asking campus leaders to consider,” Perman said in the statement. “I am not issuing a mandate, but I am advising that we be smart, and apply our best judgment to a situation that is changing hourly.” The University of Maryland is part of the University System of Maryland, but Johns Hopkins University is not. A spokesperson for University of Maryland, College Park said, “The University of Maryland continues to be in regular communication with county and state health officials on our response and preparedness for COVID-19. Sunday’s men’s basketball game will be held as scheduled, and we will continue to closely monitor this evolving situation to assess all campus activities.” Maryland men’s basketball head coach Mark Turgeon was asked March 2 about safety precautions regarding travel with his team. “We get an email all the time from the university once a day. ‘No cases, this is what we’re doing, if you feel this way this is what you can do,’ ” he said. Johns Hopkins University spokeswoman Karen Lancaster said the university did not make the decision to exclude spectators from the tournament lightly and recognizes “the disappointment it may have caused for players, families and fans.” The decision was “based on input from Johns Hopkins experts in public health, infectious diseases, and emergency management and guidance from public health officials,” Lancaster wrote in an email to the Sun. “The CDC has posted guidance regarding large gatherings, and we consulted with the Maryland Department of Health as we made a holistic assessment of the situation and all available information.” Given that every event has its own specific set of circumstances and factors, “in this case, we concluded that it was not prudent to hold a multi-day indoor event drawing several thousand visitors from multiple geographies, including at least one where there were confirmed cases of COVID-19, and in light of the evolving information about the just-confirmed cases in of Maryland,” Lancaster wrote. A student at Yeshiva University, whose team took part in the first tournament game, tested positive for the virus, a discovery that led the school to close its main campus in New York. Lancaster added that Hopkins plans to evaluate “each large-scale university event, including athletic events, on a case-by-case basis, and we expect most events to continue as scheduled.” As of Saturday, a total of 44 Marylanders have been tested, with 41 negative. The state stopped listing the number of pending tests online Saturday. The respiratory disease has sickened more than 100,000 across the globe and killed more than 3,300. Baltimore Sun reporter Daniel Oyefusi contributed to this report.

Maryland universities worry coronavirus outbreak in China could prevent foreign students from getting here 
.W
As governments and health agencies shut down travel and limit public gatherings in an attempt to contain the deadly coronavirus, Maryland colleges and universities say the response could slow — or shut off — a pipeline of Chinese students. Auditions at the Peabody Institute were more subdued this week as some Chinese applicants remained home, submitting their auditions digitally. The Johns Hopkins University scrambled to provide students on its China campus access to online courses more than a year ahead of schedule while its building remains closed. And Salisbury University is encouraging its Chinese-national seniors to apply for a student visa program that allows students to remain in Maryland and work for a year after graduation — giving more time to cope with coronavirus-related restrictions. Still, some Maryland colleges and universities fear that all the disruptions, such as prolonged air travel interruptions, cancellation of standardized test dates in China and backlogs of visa applications, increase uncertainty for foreign students and the institutions they want to attend. “There is going to be a lot of concern,” said David L. Di Maria, associate vice provost for international education at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “It could take quite a while to dig out of this and return to normal." About 370,000 students from China are expected to stream into American universities, according to data from the Institute of International Education. Most are here for four years to get an undergraduate degree or longer for a master’s degree or doctorate. Of the 20,000 foreign students in Maryland’s private and public colleges and universities, 40 percent come from China, a figure that has been growing in the past five years. It’s estimated that foreign students spend about $800 million a year in the state, according to a report by the international education institute. The institute reports that the University of Maryland has the largest population of international students in the state. China contributed more graduate and undergraduate students to the university than any other country in 2018, the most recent year for which data was available. Chinese students comprise about 8% of College Park’s total enrollment of 40,000. The university’s Robert H. Smith School of Business is exploring ways to accommodate students affected by a travel ban and is considering online courses and a winter start date if students are unable to secure visas by August, Dean Ritu Agarwal said in an email. University officials declined requests for an interview about how its other schools were preparing. Officials have advised newly admitted students facing challenges caused by the coronavirus outbreak to contact the university. While the largest number of Chinese students are at the University of Maryland’s flagship campus in College Park, Johns Hopkins, UMBC, Morgan State University and Montgomery College also have hundreds of Chinese students. Hopkins officials say they are aware of about 50 faculty, staff, students and scholars unable to return to U.S. campuses from China because of travel restrictions. The university has assembled a team to address the potential complications and evaluate contingencies, said spokeswoman Karen Lancaster, adding that it is too early to speculate about alternative plans. Di Maria said the question that looms is how long the coronavirus continues to disrupt normal life and business in China. If new cases slow and most business returns to normal, universities are not likely to see a big impact. But if it continues far into the spring and summer, he said, universities may have to get creative. The College Board and other testing agencies canceled both the February and March test dates for students in mainland China to take the SAT, GRE and other exams required to apply to U.S. colleges. Those tests are offered next in May — if they aren’t canceled — and there may be more students who need to take the exams than available seats. A backlog could develop. Students might also find that getting visas may take longer and flights may be more limited. Di Maria said UMBC has only about 100 students from China, and the university is not considering the coronavirus in deciding whether to admit students from China. Universities take large numbers of foreign students for lots of reasons, but they also offer benefits to the United States over time. Because many foreign students will go back to their countries and rise into leadership positions in government and businesses, they are more likely to feel connections to the state that will be valuable. “They develop friendships. In some ways they become bicultural. They understand the nuances of the language,” Di Maria said. They also help subsidize other students. Foreign students don’t qualify for federal or state funds. And they pay out-of-state tuition rates, which means they pay far more than most students and help keep tuition for Maryland residents down. Without their presence, “you would have a lot of empty seats in your classroom,” said Di Maria. Another area of concern for graduate schools in the state is the long-term collaborative research conducted with academics in China, according to Amy Ramirez, director of international services in the center for global engagement at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. She said there are about 20 cases of researchers, post-doctorates and faculty who wanted to go to China, or were from China and wanted to come here, but are now stuck. “We are thinking about it from a research frame,” Ramirez said. “Our ability to have foreign students has implications related to research.” The UMB campus in downtown Baltimore, which is home to medical, dental, law and social work graduate schools, has about 200 Chinese nationals. Officials at Frostburg University and Washington College say it’s too early to know whether the virus will have a long term impact on their admissions, but they will be monitoring the situation closely. “There are a lot of unknowns,” said Brian Stigler, Salisbury University’s assistant provost for international education. Stigler said the top concern is students at partner universities in China who planned to enroll at Salisbury in the fall. “If the universities in China do not open as scheduled next month, which is a possibility," he said, "those students will not have the support of their international offices to organize the paperwork and supporting documents we need to begin their fall admissions processes.” Even if the university partners resume operations, Stigler also worries about sufficient air travel for students come summer, and whether the federal government would grant student visas to Chinese students. Brad Farnsworth, vice president at the American Council on Education, a higher education research and advocacy group, said he doesn’t believe the coronavirus will be a long-term concern for Chinese students who want to come to the U.S. “These are wealthy middle-class families in China who place great stake in a student earning a degree in a foreign country,” he said. But it may make universities here look again at the dependence on China for such a large percentage of their foreign students. “People have been saying for years it is time to diversify," he said. "I think it will get the conversations jump-started. This is the wake-up call.”

Harford schools taking steps to deliver instruction to students if coronavirus closures go past March 27
.W
Harford County Public Schools are putting plans in place to push instruction to students should school closures related to the novel coronavirus pandemic extend beyond March 27, which seems more inevitability than possibility with each passing day. “I think a lot of people are expecting we’ll be out of school longer,” Superintendent Sean Bulson said Thursday. That presents a challenge to Harford and other school districts across Maryland. Several colleges had already moved to online only instruction and, on Thursday, the University System of Maryland announced shortly after Gov. Larry Hogan’s press conference on coronavirus updates that it is likely face-to-face classes are done for the year at its 12 institutions. But public schools don’t necessarily have the same infrastructure to move to remote learning as easily. “Circumstances sort of dictate the way things go and we’ve been focused on more of an in-person style of learning,” Bulson said. “So this is going to change our conversation … we hope we don’t run into this again any time soon, but the fact that we weren’t in a place to pivot where colleges — most students attending college are using a device — it’s a much easier pivot for them. “I think there’s a general expectation from people who live in a technology driven world that everyone is able to do it and the fact that we’re not, it shouldn’t be a surprise, but I think it still is in some cases.” When Bulson was hired in 2018, he did a series of Listen and Learn tours to hear from various stakeholders and one of the big takeaways, he said, was that there was concern about the overuse of technology in the classroom. “A lot of places where I had conversations with people, what they were seeing was parents were worried about screentime for kids and things like that,” he said. “I was getting a lot of feedback that they wanted more hands-on, more interactive [lessons], not to have as big a focus on screentime while in school. “And I very much saw the value in that, because when I walk into a classroom and see a few kids sitting around one computer and working together and kind of interacting, that looks like great instruction. But when you walk into a room and see 30 kids all looking at an individual screen, that doesn’t feel quite the same,” he said. So while the school system hadn’t been investing in a one-to-one ratio of devices to students, it now finds itself in a “tougher spot,” Bulson said, when students can’t be interacting in person. Surveys have gone out to both staff and to parents of students to determine who has access to the internet or a device at home. Of course, the challenge there is “doing a survey to find out who doesn’t have internet access right now, is the people who don’t have it don’t have anything to respond with,” Bulson said. Once some data is collected, however, the school system will begin working to convert some devices in schools to give to staff to make sure they have the ability to push instructional content to students. “We’ll have to do a bit of a triage when it comes to technology. After we deal with ensuring staff has something to communicate to students, if we can do that electronically, our next line is to look at students with special needs first who need something and then expanding the group to other students who don’t have access,” Bulson said. “With everything, once we have a sense of if we need to push devices out to people, we then have to bring those devices in, reconfigure them to be used on a home network and all that stuff that comes with it.” School system staff are also trying to figure out if they would be able to utilize television to deliver instructional material to students, and looking into the possibility of sharing resources with other jurisdictions, he said. In discussions with other superintendents, Bulson said there has been talk about whether the state education department can give each jurisdiction a “minimum threshold for readiness and support.” “I think we may see conversations about maybe a state-driven learning management system, maybe looking at resources so we can all be on the same page with some of things that drive this type of instruction,” he said. “In this moment, I think that would be helpful for us.” A silver lining of sorts, Bulson said, is that a lot of innovation occurs during a time of crisis. “We’re doing things now in the school district that I think are going to help us operate better in the future,” he said.

‘They need our help’: Free meals during coronavirus will cost Baltimore-area schools millions without aid
.W
It was lunchtime, and Shelise Harding and Christine David wheeled a cart to the walk-in refrigerator at John Ruhrah Elementary/Middle School and loaded it with boxed-to-go meals they’d prepared: fruit, vegetables, tuna sandwiches, crackers, bread and milk. Bypassing the school’s empty lunch line and the cafeteria tables bearing boxes of Maryland Food Bank donations, the food service workers rolled cart after cart of meals to a waiting line of students, parents and others in need at a school entrance. The East Baltimore school’s coronavirus food operation went into overdrive on a recent Thursday when people queued up for more than 1,000 meals — 100 more than the school’s students normally eat each day, said Aikaterine Patrikios, the John Ruhrah cafeteria manager affectionately known as “Ms. Kathy." “We welcome them," she said in an interview. “We know they need our help. We are here for them. That is the whole story: ‘You’re not by yourself out there. We are here.' ” Despite feeding whole families and neighborhoods instead of just their students — and busy days, especially when the food bank donations are distributed — schools actually have served fewer meals per day, not more, since closing in March due to the coronavirus, officials say. The federal government has relaxed some regulations to allow meals to be served outside of group settings and picked up by parents. But because the U.S. Department of Agriculture reimburses schools for meals on a per-student basis, schools in Maryland and around the country are bracing for tens of millions of dollars in losses from their food programs, unless they receive additional funding. Food service workers feeding their communities are “incredible heroes people aren’t paying attention to,” said Katie Wilson, executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance. The alliance, which represents large urban school districts including New York, Los Angeles, Baltimore and Chicago, is asking for federal aid and is soliciting donations to assist its members with transportation, overtime, protective equipment and other costs. “In the meantime, [schools are] having a major fallout from this," Wilson said. "I don’t think America understands the critical role they have always played in their communities, and now it’s really coming to light.” Some schools are allowing adults to buy meals for themselves or providing them with meals through alternate funding sources. The USDA itself “does not have the authority to reimburse these meals,” a department spokeswoman said. Instead, hungry adults are encouraged to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Low-income families in Maryland will receive $5.70 per child per day in additional funding to offset the cost of meals their children would otherwise be served for free or at a discounted price at school, after the state was approved this week to participate in the federal Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program. “For schools that are closed, we are doing our very best to make sure kids are fed," Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. "Local school nutrition professionals know how best to feed their children, and we are working with them and their partners to give greater flexibilities and waive restrictions.” Without additional funding, Baltimore City Public Schools alone expects to lose an estimated $15 million to $20 million from its food service operations during the coronavirus closure, said Liz Marchetta, the school district’s executive director of food and nutrition services. Baltimore City schools have served 228,505 meals and counting at 18 sites since the closure, with children’s meals accounting for more than 60% of them, Marchetta said. Celebrity chef Jose Andres’ World Central Kitchen has served nearly 20,000 meals at an additional 10 sites, she said. On a regular school day, by comparison, the district serves about 90,000 meals, she said. Without financial aid, the costs of operating free meal sites at city schools will fall to the city or the schools, forcing them to decide whether to continue them — and, if so, how, Marchetta said. "This would essentially pit funding for meal programs against other important school district priorities,” she said. “Some districts and counties are better positioned to assume these costs than others.” Baltimore County Public Schools had served nearly 550,600 total meals from Mondays to Thursdays at 60 food sites as of April 24, spokesman Brandon Oland said. (Separate Friday food drives have launched at Parkville and Owings Mills high schools.) The county school system is using its food inventory “as best we can” and has opened up two new food sites, including one at Hereford High School, Oland said. Meals are free to all minors, he said. “Our role as a school system is to feed students," he said. "The need is great right now, and we are striving to continue providing meals to students through this extended closure.” Howard County Public Schools has served more than 450,000 total meals, said Brian W. Bassett, a county schools spokesman. “Our food sites are aligned with the federal guidelines, and we are still working through the the federal reimbursement process,” Bassett said. Harford County Public Schools had provided more than 258,600 meals as of Monday and anticipate giving out 156,000 more by May 15, said spokeswoman Jillian Lader. The meals come in packs that include a breakfast, lunch and dinner. “We are still working on total projected cost at this time,” Lader said. Carroll County Public Schools have provided an estimated 530,000 meals since schools closed, spokeswoman Carey Gaddis said. The Carroll school system is reimbursed from the federal Child Nutrition Programs for all breakfast and lunches and some suppers it serves, she said. She did not provide a cost estimate. Federal relief is being sought “for any of the suppers served that are not reimbursed,” Gaddis said. An Anne Arundel County Public Schools spokesman did not respond to questions for this article. Students going hungry during the coronavirus pandemic was the top concern of school meal program directors around the country, according to a March survey by the nonprofit School Nutrition Association. Other worries included financial impact to school meal programs, concerns about cafeteria staffers and logistical challenges, including transportation. But another, intertwined challenge looms large: the end of the school year, when school systems transition to separate summer meals programs. City schools officials — and those in neighboring jurisdictions and across the country — are still working on their plans for food service during the summer months. And they’re monitoring any and all announcements by state and federal officials for news on any adjustments to ensure hungry students and communities have the food they need during the summer. Nikira Stinson drove from Belair Road in Northeast Baltimore to pick up tuna sandwiches, fruits, vegetables and snacks for her sons, Ayden, 4, and Jeremy, 17, and her stepdaughter, Tarie, 9. Only Ayden, a pre-kindergartner, is a student at John Ruhrah Elementary/Middle, his mother said. “It’s convenient to pick up everyone’s lunch at one location,” she said. Another mother, Mariana Molina, hasn’t worked in a month and a half due to the coronavirus, she said. Molina picked up three meals at John Ruhrah, for herself and her two kids on a recent day. “I feel good,” she said.

Baltimore County will open first drive-thru coronavirus testing site at state fairgrounds Thursday
.W
Baltimore County’s first drive-thru coronavirus testing clinic will open Thursday at the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium, the county announced. The clinic will test people who have a medical order from a health care provider, the county said in a news release. Once authorization is obtained, people must schedule an appointment using the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients, known as CRISP, which is the State-Designated Health Information Exchange. People who arrive at the site without an order from a health care provider or without an appointment will not be tested, the county said. Testing is planned for Tuesdays and Thursdays while test kits are available. The fairgrounds can accommodate multiple lanes of vehicles at once, according to the county, and patients will not have to leave their vehicles during the testing process. Tested individuals will receive post-test instructions at the clinic and test results will be available within five to seven days. Providing a testing clinic at the state fairgrounds will allow for both “efficiency and safety” as the county responds to the pandemic, Baltimore County Health Officer Dr. Gregory Wm. Branch said in a statement. County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. called testing “a critical component” in their efforts “to help reduce the spread of the virus and save lives.” “Increasing testing capacity in Baltimore County is part of our comprehensive effort to keep our residents safe and healthy during this crisis," Olszewski said in a statement. Baltimore County’s announcement comes a day after Maryland saw its deadliest day of the pandemic so far. Maryland’s confirmed number of coronavirus cases exceeds 10,000 and the death toll is more than 400. Maryland has been working to expand testing for the new coronavirus by collecting samples at several drive-thru sites opened over the last few weeks. Baltimore City, for instance, opened its first drive-thru testing center at the Pimlico Race Course last week. People with mild COVID-19 symptoms are encouraged to notify their doctor, but they should isolate themselves and self-treat at home unless they start having trouble breathing. Health experts believe there are many more cases than those currently confirmed by testing. Residents with questions or who need assistance can call the Baltimore County COVID-19 hotline seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 410-887-3816.

Carroll County’s ‘safety net’ struggles to help the most vulnerable during coronavirus crisis
.W
Even as social distancing, mandated business closures and recommendations to shelter in place designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus take their economic and psychological toll on small businesses and families across the state, the most vulnerable of the population are being affected even more. And the agencies and nonprofits that serve them are working to find ways to continue services, while keeping everyone involved healthy and safe. In Carroll County, closures have homeless people left with no place go during the day, food-insecure seniors have lost access to food bank distributions and waves of layoffs of hourly workers could be the tipping point for families that were only just making ends meet before the crisis. “A lot of the folks we are serving were already not in a good place before this happened,” said Brenda Meadows, executive director of The Shepherd’s Staff. “My greater concern is really down the road, even a couple months after we are past, when the restrictions are loosened, the individuals who were already having issues will be that much deeper in trouble.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has taken a number of actions to help slow the spread of the coronavirus that could also have severe economic impact on vulnerable people, including ordering bars and sit-down restaurants closed and, on Thursday, all indoor malls closed. By the evening of March 21, the coronavirus also known as COVID-19, the illness it causes, had resulted in 285 deaths in the United States out of some 24,000 who have tested positive, according to Johns Hopkins University, with two deaths and 190 confirmed cases in Maryland, and three cases in Carroll. Some of The Shepherd’s Staff’s usual services, such as emergency financial assistance with rent, are not needed at this moment thanks to Hogan’s halting evictions and water shutoffs, Meadows said, but she worries whether the nonprofit, which is privately funded, will be in a position to help everyone who needs it once the crisis passes. “At this point, the only thing I know for certain is we are going to need emergency funds to help people in the community,” she said. And given the likelihood that many more people will be in a financially precarious position than before social distancing and restaurant closures began, “The demand will be much greater than it has ever been before.” In the meantime, The Shepherd’s Staff is continuing with its other services as best as possible on an appointment-only basis. On March 19, they fulfilled orders for their blessings closet, which provides people with household goods such as trash bags, diapers and soap, by leaving them on their Carroll Street office porch for each person to pick up. But in an example of just how fast things are changing, by the next morning Meadows had already decided to shut down the blessings closet program until further notice. “The Shepherd’s Staff will be making virtual appointments for emergency only situations and our physical location will be closed,” a Friday morning news release read. “If you have an emergency, please call 410-857-5944 and leave a message that includes your full name and telephone number.” It’s also not clear what will happen with The Shepherd’s Staff’s annual Easter Basket drive, which had been in full swing. “We really don’t know what is going to happen with that program at this point, simply because we want people to be safe and we are asking people to not be out and shopping for non-essentials,” Meadows said. Updates on all The Shepherd’s Staff’s services will be available on their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/ShepherdsStaffCC or by calling 410-857-5944. Providing essential services while keeping everyone involved has been a major struggle for Carroll County Food Sunday as well, given that a significant chunk of the food bank’s clients are food-insecure seniors, placing them in the high-risk category for COVID-19 infection, according to Executive Director Ed Leister. And that goes for his staff as well. “Twenty-six percent of the people who come through Food Sunday are over 60 years of age,” Leister said. “All my volunteers are 75-plus years of age.” Leister made the decision to close Food Sunday until an alternative plan could be formulated for putting food into peoples’ hands without jeopardizing their health. “We are not going to let them come into our space,” he said. “The plan now is to do distribution from a truck the county will supply.” In a plan formally announced by Carroll County Government on Thursday evening, Carroll Food Sunday will be distributing shelf-stable, non-perishable foods to clients 10 a.m. through 1 p.m. March 24 and March 26 in the East Middle School parking lot. Clients with last names beginning with A through M are asked to come Tuesday, while those with last names beginning with N through Z are asked to come Thursday. All are asked to bring identification. All Maryland Department of Social Services locations, including Carroll County’s office at 1232 Tech Court in Westminster, have been closed to the public since noon Thursday, according to a Maryland government news release. All Department of Social Services programs — such as SNAP benefits, child support services and home energy assistance — are still functioning, according to the release, but those interest should call 1-800-332-6347 or visit ww.mydhrbenefits.dhr.state.md.us for help. But some of the service providers in Westminster’s Distillery building, Access Carroll and Human Service Programs of Carroll County Inc., are still open for business. Access Carroll, which provides health and dental care to low-income people, has taken it upon themselves to screen anyone entering the building for symptoms of the coronavirus, according to Executive Director Tammy Black, and while the clinic cannot test for COVID-19, they can test for illnesses that cause similar symptoms. “We have someone at the ground level screening people before they even enter the building to make sure they won’t bring in something in that can be treated outside,” she said. “We have actually done some screenings for strep and influenza A outside.” There were some of those with COVID-19-like symptoms, such as fever and a dry cough during the week, Black said, who tested negative for the flu or strep. They were asked to isolate at home. And for Access Carroll’s regular appointments, as much as possible, they are being conducted through remote video sessions, according to Black. “We started Monday with telehealth for behavioral health needs and [Wednesday] with the medical service lines,” she said. That’s not to say, however, that Access Carroll isn’t seeing patients in the building when it’s necessary, according to Black. They have, she said, been seeing a lot of emergency dental patients in the past week, helping to keep those patients out of the emergency department for a non-COVID-19-related problem. “If a patient were to walk in, we will do the screening at the ground level, but if they need to be seen for something, we will see them,” she said. “We are committed to those people. they are our purpose. We are a safety net." Human Services Programs, which operates Carroll’s emergency and homeless shelters, including the cold weather shelter, is another part of that safety net, according to Jennifer Graybill, director of shelter and housing — all of which she emphasized remaining open and operating. “We are not closing. We will not close. We are the county’s safety net and is our job to stay open,” she said. “We are in the crisis business, and this is when we are needed the most.” As with The Shepherd’s Staff, a freeze on evictions and water shut-offs has substantially decreased the foot traffic in HSP’s office, according to Graybill, but they are still open and meeting with people for other services, such as rapid rehousing. Getting people who are homeless into secure housing, she noted, is essential at a time when social distancing is important. “Landlords are afraid in this time they will not collect their rent. The good thing is we have funding right now to pay for some people’s rent and we want to house as many as possible. The less people in shelter, the better,” she said. “This can be life or death for some of our folks.” HSP staff are also going out to homeless encampments and touching base with people, Graybill said, sometimes just to provide information and human contact and reassurance. “Across the board we are seeing a lot of people who are terrified. They are unsure what the world is going to look like tomorrow,” she said. “Many HSP clients were already in crisis and dealing with substance use or mental health issues, so “this is a crisis on top of crisis they are experiencing.” That’s noticeable in the cold weather shelter, too, Graybill said, which normally sees about 20 clients per night at this time of year but has been seeing an average of 35 per night — and climbing — over the past week. “People are scared and they don’t want to be by themselves,” she said. “They are coming in for access to info to know what is going on.” Not only are HSP and the shelters remaining open, Graybill said, they are also hoping to expand services, repurposing the Westminster Senior and Community Center as a day shelter for people with no place to go now that the malls, libraries and other locations are closed. “We are very aware that all other agencies have closed and there is no place to go during the day for our participants, which is a concern,” she said. Working with the Carroll County Department of Citizen Services, HSP was able to open the Westminster senior center as the HSP Drop In Center on Friday. The 125 Stoner Ave. location in Westminster will be open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. seven days a week for homeless people, and will provide light activities and supplies, as available, according to a news release. The senior center is now the location for the cold weather shelter, according to Graybill. This will allow HSP to use the usual cold weather shelter location, across the parking lot from the senior center on Stoner Avenue, to be used as a quarantine shelter for anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms. “That would allow us to quarantine 25 individuals. We are praying this doesn’t happen, but that allows us to safely quarantine, where they have their own bathrooms, separate rooms,” she said. "We will not close shelter. I cannot say that enough. We will not close shelter." Given that commitment to continue to serve the vulnerable, Graybill said that HSP could use community help to sustain them in that mission. “Our most immediate need is for donations. We are going out every single day and buying cleaning supplies and buying food. People in our shelters will not go hungry, people in our programs will not go hungry,” she said. "If people can donate cleaning products, hand sanitizers since you can’t buy them anywhere, prepackaged food, and bottled water, would be incredible. And certainly we accept monetary donations." Hand sanitizers are especially important for homeless people at this time, Graybill added, since they do not always have ready access to soap and water as do people who are housed. “Deep Run Church gave us a huge donation of antibacterial hand wipes that we are giving out to all of our homeless encampments, but we don’t know how long this will last,” she said. Regardless, HSP isn’t going anyway. “It’s an honor,” Graybill said. “We’re happy to do it.” Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Baltimore pastor vows to continue services despite coronavirus-related restrictions and visit from police
.W
A prominent pastor is vowing to hold worship services this Sunday and beyond after Baltimore police tried to shut down a service at his church amid increasing coronavirus-related constraints on social gatherings. The Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr. said he was delivering a sermon Sunday to 10 worshipers when four patrol cars containing “eight or nine officers” pulled up in front of the Friendship Baptist Church and several tried to enter the building. Gwynn, the longtime senior pastor of the church on Loch Raven Boulevard, said security guards prevented the officers’ entry until he had finished his sermon. “You should have seen it, man, it looked like a police raid on a drug deal,” he said. When he spoke to the officers outside, one asked whether he had “read the governor’s order” — a reference to a directive Gov. Larry Hogan issued March 19 limiting the size of gatherings in the state to 10 people or fewer. When he asked officers to explain why they were there, Gwynn said, they looked “bewildered," declined to answer, and called a superior. Lt. Suzanne Fries had advised the officers on the scene to “shut down the gathering,” according to an incident report supplied by the Baltimore Police Department. “At this point, the church service ended and the crowd dispersed,” the report continued. That, Gwynn said, was when the patrol cars departed and his congregants left. Gwynn, 74, also serves as president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Metropolitan Baltimore, a group that includes the leaders of more than 50 churches. He said he limited the size of the gathering to 10 — the church’s five security guards were stationed outside the sanctuary — and ensured that those present had at least 6 feet of space between them, in compliance with guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the state health department. Attendance has been light in the weeks since coronavirus-related restrictions began, said Gwynn, who admitted worshipers Sunday on a first-come, first-served basis. A police spokeswoman, Detective Chakia Fennoy, said officers were responding to a report of a gathering in violation of the governor’s orders. It is unclear whether officers on the scene had an opportunity to assess the congregation’s compliance, but Fries’ decision to shut down the gathering came after Gwynn “advised [officers] that he will not be canceling any of his worship services in the future,” according to the incident report. Gwynn said he will hold services again this Sunday and beyond, including Easter, but will again limit the gathering to 10 people or fewer. “I’m not stupid,” he said. “I don’t want to go to jail. I’m more valuable to my community on the outside than the inside.” The police department declined to comment specifically on the incident, but cited its commitment to “working with our local and state partners in supporting the governor’s executive order.” “We encourage residents to call 311 with any nonemergency calls related to improperly open businesses or unlawful gatherings of crowds,” the department said in a statement. “Any officer that observes a business that is in violation of the governor’s executive order must investigate the complaint.” The department “remains focused on keeping the public safe and will continue to work closely with our local partners to serve city residents and to decrease the spread of COVID-19,” the statement continued. A defiant Gwynn clearly did not think much of that reasoning. He argued that under the Bill of Rights, the government cannot restrict either the size of gatherings for worship or a citizen’s right to attend a service. “Remember, we have the First Amendment, which guarantees our most fundamental rights,” he said. “Can the state stop people from coming out of their homes to worship? It’s a constitutional question. Congress can’t make laws governing worship or peaceful assembly. Our democracy wouldn’t be here if we didn’t have those rights.” Gwynn said he will continue conducting other ministries as well, including Saturday Bible study, as attendance easily fits under the 10-person limit. The pastor was concerned his decisions could raise further questions in the wake of the emergency stay-at-home order Hogan issued Monday. The order requires all those living in Maryland to stay home unless it’s to participate in “essential activities,” regardless of the size of the gathering. It defines those as “activities essential for the health and safety of one’s self, family, household members, pets, or livestock, including such things as seeking medical or behavior health or emergency services, and obtaining medication or medical supplies.” In a section that limits the size of gatherings, though, the order also appears to permit gatherings of 10 or fewer people. A statement from the governor’s office of legal counsel seemed to support “minimal” activity at houses of worship. “Churches, synagogues, mosques, and other similar religious facilities are considered ‘Non-Essential Businesses’ under the Order,” the statement read. “Clergy and other staff of those religious facilities are permitted to continue conducting Minimal Operations ... provided that they comply with all applicable guidance from the CDC and MDH regarding social distancing.” The Republican governor’s office could not be reached for comment, but the governor’s communications director, Mike Ricci, tweeted a response to a question about whether a group of five people would be in compliance if they assembled in church to record a pastor’s sermon for online use. “Yes. Churches may have those kinds of minimal operations,” Ricci replied. Gwynn pointed to a 2018 federal directive that appears to contradict Hogan’s decision to classify churches as “nonessential.” In June of that year, the CDC issued guidelines on how governments should respond in the event of widespread contagion. “The collaboration of faith-based agencies with public health agencies will be essential in protecting the public’s health and safety if and when an influenza pandemic occurs,” it reads. Fennoy said she could not comment on how police would deal this Sunday with the church, if at all, but the department statement said follow-up investigations of complaints on gatherings “will be conducted by our VICE team, who may shut down an establishment if it is found to be in violation.” Police Commissioner Michael Harrison did not comment specifically on the Friendship Baptist situation, but he said Tuesday that the department is prepared to enforce the stay-at-home order. So far, he said, most people are following the governor’s order. “When we find that people are not voluntarily complying, then the instructions will be to make a physical arrest," he said. “We are working very hard in a proactive way to get voluntary compliance.” Gwynn is no stranger to taking strong public positions. Days after the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray from injuries suffered while in police custody in 2015, in his role as alliance president, he was one of the first public figures to call for the resignation of then-Commissioner Anthony W. Batts. “We can no longer distinguish who is in charge of the police department’s day-to-day operations,” said Gwynn, who called Gray’s death “untimely and unnecessary.” Then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, a Democrat, fired Batts three months later. Gwynn said he believes his church is being singled out as an example at a time when government is asserting new powers as part of its effort to limit the spread of COVID-19. Gwynn added he has contacted Baltimore police several times seeking an explanation for last Sunday’s events, but no one has replied to his calls.

Baltimore Police order additional supplies, provide guidance to protect officers against the coronavirus
.W
Baltimore Police are ordering additional personal protective equipment for officers to use while responding to calls involving people who potentially have the coronavirus. “We’ve inventoried our personal protective equipment and have ordered additional supplies in order to have sufficient quantities available for all our members,” Michael Sullivan, deputy commissioner of operations, wrote in a memo dated Tuesday and obtained by The Baltimore Sun. The memo did not detail what personal protective equipment was being ordered by the department. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that law enforcement officers have access to a single pair of gloves, a “disposable isolation gown,” a particulate respirator, and eye protection, such as goggles or a disposable face shield. The two-page memo also included protocols officers should follow when responding to calls involving potentially infected patients. Baltimore’s 911 operators will question callers to screen for any potential exposure to the COVID-19 virus, the memo said. “In the event the caller meets the criteria, the dispatcher will notify responding personnel over the radio to ‘use universal precautions,’" it said. Police officers responding to such calls should, “if feasible, please wait for EMS personnel to arrive on-scene and be guided by EMS,” the memo said. EMS personnel are then expected to apply a mask to the patient to limit the dispersal of respiratory droplets. EMS personnel should “assess and transport anyone you think might have COVID-19 to a healthcare facility,” the memo said. Additionally, Sullivan said custodial staff at all department facilities would continually check the hand sanitizer and soap dispensers to ensure they are filled. Officers are being asked to regularly clean and disinfect equipment, such as their duty belt, and to disinfect steering wheels, door handles of patrol vehicles. Commissioner Michael Harrison said in a department-issued video that he has been in touch with Seattle’s police chief since the city in the state of Washington is “considered ground zero for COVID-19." He also said he has been talking with other police department leaders across the country to ensure the department is using best practices to minimize exposure. “Keeping every member of our department safe and knowledgeable of operating procedure remains my highest priority,” Harrison said.

Bishop Antonio Palmer and an Odenton church have a response to the coronavirus pandemic: service
.W
Bishop Antonio Palmer had one driving thought as the coronavirus pandemic began to consume day-to-day life in Maryland: How could his church, Kingdom Celebration Center in Odenton, help people where their needs were most intense? Palmer, in consultation with his wife and fellow pastor, Barbara — in his words “the brains behind all that is happening” — settled on two chief lines of service: child care and food distribution. “What we’re doing now is what we were doing before the pandemic, but it’s heightened,” said Palmer, who’s worked as a pastor since 1995. “What was going through my mind was: What can we do to pitch in with so many more people hurting?” In a community full of workers from Fort Meade and the National Security Agency, the Palmers knew it would be essential to preserve as many day care options as possible for parents who could not stay home. The church’s Kingdom Kare center had to trim staff (from 21 to eight) and limit services to the children of essential workers (about 25, down from the normal 80), but parents described its uninterrupted service as a godsend. “It’s stressful enough having to go to work every day, with everything going on with the pandemic,” said Jasmine Gore of Laurel, whose one-year-old daughter, Joy, attends Kingdom Kare. “Knowing that it was the people who had already taken care of her gave me big peace of mind.” Gore works as a nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital and her husband as a truck driver delivering supplies to grocery stores. She likes the homey atmosphere and constant updates offered by the church and would not have felt comfortable dropping her daughter at an unfamiliar day care center. “If they were to have closed, I would not have had child care, and Johns Hopkins would have been one nurse short,” Gore said. Meanwhile, Palmer’s modest-sized church, coordinating with hunger-prevention groups and other congregations from around Anne Arundel County, increased its food distribution from about once a month to at least once a week. Local restaurants pitched in. Kingdom Celebration Center received 5,000 pounds of seafood from the distributors at True World Group. Holly Farms Poultry gave 4,000 pounds of chicken. As many as 2,000 people a week from 41 different ZIP codes have relied on the service. The drive-through lines are staffed by dozens of congregation members. Palmer does his best to talk with every person. “You can feel their hearts — the burden just seems greater," he said. "And it doesn’t matter if they’re driving through in a Lexus or an old pickup truck. Everybody’s feeling this pandemic.” The church is also exploring the possibility of becoming a COVID-19 testing center. “To see that spirit touch the whole congregation so they’re saying, ‘This is what we’re called to do, to be a people who serve,’ that’s where my heart is,” Palmer said. “You feel the urgency now.” Know a hero? We want to hear about the essential workers and everyday people who are keeping the Baltimore area safe, fed and cared for. Submit your heroes at baltimoresun.com/heroes.

Baltimore County will open two coronavirus testing sites in Randallstown and Owings Mills next week
.W
Baltimore County is opening two additional coronavirus testing clinics beginning next week, the county announced. The clinics will test people who have a medical order from a health care provider, the county announced Friday. Once authorization is obtained, people must schedule an appointment using the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients, known as CRISP, which is the state-designated health information exchange. A drive-thru testing site will open at the Owings Mills Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program, at 11510 Cronridge Drive, and a walk-in clinic will open at the Liberty Family Resource Center in Randallstown, where the 21133 ZIP code is seeing the county’s highest concentration of coronavirus cases and where black residents make up 81% of the population. County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. said in a statement that these two new sites will give the county the capacity to perform "significantly more tests in the areas of the county that have been hardest hit by the virus.” Baltimore City also announced the addition of a third coronavirus testing site. The drive-through, appointment-only site opened Friday at Clifton Park, 2801 St. Lo Drive. It run by city and state health officials, the Maryland National Guard, and the Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management. And Howard County announced that it was increased the testing capacity of the site at the Columbia Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program to 146 tests a day, from 100. The site at 6340 Woodside Ct. is open by appointment to people with a medical order from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. People who arrive at test sites without an order from a health care provider or without an appointment will not be tested, health officials said. Baltimore County is opening the Owings Mills site in partnership with the Maryland Department of Health. The site will accept approximately 75 appointments per day, and be open Wednesdays and Fridays. The county’s first drive-thru site at the state fairgrounds, 2200 York Road in Timonium, also will accept 75 appointments per day and is open Tuesdays and Thursdays. The county health department’s walk-in clinic at the Liberty Family Resource Center at 3525 Resource Drive will accept approximately 20 appointments per day and will be open Mondays. “Staging test clinics in communities that report a high number of confirmed cases will help us identify people who need to quarantine to protect against infecting others," County Health Officer Dr. Gregory Wm. Branch said in the statement. People coming for testing are asked to adhere to safety guidelines, including wearing face coverings, observing social distancing and following post-test instructions received at the sites. For questions and additional information, call the Baltimore County COVID-19 Hotline seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 410-887-3816.

Nursing home in Roland Park in Baltimore says two residents died from coronavirus, nine others at facility tested positive 
.W
A North Baltimore nursing home said Thursday that two residents died of the coronavirus. Nine others, including residents and staff, also tested positive for the virus. Keswick Multi-Care Center, in the Roland Park neighborhood, said 28 symptomatic residents and staff were tested. Of those tested, 11 were positive, the nursing home said in a statement. The residents were isolated and placed in a separate unit to help prevent the virus from spreading. Staff who tested positive were required to quarantine at home for two weeks or until released by their physician. “Keswick has followed all procedures recommended by public health officials and we will continue to take all precautions, including the use of proper protective equipment, to keep the risk of infection as low as possible for other patients and for Keswick employees,” the nursing home said. Several weeks ago, the nursing home, at 700 W 40th St., said it implemented a no-visitor policy to the facility, in addition to a “strict infectious control plan has been in place for the protection of the entire campus community." Essential staff, vendors and providers continue to be the only ones allowed on the property, the nursing home said. All employees are also screened with temperature checks daily, the nursing home said, and residents have their temperature taken three times a day. A Northwest Baltimore nursing home announced Wednesday that 129 residents and 41 staffers tested positive for COVID-19, marking one of the largest known coronavirus outbreaks in the country. COVID-19 infections have now been reported in nearly two-thirds of Maryland nursing homes — 145 of 226 facilities, according to state officials. The New York Times reported Tuesday that coronavirus infections have been reported in 2,500 nursing homes and long-term care facilities across the country, with 21,000 people infected and 3,800 killed. Maryland has 10,784 confirmed cases of coronavirus, of those 392 have died.

People should be ‘vigilant’, keep children home if sick during coronavirus spread, Harford school officials say
.W
Harford school officials continue to monitor developments as the number of coronavirus cases rises in Maryland — including at least one confirmed case in Harford County — in an environment where “the information is just changing by the moment,” schools Superintendent Sean Bulson said Monday. Bulson addressed what he called “an evolving situation” with coronavirus, or COVID-19, during the Harford County Board of Education’s regular business meeting Monday evening. Board member Dr. Roy Phillips, a local physician, also discussed the virus that has been spreading around the world since it emerged in Wuhan, China several months ago. “I’m not infectious disease specialist, I’m not an epidemiologist, but we deal with this stuff every day,” said Phillips, who is an endocrinologist, a branch of medicine specializing in the multiple glands in the body, hormones and treating conditions such as diabetes. The superintendent emphasized that, “at this point,” Harford County Public Schools leaders have no plans to close schools or cancel major events. “It is still the expectation that our students, who are healthy, are in school,” Bulson said. “Our students who are sick should not be coming to school.” Anyone, whether a student, parent or HCPS staff member, should not come to school if they have a fever of 100 degrees or higher, according to Bulson. “Our basic guidance around that has been, it’s OK to return when you have been fever-free for at least 24 hours but [it is] even better when you’ve had some guidance from your healthcare provider, notably your doctor,” he said. Bulson was among the Harford County leaders who took part in a press conference Monday afternoon following an announcement from Gov. Larry Hogan on Sunday that a woman who lives in Harford County has been hospitalized with COVID-19. Hogan said the woman, 86, contracted the virus while traveling in Turkey, although the Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., disputed that claim Tuesday, saying she had been traveling from Albania to Dulles International Airport with a stopover at Istanbul Airport, according to border entry records. There have been six cases confirmed in Maryland as of Monday; other cases have been identified in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties. Maryland is under a state of emergency, and Hogan is convening a Coronavirus Response Team. The local government will continue to operate in a normal manner, County Executive Barry Glassman said during the Monday news conference. Local health officials are working closely with the Maryland Department of Health. Bulson said HCPS officials are “taking significant guidance” from the county health department, which is coordinating with state health officials. “In all cases, we’re deferring to the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” he said of the federal health agency. Bulson recommended people visit the CDC’s website for more information on COVID-19, noting that “they have great school guidance” on the site. Two main issues that have come up amid discussions about the virus on social media are handwashing — something many health officials recommend to reduce spread of the illness — and school attendance, according to Bulson. Central office leaders spoke with school principals Monday morning and emphasized the need for principals “to be very deliberately focused” on giving instructions and providing multiple opportunities for students to wash their hands. Principals also should communicate with the surrounding communities about the need for children to wash their hands, Bulson said. The superintendent said there has been much discussion in the national media about the benefits of closing schools versus keeping them open as coronavirus spreads. He said HCPS leaders are weighing concerns such as families who depend on schools to provide regular meals for their children, as well as any challenges parents face in their ability to watch children who have to stay home from school when sick. “Things are changing daily, and so we just encourage everyone be safe, use good judgement,” Bulson said. “We want our students in school if they’re healthy — we want them to stay home if they’re sick.” On Monday, Baltimore and Anne Arundel county school systems canceled all field trips outside of Maryland or Washington, D.C., in response to the viruses’ spread. Harford County Public Schools has not canceled field trips or events, said spokeswoman Jillian Lader, although school leaders have been directed not to schedule any new field trips or events. The John Carroll School, which planned to host a Holocaust remembrance day Wednesday, had to modify their programming. Holocaust survivors were scheduled to speak, but fears of the virus coupled with the vulnerability of senior citizens made them reconsider. With some speakers pulling out of the event, the school will instead show a selection of movies as well as an excerpt from a student-produced “Diary of Anne Frank," according to an email from Caroline Haggerty, an admissions marketing coordinator at the school. ‘Historical perspective’ on coronavirus Board member Phillips gave what he called “historical perspective” on COVID-19, which he said has infected about 500 people in the U.S. and caused 22 deaths, as of Monday morning. Phillips noted past epidemics and pandemics, such as the H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the global influenza of 1918, have resulted in many more infections and deaths than what has happened so far during the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 500 million cases, or one-third of the world’s population at the time, of influenza in 1918, with 50 million deaths, Phillips said. There were 61 million cases of H1N1 in the U.S. more than 90 years later; Phillips said H1N1 is a “sub-type of influenza A,” similar to the virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic — 274,000 people were hospitalized, with 12,500 deaths, from the latter disease in the United States. “H1N1 continues to be prevalent today; we’ve actually seen a number of cases during this year’s flu season,” Phillips said. “It is a type-A influenza and it is still one of the causes of the seasonal flu, of which we’ve seen a number of cases this year.” There were an estimated 49,000 deaths from seasonal influenza last year, and 20,000 to 50,000 people are expected to die during the 2019-2020 flu season, according to Phillips. He noted that, so far, 138 children and youths, “pediatric” patients, have died from the flu this year. The novel coronavirus has not shown up in many children so far, though. Phillips noted that some other strains of coronavirus cause the common cold, and children develop antibodies to the virus after being exposed. Antibody levels “tend to drop off a little bit” as people get older, though, which is why COVID-19 is more common among older people so far, he said. “I think we all need to be vigilant — we need to practice good hand hygiene,” he said, also recommending that people cough into their arms. People who are not sick should not buy face masks, which are intended for sick people so they do not spread the virus through airborne droplets expelled when they cough or sneeze. Wearing a mask will not do any good if a person is not sick, as “the droplets are going to get on your body one way or another,” Phillips said. “I just think we need to be careful,” he said. “If your kids are sick, keep them home; if you’re sick, stay home, which is good hygiene habits under all circumstances.”

Harford governments, hospitals prepared for coronavirus, urging citizens to follow CDC guidelines
.W
Harford County government and area hospitals have been preparing for potential coronavirus cases against the backdrop of three cases being confirmed in the state, county officials said. Government officials have been keeping an eye on the virus for weeks, Harford County spokeswoman Cindy Mumby said. With the Harford County Health Department taking the lead, Mumby said that county agencies have been in contact with each other and monitoring the situation. The county, she said, has plans for each constituent agency on how to continue operating during an emergency — either caused by the virus or any number of other emergencies that may impeded county services. Mumby said Harford is planning for the worst and hoping for the best. “The virus is new on the horizon,” she said, but, “the practice of being prepared for emergencies is something that we do every day.” The Health Department has established a joint information center with all public information officers in the county, said spokeswoman Molly Mraz. “All community partners are working together to establish consistent messaging throughout the county,” she said. “We are all in communication daily and are collaborating closely with the community partners and the Maryland Department of Health.” Harford’s health department has seen an uptick in calls related to coronavirus, but “nothing that is overwhelming at this point,” Mraz said. The department is tracking phone calls regarding COVID-19 and staff has been brief on how to answer these calls. Hospitals in Bel Air and Havre de Grace had already started preparations for the coronavirus dating back to January, said Dr. Fermin Barrueto Jr., senior vice president and chief medical officer for University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. “Essentially, everything from supply chain to clinical operations were being evaluated and several weeks ago, we already started our hospital incident command center, where we get everybody organized to be able to handle this virus,” he said. “We are not expected it to be a short event.” Signage that discusses COVID-19 has been posted to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center and Harford Memorial Hospital, and the protocol and triage process continues to evolve and change, Barrueto said. “Suffice it to say, there will be more restrictions and controlling of entry points into the hospital to help us better screen patients [and visitors],” he said. Thus far, there has been no rush of patients to the hospitals’ emergency departments with fears of coronavirus, Barrueto said, but “as more cases turn up, you can imagine the stress level may also increase.” “The hospital is here for everyone that needs us," he said, “but if people are sick and they have questions, calling their primary care provider, appropriately using urgent care centers and trying to keep the emergency department cleared to be able to service patients who really need emergency services is a tremendous help.” “If we overwhelmed with low-acuity patients, it will really make it more difficult for us to care for those that are sick,” he said. To prevent against the virus, Mumby said the county is recommending people follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s prophylactic guidelines. “We are following the lead of medical authorities. We are directing people to follow the guidelines of the CDC,” Mumby said. “Just reminding folks of the preventative measures: wash your hands, stay home when you are sick, cover your mouth when you sneeze.” The CDC advises regular hand washing, avoiding sick people and staying home when you are sick to stop the virus’ transmission. Symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC’s website. Most of the cases are mild, but 20 percent are severe and require hospitalization. There is no vaccine. Localities, too, are working with the county to keep citizens and themselves up to speed on the most recent developments. They have been sharing information with the county and passing on the CDC’s recommendations to avoid spreading the virus. “Aberdeen is working with our county and state officials to stay informed and plugged in to all the information coming down from the CDC,” Aberdeen Mayor Patrick McGrady said in a message. “I’m sure our community will be able to handle anything that comes our way.” Michael Krantz, Director of HR and Administration for the Town of Bel Air, said the town is posting information on the town’s social media and keeping citizens informed of doctor’s recommendations. “We are following the advice of the Harford County Health Department,” Krantz said. “Not being a medical expert, I think it is best we follow the advice from those experts.” Mumby said a crucial part of hampering the virus’ transmission is to keep up to date on accurate information. That also helps fight panic, she said. “Get your information from the CDC and the Harford County Health Department,” Mumby said. “It is important for folks to get their information from these sources.” The Harford County Public Library has created an online portal for information about coronavirus, which includes those resources as well as others, such as the World Health Organization, Harford County Public Schools, and University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. Three people in Montgomery County tested positive for the respiratory virus after they were exposed to it on an international cruise ship. Two of those people are a couple in their 70s, and the other is an unrelated woman in her 50s, Gov. Larry Hogan announced. All three showed mild symptoms, which were waning. State officials would not say where the three people traveled due to privacy concerns. Montgomery County health officials confirmed Friday the cruise was not affiliated with Baltimore. State officials are working to figure out who those three had contact with and if the virus could potentially spread. The malady has killed 3,000 across the globe and sickened over 100,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Aegis editor S. Wayne Carter Jr. contributed to this article.

.W
With older people and those with underlying health conditions at particular risk for the novel coronavirus, several local and national stores in the Baltimore area are designating special shopping times during for only those specific groups. Most of the dedicated hours are right after the retailers open, typically early in day, after their stores have been cleaned overnight. Here is a sampling of local and national stores in the Baltimore area with senior-specific hours: Giant Food Stores: Giant locations will be open only for customers 60 and older and those with compromised immune systems from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. daily, beginning Friday. Safeway: Safeway, like other Albertsons Company stores, will reserve its stores for vulnerable shoppers from 7-9 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday. Safeway has four locations in the Baltimore area. Whole Foods Market: All Whole Foods nationwide will open for customers 60 and older one hours before opening to the general public. There are 10 Whole Foods in Maryland, including two in Baltimore, one in Columbus and one in Annapolis. All of those locations are designated for seniors from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. before opening to the public. Target: The retailer with 20 Baltimore-area locations announced that its first hour each Wednesday (from 8 a,m, to 9 a.m. at most locations) will be reserved for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.

Boarman’s will be closed Thursday to restock and has yet to announce its designated hours for Friday. The Fresh Market: From 8-9 a.m. Monday through Friday, The Fresh Market will be open exclusively to at-risk costumers. The store has four Maryland locations, one each in Baltimore, Towson, Annapolis and Rockville. Roots Market: The market’s Clarksville and Olney locations will open an hour early Wednesdays (7-8 a.m.) and stay open an hour later Sundays (8-9 p.m.) for those who are 60 and older or immunocompromised.

Can Maryland residents attend religious services during coronavirus pandemic? Here are the new guidelines 
.W
When Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr., the longtime senior pastor of Friendship Baptist Church in Baltimore, decided to hold worship services even amid the social-distancing restrictions in effect across the state on Sunday morning, he drew attention to perceived ambiguities in the emergency orders Gov. Larry Hogan has issued to stem the spread of coronavirus. Gwynn limited attendance at his two regular Sunday services to 10 people, in keeping with state and federal health department guidelines, and says worshipers remained at least six feet from one another throughout. But that didn’t stop a member of the public from filing a report of a suspected illegal gathering, or Baltimore Police from arriving during one of Gwynn’s services to try to shut the gathering down. Among the questions Gwynn posed in the aftermath: does the stay-at-home order Hogan issued on Monday, which required Marylanders to stay in their homes except when pursuing “essential” duties, define religious activity as essential or non-essential? “Can the state stop people from coming out of their homes to worship?” Gwynn asked in one of the many interviews he held with local and national news outlets. “It’s a constitutional matter.” The governor’s office sharpened its positions on those and other questions Wednesday when its office of legal counsel published a revised set of guidelines in regard to worship practice during the pandemic. The directives, issued as an order of the governor, amend and restate the order of March 23 prohibiting large gatherings and events and “closing senior centers, and all non-essential businesses and other establishments, additionally requiring all persons to stay at home.” Here are its essential provisions. Are faith leaders and houses of worship permitted to hold in-person religious services? Under Wednesday’s order, clergy and other staff members of religious facilities may carry out religious services as long as they’re in full compliance with “applicable guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and the Maryland Department of Health” when it comes social distancing, limits on the size of gatherings and cleanliness. What specific conditions do the new guidelines address? The directive states that there may be no more than 10 people “inside the religious facility” during a given gathering, including clergy, staff and participants, and that those in attendance must maintain a distance of 6 feet between themselves and others present throughout the gathering. It prohibits physical contact between any individuals present, a ban that applies to liturgical practices customary to many faith traditions, from handshakes to the sharing of Holy Communion. “This [ban] includes, but is not limited to, collecting donations by basket or plate,” the directive reads. At least one provision promises conflict with Gwynn’s stated intention to carry out his reduced services at his church’s customary times (7:45 and 10:45 a.m.): It calls for at least a four-hour gap between the end of one in-person service and the beginning of the next. “The Religious Facility should be cleaned between services, in accordance with CDC cleaning and disinfection guidance,” the directive reads. Services conducted remotely are permitted. Does Hogan’s stay-at-home order, which limits outside visits to “essential” functions, permit Marylanders to attend religious services? The directive does not specify whether houses of worship are to be defined as “essential businesses,” but it does make clear that residents may attend such services, so long as they, and the gatherings, are in compliance with existing governmental guidelines. Religious facilities, it says, are generally permitted to carry out “minimal operations,” a term that “includes, but is not necessarily limited to, facilitating remote services.” Rev. Mark Bialek, the pastor of St. John Catholic Church in Westminster, should be happy with one other provision. Bialek held an impromptu “drive-in Eucharistic Adoration,” inviting parishioners to visit the church parking lot in their cars at 7 p.m. on March 15, where they could view the Eucharistic host, or consecrated bread, from distances of 6 feet or more. More than 120 vehicles showed up. It was one of several “drive-in” worship opportunities offered by churches during the pandemic, including a number of “drive-through confessions" offered by Catholic priests. Bialek was asked by the Archdiocese of Baltimore not to repeat the exercise, he says, on grounds that it could be considered a large gathering. The new directive reverses that interpretation. “Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other similar religious facilities of any faith,” the directive may conduct “drive-in” services, “where participants gather in their vehicles near the religious facility and participate in the service together by remote means,” so long as all present complies with existing restrictions on social distancing. Participants, for instance, will be barred from interacting physically with clergy, staff, or participants in other vehicles and having more than 10 people in a vehicle.

Maryland Senate passes emergency legislation to extend temporary unemployment benefits during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Maryland’s Senate passed emergency legislation Monday to extend temporary unemployment benefits to employees who will lose their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. With a 45-0 vote, the Senate approved legislation sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson and Sen. Clarence Lam, a Howard County Democrat, that allows the state to extend temporary unemployment benefits to workers who have to be quarantined or whose employers temporarily close. The legislation also makes people eligible for benefits when they have to leave their jobs due to risk of exposure or to care for an infected family member. The bill takes a number of other steps to address the pandemic’s impact in Maryland. It would cut costs for screening tests, improve access to telehealth services, prohibit price gouging and make it illegal for an employer to fire a worker because he or she is quarantined. “This is a perfect example why the legislative branch of government matters,” Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said. “I’m very proud to support this bill and the administration’s and members’ efforts to get through this crisis.” Sen. Kathy Klausmeier, a Baltimore County Democrat, noted the temporary unemployment benefits are badly needed now that Republican Gov. Larry Hogan ordered bars, sit-down restaurants, movie theaters and gyms to close Monday. “No one wanted to be in this situation,” Ferguson said. A House of Delegates version of the bill, sponsored by Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, is pending final approval. The legislation must pass both chambers before advancing to Hogan’s desk for his signature. It would become law as soon as it is signed.

Amid coronavirus fears, stocks of Maryland-based companies plunge with broader market 
.W
Maryland companies’ stocks plunged along with the rest of the market this week as investors worried about the uncertainty of coronavirus and its impact on the economy. A selloff in the stock market since Monday was triggered by increasing fears that the U.S. could experience the business, travel and daily life disruptions seen in China and elsewhere around the globe. And Maryland-based companies were not immune to the losses. The S&P 500 index fell 11.5 percent for the week, the worst performance in a week since the 2008 financial crisis. Most large public companies in the Baltimore region saw drops ranging from 7% to nearly 16%. “There is a lot of uncertainty,” said David I. Kass, a clinical professor of finance at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. “No one knows the degree that Americans or any company will be affected. ... There’s concern over, ‘How bad will this get?’ and ‘When will it end?’ " Baltimore-based Under Armour was among the first companies to discuss an adverse impact from the shuttering of factories in China, where 600 of its stores have closed. The sports apparel maker said earlier this month it expects a $60 million sales hit in the first three months of the year and possible interruptions in production and delays in shipments and sourcing of fabric, trim and packaging. In the past five days, shares of Under Armour fell 7.2% to $14.19 Friday. And in late January, Hunt Valley-based McCormick & Co. had warned of an unknown impact on operations in China, the spice maker’s second-largest market and site of three plants, including one in Wuhan, where the virus first appeared before spreading and sickening more than 80,000 people worldwide. On Friday, shares of McCormick were down 9.6% to $146.19 each. “Now it seems every company is mentioning that this coronavirus could have adverse consequences on their numbers,” including Apple, Microsoft, Hasbro and Mattel, said Jonathan P. Murray, managing director of UBS Financial Services in Hunt Valley. “It seems the selling this week has been indiscriminate; almost everything has sold off here in equities.” Another factor driving selling that has led this week to the market’s fastest 10% drop in history could be the rise of algorithmic trading, or use of automated programmed trading instructions to trigger hundreds of thousands of sell orders, Murray said. Kass said he believed the market sell-off to be an overreaction. “Most stock investors, I recommend, be long term,” he said. “Short-term traders and speculators I can see being concerned. I believe the coronavirus probably will be resolved for the most part in a year," after more medical interventions are developed and available. “The economy will start recovering and so would the stock market.” So far, no coronavirus cases have shown up in Maryland, where two people have tested negative and three more are undergoing testing. In the U.S., 62 people have tested positive for the virus. Kass said Maryland companies’ stock sell-offs, in line with the broader market, show “the market believes that they’re not any more vulnerable to the coronavirus than the rest of the economy on average." One exception this past week was Legg Mason, which announced last week that California-based mutual fund giant Franklin Templeton will acquire it for $50 per share in a $4.5 billion deal. Legg Mason’s shares fell just .9% to $49.82, possibly reflecting the acquisition price of $50 per share, a premium of $9.28. Local firms’ performance Some of the region’s largest companies ended Friday with shares down at least 7% in the past week, including: Chemical maker W.R. Grace & Co., down 8% to $56.56 per share. Money management firm T. Rowe Price, down 10.9% to $118. Tenable, a Columbia cybersecurity firm, down 7.7% to $24.52. Hunt Valley broadcaster Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., down 15.9% to $23.21. Corporate Office Properties Trust, down 14% to $25.34. Williams Scotsman, a modular space supplier, down 7% to $17.54. Laureate Education, international higher education company, down 9.1% to $18.70. Colfax, an industrial technology company, down 10.3% to $33.47. Ciena, a Hanover-based networking services firm, down 9.7% to 38.45. Medifast, a weight loss company, down 9.4% to $83.11. Omega Health Care Investors down 11.4% to $39.60.

Maryland woman who contracted novel coronavirus visited Albania, not Turkey, embassy says
.W
The Harford County woman who Maryland officials said contracted the novel coronavirus while traveling to Turkey only spent time in an airport there while traveling from Albania to Dulles International Airport, Turkish officials said Tuesday. Border entry records show the 86-year-old did not visit Turkey, but flew from Tirana, Albania, to Dulles on March 3 with a brief stopover in Istanbul Airport, according to the Turkish Embassy in Washington. She spent her entire time in the country in the transit lounge of the airport, officials said. Gov. Larry Hogan said that the woman contracted the virus while traveling to Turkey during a Monday news conference, in which he addressed the fourth and fifth confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Maryland. At the time, Hogan said it appeared to be the first case of the virus “anywhere in the world to be associated with travel to Turkey.” Mike Ricci, a spokesman for the governor’s office, tweeted “With regards to the Harford County resident who traveled to Turkey, we stand by what we have said.” Harford County health officials said the woman did not leave her house after she returned home from the trip until she started showing symptoms about six days later, when she went straight to the hospital, and that there was no danger to the community. Harford County Health Officer Russell W. Moy declined to say where the woman was being treated. Two other family members who drove the woman to the hospital are also in quarantine, Moy said. Neither was showing symptoms of the virus.

NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS closing access to locker rooms amid coronavirus scare
.W
The NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer are closing access to locker rooms and clubhouses to all nonessential personnel, including media, in response to the coronavirus crisis, the leagues announced in a joint statement Monday night. They said they made the decision “after consultation with infectious disease and public health experts.” The NBA, in a call with teams earlier Monday, stressed that the move is not to ban reporters but to ensure the safety of players and staff in those areas. The statement, in part, read: “Given the issues that can be associated with close contact in pre- and post-game settings, all team locker rooms and clubhouses will be open only to players and essential employees of teams and team facilities until further notice. Media access will be maintained in designated locations outside of the locker room and clubhouse setting.” The changes, which the leagues say are temporary, will begin Tuesday — though some NHL teams began putting them into use this past weekend and the Buffalo Sabres did the same on Monday night. The NBA said interviews with players would continue in different settings, stressing a gap of 6-to-8 feet between reporters and interview subjects. “I don't know that we have our arms around how significant of an issue this is at this point, so if the league is recommending or their policy is we want to take step by step type precautions, then we want to go along with that,” Texas Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. It is unclear how long the new policies will last. “No disrespect, but that's the last thing I'm worried about,“ Nuggets coach Michael Malone said prior to Denver's NBA game against Milwaukee on Monday night. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. “Roses are red, Violets are blue, Wash your hands! WASH YOUR HANDS!“ Enes Kanter of the Boston Celtics wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, there is already a clear sense of the new normal in the U.S. The Miami Heat held their annual gala at a theater in Miami Beach on Monday night, albeit a bit differently than usual. The team's three NBA championship trophies were near the entrance — with someone standing by with a bottle of hand sanitizer. And guests, when they arrived, were offered champagne by some attendants, more hand sanitizer by others. “Until the league says something else, we are business as usual with a tremendous amount of caution and prevention to make sure everybody's safe,” Heat President Pat Riley said Monday night. “But also, educating them that they've got to do the same thing.” The NBA held a call with team medical staffs later Monday night and scheduled a Wednesday call between league officials and team owners to discuss next steps. The NBA told teams last week to prepare for the possibility of playing games in empty arenas, something the game's biggest star — Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James — insists he does not want to see. “I doubt that that's going to happen,” Riley said. “But you have to be prepared.” MLB officials, like the NBA, held a conference call with all 30 of its franchises on Monday to discuss the new policies. All four leagues — and the NFL, which has been involved in the talks but isn't part of this policy since no teams are currently holding practices — are collecting information from the CDC and Canadian health officials, even as the situation changes almost on an hour-by-hour basis. “We are regularly conveying the guidance from these experts to clubs, players, and staff regarding prevention, good hygiene practices and the latest recommendations related to travel,“ MLB said in a statement. “We are continuing to monitor developments and will adjust as necessary. While MLB recognizes the fluidity of this rapidly evolving situation, our current intention is to play Spring Training and regular season games as scheduled.“ More than 113,000 people worldwide have tested positive for the disease and over 3,900 people with the virus have died, most of them in China. More than 62,000 people have already recovered. The virus has infected 600 people in the United States — including the director of the agency that runs the airports in New York and New Jersey — and at least 26 have died, most in Washington state. The Pro Basketball Writers Association quickly responded to the leagues' announcement by saying its membership “believes the safety of fans, players, team employees, arena workers and the media who cover the league must be protected. Our thoughts are with all people who already have been adversely impacted by the virus. “Therefore, we understand the NBA's decision to temporarily close locker rooms to everyone but players and essential team personnel with the NBA's promise that once the coronavirus crisis abates, the league will restore full access to the journalists who cover the league.” Some NCAA Division III men’s basketball games this past weekend were played without crowds because of concerns over the virus. At least one college hockey playoff series this coming weekend in Troy, New York, between RPI and Harvard also will be played without fans.

Confusion reigns supreme for voters, candidates in 7th District Congressional race complicated by coronavirus
.W
The governor and the candidates agreed. Despite the ever-tightening grip the new coronavirus continued taking on Maryland, the seat of the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings had been unoccupied for too long — and at a critical time. That’s what led Republican Gov. Larry Hogan to announce last month that the special general election for the 7th Congressional District seat, vacant since Cummings’ death in October death, would proceed April 28. One big accommodation was made: Due to the impending public health crisis, voters would cast ballots only by mail for the first time in Maryland. Now, with less than a month remaining until that date, confusion abounds. Not until Wednesday did state officials say the mailing of ballots to voters was underway. Meanwhile, social distancing measures at a print shop inside a state prison scuttled plans to print postcards advising voters of the changes to the upcoming election. And decisions about the logistics of the special election day itself are still changing, delaying messaging from candidates that could be crucial for first-time mail-in voters. “It’s getting so confusing,” said Republican nominee Kimberly Klacik, who has been in regular contact with state election officials. “We don’t know what’s going on at the top.” Anthony McCarthy, spokesman for Democratic nominee Kweisi Mfume, said he also was concerned about the lack of “emphasis” on the new election process. “A very important ballot is about to come in the mail. You’ll need to fill it out and return it,” McCarthy said. “It is my hope that the board, the state board, would do more to ring the bell, to let voters know that this is about to happen.” Both candidates are eager to spread that message. But in the absence of sample ballots, which only became available Wednesday, they couldn’t even prepare to disseminate the details of the election. Normally, sample ballots are available from elections offices months before voting day. The actual ballots have yet to appear in the mailboxes of the more than 500,000 registered voters in the district, which includes portions of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County. Nikki Charlson, deputy administrator for the State Board of Elections, tried to assure anxious leaders Wednesday in a state Board of Public Works meeting. She said that ballots were being mailed Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. That gives voters less than a month to return their ballot or — if theirs doesn’t arrive — update their address with elections officials, request a ballot and return a completed one by mail. Charlson said the elections board has a public relations firm working on voter outreach. Her remarks were met with skepticism. "I am highly skeptical about the ability of the state to pull off a mail-order election,” said state Comptroller Peter Franchot, a Democrat. Perhaps the most rapidly shifting piece of the puzzle involves in-person voting centers. Last week, Klacik said elections officials told her earlier that three in-person voting centers would be offered. But the state Board of Elections decided last week against such an option for the April 28 election for public health reasons, and indicated it would not offer voting centers in June, either. Since then, voting rights groups have urged elections officials to reconsider, arguing the voting centers are needed to serve people with disabilities and inactive voters who cannot easily receive mail. On Tuesday, state Senate President Bill Ferguson and Speaker of the House Adrienne A. Jones wrote a letter to Hogan, urging him to require voting centers for the June primary. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, a Republican, echoed their concerns during the Board of Public Works meeting. “I’m not sure this addresses all the issues,” he said of the plan for the 7th District race. The Board of Elections will meet Thursday to finalize its plan for the June 2 primary, and could reconsider its position on in-person voting. However, Linda Lamone, the state’s elections administrator, reiterated Wednesday that poll workers at voting locations would be at great risk. Hogan has the authority to override the board’s decision about in-person voting in the 7th District. However, if he did, the change in procedure would not be reflected on the instructions being mailed now with the ballots. “It’s not the most ideal situation," Hogan said Wednesday during a WBFF-TV interview when asked about the mail-only election. "But it’s better than having nobody representing the area in Congress all the way through until next year.” All the confusion has essentially put campaigning on hold. The virus ended all public campaign events and canvassing for both candidates, relegating both to social media. Klacik has been more active, posting health-related messages and videos almost daily. She spoke out on Twitter and Facebook against in-person voting, calling it an attempt at cheating by Democrats. “Can you imagine if at one of those polling sites, 50,000 people showed up to vote on April 28?” Klacik asked during a video she posted March 24 on Twitter. “You could be standing in line next to someone infected with coronavirus. How would you know? You could actually take your mail-in ballot and drop it in a post office box on your way to vote, allowing an individual to vote twice.” Mfume shared his own video this week on Twitter and Facebook, calling it a personal rather than a political message. He urged voters to practice social distancing and check in on those who live alone. “Please take care, hang in there,” he said. “Do what we have to do so we can all get through this. And we’ll get past this together.” Once the logistics of the 7th District race are finalized, the candidates will have a limited window to communicate with voters. McCarthy said all options are “on the table” to help voters understand the process, including social media, mailings and television advertising. Klacik said such messaging presents a challenge for her campaign, which has seen fundraising efforts severely curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. Mfume, who previously held the 7th District seat for a decade, has huge name recognition, and that’s hard to overcome, Klacik acknowledged. She hopes the Maryland Republican Party will step in to help. “We’ll do mailers, and we’ll do the overnight text messages, but I just not sure if we have the money to do a commercial,” she said. The challenges of the special election won’t end on April 28. Elections officials are preparing for a lengthy vote-counting process. “With the volume of ballots involved, it will take longer to do that than normal,” Charlson told state elections board members last week. The board may be asked to consider an extension of the normal 10-day window to do the official canvass of the votes, she said. She also reminded board members that the process typically requires employees to work together in the same room, close to each other, which could be another challenge. State officials also are working to collect high-speed scanners needed to count the ballots. Currently, Howard County has one, while Baltimore County and Baltimore City each have two. Charlson said officials are looking at borrowing scanners from other counties and supplying two more from the state. Even with that technology, voters can expect a lengthy wait before learning the results. Washington, one of several states across the country that conducts elections by mail only, took a week last month to tabulate its primary results.

Blubaugh: One bright spot that could result from coronavirus outbreak? The end of the handshake.
.W
The coronavirus is a serious issue, with more than 100,000 cases and some 3,500 deaths worldwide. A state of emergency was declared in Maryland after the three first cases in the state were announced. Everyone’s thoughts are with those affected, wishing speedy recoveries, and we all hope it can be contained as best as possible. Maybe some good can come out of COVID-19, however. For example, perhaps this will lead to improved hygiene. The top recommendation from the Maryland Department of Health for preventing the coronavirus is to wash your hands frequently. Did people really need a possible pandemic to realize this? Apparently so. A Michigan State University study found that only 5% of people wash their hands long enough to kill germs after using the bathroom, with 10% not washing at all and 33% failing to use soap. Also, maybe this will help all those amateur political pundits understand the stock market a bit better. The market is affected by myriad factors, real and perceived, from all over the world. It isn’t controlled by the president of the United States. President Trump was getting way too much credit when the Dow was flirting with 30,000 and, while he can be blamed for other things, he shouldn’t take a hit for the fastest market correction since the Great Depression. But here’s the best thing that could come out of this: The end of the handshake. It’s believed the handshake began as a peaceful gesture to show neither person was carrying a weapon and thus shouldn’t be feared. These days, we shake hands as a gesture of friendship or out of respect when meeting someone new or to denote an agreement has been reached. Or simply out of habit. But experts are urging us not to. Infectious disease specialists liken our hands to Petri dishes and the longer the contact between hands, the better the chance of transferring germs. As the coronavirus spreads, we’re supposed to avoid handshakes like, well, the plague. This practice should’ve ended long ago anyway. It just feels awkward. It’s not obvious when or whether to initiate. And if you wait too long to extend your hand and the other person is no longer paying attention, you look and feel as if you’re being snubbed. You want to be firm — manly, even — but not so firm as to make it painful on the other person. And when your hand is engulfed by a mountain of a man, you can’t help but feel like you’re 8 years old again, forced to shake hands with an adult. And these days, it’s unclear whether it’s just going to be a handshake or whether it’s going to turn into the even more awkward man-hug. (Don’t get me started on hugging.) Of course, the biggest problem with the handshake is exactly why it’s being discouraged. You never know where the other person’s hand has been. We’re not assuming the worst about potential scratching within the nose or anywhere else, nor are we even considering trips to the bathroom that end without washing (although, again, apparently that’s a problem). But how about the germs Mr. Hand just picked up from a cellphone or steering wheel or door handle or pet? According to Digital Trends, the dirtiest places in a home are, in order, a sponge, a video game controller, a coffee reservoir, a toothbrush holder and a cutting board. (Note to self: Never again shake hands in the kitchen.) It’s that easy to get germs on your hands. And the best way to pass them along to others is by sticking your hand out as if to say, “Put 'er there.” So experts are telling us to stop this outdated tradition as a way of keeping COVID-19 from spreading. As an added bonus, all manner of microbes won’t be spread, keeping us safer from the flu or E. Coli or Staphylococcus. What to do instead? A high-five is better than a handshake thanks to a shorter duration of palm contact. But a fist bump is far preferable, completely eliminating the palm from the process. Yet the hand is still involved and, again, the hand is pretty disgusting. Elbow bump? Better still, but, let’s face it, if people aren’t sneezing into their hand, they’re sneezing into their elbow. Plenty of germs hang out at that joint. Can we just agree on the chest bump? You’ve seen athletes do it when being introduced before a game or celebrating a big play. No hands involved. No skin-to-skin contact. No passage of germs. The next time you meet someone or run into an old pal or want to seal a deal, don’t extend your right hand. Crouch, activate your leg muscles and leap chest-first, making solid contact, though not enough to knock down the stranger/friend/business associate. Let’s make chest-bumping the new normal. No more awkward, disgusting handshakes from this day forward, OK? No, we don’t have to shake on it. Bob Blubaugh is the editor of the Carroll County Times. His column appears Sundays.

As first Maryland patient is tested for new coronavirus, response will be based on past outbreaks
.W
A Maryland resident is being tested for the new coronavirus that has sickened thousands and killed dozens in an outbreak that began in — and remains centered in — China, state health officials announced early Monday night. It’s the third time in 18 years that a serious coronavirus outbreak has made its way to the United States, with the fifth confirmed case reported Sunday in Arizona. The new coronavirus has sickened 2,886 so far, mostly in China, and killed 106. Maryland has no confirmed cases, but state health officials said that a resident, whose name and location were not identified, met the criteria for testing and is in good condition awaiting the results. Public health officials and researchers, who never stopped preparing for the threat that a new form of the virus could emerge, are responding to this latest outbreak using the past as their guide. “We predict these things can occur, though it’s always unexpected when they do,” said Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher and associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “We hope that the knowledge base from studying SARS and MERS is helpful in studying and responding to this one.” SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, originated in Asia in 2003 and sickened 8,000 people and killed about 800. Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It sickened almost 2,500 and killed more than 850 and continues infecting people. Officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say for now that the risk to Americans remains low from this coronavirus, which is part of a family of pathogens that also includes the common cold. But federal agencies have followed past protocols by opening an operations center, offering guidance to medical providers and screening people arriving from China at five U.S. airports. Samples from those suspected of being infected are sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing when the patient meets certain criteria, including showing respiratory symptoms and having traveled from China in the past two weeks. They also might qualify for testing if they have been in close contact with someone who has traveled and is sick. “The Maryland Department of Health is closely monitoring the rapidly changing situation with 2019 N-CoV, both in the U.S. and in China,” said Fran Phillips, the state’s deputy secretary of public health, in a statement. “As we learn more, Marylanders are encouraged to practice everyday actions to promote good health and to protect yourself and your loved ones from respiratory viruses like the coronavirus — wash your hands thoroughly, cover your cough and avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home from work or school if you’re not feeling well.” The five U.S. cases confirmed by the CDC are travelers from China to Arizona, California, Chicago and Seattle. On Monday, the CDC said health officials were investigating more than 100 potential cases in 26 states, which did not include the potential Maryland case, reported early at night. Testing will show whether they are the new coronavirus or another infection. Public health officials say there are less severe and far more common coronaviruses and influenza viruses now circulating and producing similar respiratory symptoms. There are other precautions locally, including messages to students and faculty at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University to call, not visit, a medical provider if they experienced flu-like symptoms after traveling to China. MedChi, the state association for doctors, is recommending medical providers screen anyone who has traveled to China and report suspected cases to local health departments. At least one local Chinese New Year celebration in Howard County has been canceled as a precaution. China has taken far stronger measures. Travel from the outbreak epicenter in Wuhan is restricted, Chinese New Year events have been canceled and officials are building a 1,000-person hospital to quarantine and treat those infected. Maureen Regan, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Health, said Friday that local health departments and medical providers began calling the state health officials last week for guidance on potential cases. At the time, none of those cases met the criteria for an infection, she said. That includes a passenger taken off a plane at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport on Saturday. Regan said the department is providing information and updates online. It’s also sent a letter to medical providers and local health departments and will rely on “a network of established communications and response protocols and resources” should there be a need in the state, she said. There is still much that researchers don’t know about the new virus, Frieman said. Coronaviruses are carried by animals and passed for poorly understood reasons to humans. MERS was passed from camels, for example. Some viruses then transmit between humans, some more easily than others. Frieman’s scientific work has aided in the development of treatments for both SARS and MERS. He’s now turned his attention to the new virus, which for now doesn’t appear to be as severe. Most people who have died so far have been elderly or suffering underlying health conditions. Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, director of the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development, is already working directly on a vaccine for the new virus. She co-leads a consortium established by the National Institutes of Health at Emory University in Atlanta to quickly tackle new infectious diseases. Neuzil said researchers will be prepared for an initial trial of a vaccine in the next three months, a timeline normally unheard of for any therapy. She said the vaccine will use an existing vaccine as a basis, or “platform,” for the new vaccine. Neuzil wouldn’t say what that platform might be. But the Norway-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a public-private coalition founded in 2017 to fund and coordinate quick vaccine development, announced Thursday that the platform will be based on the MERS vaccine. Specific researchers and manufacturers have been tapped for this rapid development and production, which is possible only because of research already done, Neuzil said. “The emerging influenza viruses over the years and other emerging coronaviruses have given us a higher level of preparation that we can now leverage and test with this latest emerging virus,” she said. In addition to development of therapies, others in Baltimore also continue contributing to global preparedness. Lauren Gardner, a civil engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University, led a team that built a map based on information collected from various sources in China, the United States and elsewhere to track the spread of the virus. The map will help the public visualize where the virus is taking hold in real time, while the underlying data can be used by researchers. Gardner, also co-director of Hopkins’ Center for Systems Science and Engineering, is now using the data to predict where there might be more cases and where public health officials should focus resources. The effort is similar to modeling she did last year that identified 25 countries most likely to experience a measles outbreak. “This is not supposed to make people afraid or worried,” Gardner said. “We made the map for the public to understand something that is still largely unfolding on the other side of the world, to give them timely and reliable information.” She said past outbreaks might be the reason that the data is so readily available. China has come under criticism initially for possibly withholding information about the number of people infected, but the nation’s health agencies shared data about the virus quickly, which led to timely gene sequencing of the virus. That information, in turn, is being shared by researchers and will be used to develop therapies, including the vaccine. The information also will help public health leaders respond. Already, different countries have come a long way in setting up systems to contain the threats and treat the infected, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist in Hopkins’ Center for Health Security. She helped develop the Global Health Security Index, which ranks 195 countries’ preparedness and aims to spur leaders to fill gaps in their response systems. Nuzzo got the idea for the index after seeing the quick response to another index that assesses nuclear materials security. The health security index ranks such things as a country’s ability to detect a public health threat and respond. That includes having a lab able to test large numbers of patient samples in an emergency, for example. The index also looks at a country’s health systems readiness, ability to provide safe and secure care, and even the level of trust the public has in the government. The United States generally ranks high in most categories, though below other countries for health care access, she said. A growing problem might be misinformation, such as that from vaccination critics spread easily through social media. Nuzzo also said China does well in the index, though not as well as other wealthier countries because it’s not always been transparent. “If we don’t know the state of preparedness, if people don’t even know who to call, it’s not a good state of preparedness," she said. “We’re living this now with China. The rest of the world is hinging on what China is sharing internationally. In this case, we have no reason to think they aren’t being transparent. There is worldwide attention on this."

MTA bus driver in Baltimore diagnosed with coronavirus; agency closes Eastern Division, affecting routes
.W
A Maryland Transit Administration closed the Eastern bus division in Baltimore after one its drivers for the new coronavirus. The Maryland Department of Transportation and the MTA, in a release, confirmed the driver’s diagnosis, first disclosed by the president of the local union that represents drivers. “MDOT MTA is working with health officials for formal verification," according to the release. “The operator last reported to work six days ago on Thursday, March 19. Buses are disinfected daily. Out of an abundance of caution, MDOT MTA has closed the Eastern bus division so that it can undergo a thorough cleaning and disinfecting.” Michael McMillan, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1300, said MTA Administrator Kevin Quinn called him about 10 p.m. Tuesday to inform him that a driver had tested positive for the new, highly contagious respiratory illness. McMillan said Tuesday night the MTA was not doing enough to protect other staff and riders in light of the driver’s diagnosis, and hasn’t been doing enough to keep drivers safe for weeks. Quinn would not identify the driver to McMillan but said she worked out of the Eastern Division, on Eastern Avenue. Buses traverse the city from there and go into the surrounding county, McMillan said. The routes affected by the closure include: » CityLink Navy, Orange, Blue, Pink, Lime and Gold » LocalLink 21, 22, 28, 36, 56, 59, 62, 63, and 65 » Express BusLink 105, 120, and 160 Dozens of out-of-service buses could be seen Wednesday parked at the Eastern Division lot. The shutdown disrupted travel for many people going to and from work or gathering groceries. Outside the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, the service interruptions cost Linda Wise hours of her day — and she still didn’t feel like the MTA had taken enough precautions to safeguard passengers’ health. Wise wheeled a cart with reusable grocery bags under a bus-stop awning, out of the drizzling rain, and checked her phone to find out when the next CityLink Orange bus would arrive. “Thirty-eight minutes,” she said. “That’s if it comes.” Wise, a 32-year-old mover and hauler, said she usually could take one bus, LocalLink 62, from her home in Turner Station to Essex, where she was headed to pick up groceries and toiletries from a free food pantry offered by Essex United Methodist Church. Because the 62 was one of several routes interrupted Wednesday, Wise had to take the CityLink Navy to Highlandtown, catch the Blue a few blocks to Bayview, then get on the Orange to Essex. “The total of just an hour ride turns into about four hours for me,” Wise said. “The bus schedule’s really messed up from this.” James Chisholm was waiting for a late LocalLink 22 bus on Eastern Avenue to take him to a doctor’s appointment Wednesday. “Otherwise,” he said, “I’d have been in the house.” Chisholm, 55, lives off North Avenue in East Baltimore and mostly takes the 22 and the CityLink Red. Every time he boards a bus, he wonders how well Maryland’s transit system is protecting riders from the coronavirus. “By them putting everybody on the back of the bus, it’s crowded,” he said. “The bus driver’s safe, but the passengers are not, cause they’re still sitting together.” City Council President Brandon Scott said the division where the driver worked must be closed “until fully cleaned." He also said MTA should identify everyone the operator was in contact with “to ensure they get the medical attention and information needed,” and that all operators are provided with necessary protective gear. “It is unacceptable that they don’t have what they need now,” he said. McMillan said he has been asking the MTA for three weeks to supply drivers with masks and other protective gear, and asking them to introduce measures at the divisions and on buses to emphasize social distancing practices. Still, drivers have no equipment, he said, and social distancing measures — including the one urging riders to board through the rear door — have failed. While Gov. Larry Hogan has said no more than 10 people should be in a room at the same time anywhere in the state, buses are still routinely filling up with as many as four times that figure. “Operators have been taking buses out with 20 to 40 people on a bus at any given time, and there is no way for the operator to police it themselves at all,” McMillan said. “Nobody is advocating for a total shutdown at all, but we want to do our part to flatten that curve.” McMillan said Quinn met with him a month ago to assure him the MTA would do everything in its power to quarantine sick employees and isolate others they came into contact with in the event a coronavirus case was identified among staff. He also said facilities would get a deep clean. However, McMillan said that was not happening Tuesday night. “They’re going back on their word,” he said. Right after he got off the phone with Quinn, McMillan said he drove to the Eastern Division, and things were carrying on as usual. He said one person was at the facility and “was taking Lysol wipes that you can buy from the Giant, and was wiping one surface at a time.” The union has about 3,000 members. There are four bus divisions. At peak times, there can be as many as 40 bus operators working in a division at a time, McMillan said. The MTA should have had a crew there to “clean it from top to bottom,” and a team from the health department to “find out who this operator has been in contact with,” he said. “I’m trying to stop a spread,” McMillan said. “They don’t know what to do or how to do it.” Instead, McMillan said another top MTA administrator called him, told him he shouldn’t be telling operators about their colleague’s diagnosis, and “threatened the operators and the mechanics” in the division — “that if they refuse to work at this time, in this contaminated division, that disciplinary action would be taken against them.” The department did not respond to questions about McMillan’s claims.

First Maryland inmate dies of coronavirus as Baltimore State’s Attorney Mosby ramps up calls to release some inmates 
.W
A man in his 60s became the first inmate to die in the Maryland prison system as the total number of prisoners and staff to contract the coronavirus neared 100, the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services announced Monday. The inmate died Saturday at the Jessup Correctional Institution and had been hospitalized for several weeks, the department said. He had underlying health conditions and was one of 10 inmates at Jessup diagnosed with COVID-19, officials said. Jessup has 33 confirmed cases among inmates, officers and contract employees, the most of any facility in the state. Besides the 10 inmates, 13 correctional officers and 10 contract employees have tested positive for the virus, the department said. The second-most confirmed cases came from the Maryland Reception, Diagnostics and Classification Center in Baltimore, according to numbers from the department. So far at least 93 inmates, officers and other employees have tested positive for the coronavirus. Attorneys and health officials in Baltimore and around the state have repeatedly called on Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan to act swiftly to release older or non-violent inmates as the outbreak spreads. In mid-March, experts said that “jails and prisons promote spread” due to the close contact inmates have with each other in the facilities. Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has been among the most vocal advocates calling for release, and on Monday again sent a letter to Hogan asking him to start reducing the prison population of low-risk and elderly offenders who may be more susceptible to contracting the virus. Mosby and medical professionals sent a similar request to Hogan on March 23, saying the governor’s “inaction on this issue is putting the lives of Marylanders at risk." Additionally, more than 200 medical department staff at Johns Hopkins University have made similar requests while challenging prison officials to adopt best practices for containing the spread inside prison walls. Those practices include more sanitizer and better access for prisoners to soap and water. The Hopkins letter demands that intake screening protocols for new inmates be updated with COVID-19 specific questions and policies. Maryland prison officials confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus on March 30, saying one inmate and two non-correctional contract employees at two different facilities. Now, there are a total of 93 confirmed cases in the Maryland correctional system, a significant jump after the department confirmed 57 cases on Friday. The department is not releasing “numbers specific” to inmates being on quarantine or isolation’ in any state facility, according to spokesperson Mark Vernarelli.

While Trump dithered, Maryland’s Hogan and other governors stepped into leadership role in coronavirus pandemic
.W
As a new coronavirus spread through the country in late February, President Donald Trump repeatedly dismissed the threat. “Within a couple of days, it’s going to be down to close to zero,” Trump predicted Feb. 26. The next day: “It’s going to disappear, one day. It’s like a miracle.” While Trump dithered in denial ― and infections and deaths from the pandemic rose ― a different style of leadership was taking place in Annapolis. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican like Trump, was becoming increasingly alarmed by the spread of the virus. Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association, convened a briefing for the nation’s governors of top physicians, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda. What Fauci told Hogan convinced him many people would die unless government leaders started taking serious and arguably draconian steps. “Dr. Fauci gave us really clear, really concerning facts. We weren’t hearing anything like that from the White House," Hogan said Friday in an interview with The Baltimore Sun. Hogan formed a team of epidemiologists and doctors from Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland, and MedStar Health to advise him and submitted emergency legislation to allow him to tap into the state’s reserve fund to prepare for the pandemic. On March 5, when the first three cases of the virus were discovered in Maryland, Hogan declared a state of emergency, more than a week before the president did the same. “I’m listening to some of the smartest scientists,” Hogan said. “We have a phone call every day and they give us staggering data about what could happen if you don’t take action. If you don’t take action today, people are doing to die. I don’t want to wait around.” Across the country, governors, mayors, business leaders and sports leagues have stepped in to fill what many have seen as a leadership void coming from the Trump administration, particularly in the early days of the pandemic’s spread in America. Hogan and Maryland officials have been among the first in the country to take a number of dramatic steps. Maryland was the second state to close public schools, just moments after Ohio did. Maryland was the third to close senior centers, bars and sit-down restaurants, and just the fifth to declare a state of emergency. To be sure, Hogan hasn’t pleased everyone. Some objected to his decision to quickly close many businesses, while others argue he could have taken even more severe actions to prevent spread of the disease. But for the most part, Hogan is drawing praise even from those who are often his critics. “The state is reacting better than almost any state in the country to the coronavirus pandemic," said Del. Eric Luedtke, a Montgomery County Democrat who is House majority leader. “I personally think the governor has been doing a fantastic job responding to it.” Sen. Clarence Lam, a Howard County Democrat and a doctor, wrote one of the emergency pandemic bills that, among other measures, extended unemployment benefits to people who lose their jobs because of the disease. A frequent Hogan critic, Lam said the state’s response has been “thoughtful and measured." “We have some good folks who are advising the governor on how to proceed on measures that make sense from both a public health standpoint and a community and governance standpoint,” Lam said. Lam noted Maryland hasn’t necessarily been the first state to take any one action, but has been ahead of most states. “These are difficult decisions that need to balance the needs of the economy with science and public health,” he said. Mike O’Halloran, state director of the small business group the National Federation for Independent Business, said businesses are struggling greatly during the crisis. But most understand why temporary closures are necessary. “We understand the governor did it with the idea of being reasonable and responsible,” O’Halloran said, adding that many restaurants appreciate Hogan’s executive orders that permit take-out service and the delivery of alcohol. “These are unprecedented times. We appreciate what the administration has done to mitigate some of the hardship.” As he listens to a briefing from the public health experts each morning, Hogan lets his team of senior advisers debate which step to take next ― before quickly making a decision. “We made hundreds of decisions as soon as we get the information,” Hogan said. “I’ve been erring on the side of acting as quickly as possible. This might sound weird, but in a crisis, if you wait until you’re sure you’re making the right decision, you’re probably waiting too long.” Since declaring the state of emergency, Hogan has held 10 news conferences and has appeared on national television 11 times, including on channels with greatly varying audiences, such as MSNBC and Fox News. He’s scheduled to appear Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” for a second time this month. During his first four-year term in office, the governor generally turned down national media appearances. Hogan said he feels a duty to communicate as much as possible now. “The public needs to hear the things I’m saying,” the governor said. “The more I can get my face in front of the camera telling the truth, the better. Unless we get people to understand this is a crisis, we’re not going to be successful.” In appearances and news conferences, Hogan has struck a balance between conveying urgency and hope. He’s been stern ― chastising some Marylanders for treating the crisis as “spring break” ― while also seeming eager to inject optimism where he can. Like a coach urging players to rally, Hogan said at one State House news conference: “We are all in this together, and if we all do our part to rise to this challenge and to meet this moment, we will get through this together.” While he has criticized the federal government for its response, he hasn’t singled out Trump by name. In a Fox News appearance Thursday after a White House conference call with state executives, Hogan said: “I want to compliment the president and the vice president for really great communication with the governors.” Nathan Volke, a Republican member of Anne Arundel County Council, said Hogan’s approach “is what people are looking for: ‘Stop the blame game and tell me how you’re going to fix it.’ ” Hogan’s spokesman, Mike Ricci, says the governor has three communication goals: Be accurate and aggressive in getting information out, explain what he’s doing and why, and respond to questions as much as possible. Political fights have to be brushed aside, Ricci said. “What I’ve heard the governor say over and over again is, ‘We’re going to be honest and level with the people,’ ” he said. “There’s no spin or polish. That goes out the window in a crisis.” Maryland’s Democratic legislative leaders, Senate President Bill Ferguson and House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, have joined the governor in making announcements and signing emergency legislation. Hogan said he’s learned to surround himself with good people, but also to trust his gut in times of crisis. And he’s absorbed the valuable lesson that it’s best to go bold when things are breaking bad. Just months after Hogan took office in 2015, the state was confronted with arson and looting in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray in city police custody. Hogan had to learn to manage a crisis and quickly send in the National Guard. When corruption overtook the Baltimore City Detention Center, Hogan shut the jail down. When a self-dealing scandal broke out at the state’s largest hospital network, the governor immediately called for resignations and reform. The crisis the state is now facing from the pandemic is much greater than the unrest that gripped Baltimore early in his tenure, Hogan says. “This is a much bigger, much harder crisis,” the governor says. “This is like nothing we’ve ever seen.” During the outbreak, Hogan has “projected a terrific image as a leader,” says Roger Hartley, dean of the College of Public Affairs at the University of Baltimore. “He has taken decisive action and he has messaged in a way that is upfront and transparent,” Hartley said. Hartley said it has been to Hogan’s advantage politically that his response to the virus has been “better and different” than that of the federal government, which has been accused of sending mixed messages and not supplying necessary resources. The situation has revived speculation that Hogan could run for higher office once his second term is over in 2022. The governor has said he’s not interested in a run for the U.S. Senate, but would be open to considering a run for president in 2024. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ― the vice chairman of the National Governors Association who leads the state with the country’s largest city ― has been the most visible governor during the outbreak, but Hogan is catching some eyes. “The pandemic has put governors in the spotlight out of necessity, since Trump’s federal government was in denial and so slow off the mark,” Sabato said. But Sabato said he believed Republican moderates like Hogan don’t have much of a future in the GOP. “It’s too long to 2024 for useful speculation. But the GOP is not going to nominate a moderate like Hogan under any conditions,” he said. Hogan has avoided talking about politics during the crisis. He backed away from his policy clashes with the Democratic-controlled legislature. The governor says he’s been working around the clock. “I haven’t slept much,” Hogan says. “My adrenaline kicked in. My instincts kicked in. I went into overdrive." Sometimes, he stops for moment to think about how unthinkable this situation was not long ago. “We had to make what we thought was an unimaginable set of decisions,” Hogan says. “Who would have ever thought you would have to close all the schools in the state? Who would have thought you would have to close down private businesses? But we had to.”

Maryland to end temporary extra pay for state employees working during coronavirus outbreak
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration has halted pay increases for state employees working during the coronavirus outbreak, saying the state has “taken every reasonable and appropriate measure to protect employees and control the spread of this disease in our facilities.” In a letter to state employees, including corrections officers and hospital workers, the Department of Budget and Management wrote that the state will end premium pay for all essential and mission critical personnel Monday. According to AFSCME Maryland, the union which represents many of the affected state employees, the state had been paying some essential and mission critical employees double for hourly work since March 12. But state officials say the additional pay is no longer necessary as they believe agencies have implemented the proper procedures to protect employees from COVID-19 as well as control the spread of the disease inside state facilities. Cynthia Kollner, executive director of the department’s Office of Personnel Services and Benefits, wrote that “all agencies have provided our emergency responders and employees having direction interaction with the public appropriate levels of personal protective equipment and/or guidance about how to reduce to risk of exposure.” She added that state agencies were also directed on how to operate state facilities Friday morning. “As a result, we are now confident that we have taken every reasonable and appropriate measure to protect employees and control the spread of this disease in our facilities,” Kollner wrote. Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3, said the state has not met the standards to ensure state employees are not exposed to the virus and should reinstate the pay increases. He said certain state facilities have not implemented proper social distancing procedures, saying that inmates at prisons are still fed in large groups inside a dining hall. “We disagree with the governor’s characterization that all controls are in place in all state facilities,” Moran said. “The state has not done everything that it can in order to mitigate those circumstances.” Nicholas Pepersack, deputy chief of staff for state budget secretary David Brinkley, wrote in an email that the decision “is the natural evolution of the administration’s response to this public health emergency.” “It was never the administration’s intent to provide unlimited premium pay for the duration of the pandemic to all state employees who reported to their offices to work,” Pepersack wrote. “The premium pay incentive was meant to fairly compensate some of our hardest working employees in some of the most challenging positions within state government for reporting to work while the administration implemented every reasonable and appropriate measure at our disposal to protect our employees and control the spread of this disease in our facilities,” he continued. Angela Llewellyn, a nurse at the Thomas B. Finan Center, a psychiatric hospital in Allegany County, said she feels that staff are being exposed to the virus on a regular basis as a result of their occupation. Llewellyn said the end of premium pay could be a burden for some state employees whose significant others are being placed on leave or laid off as they’re being forced to stay home. “This is the worst possible time that he should be doing this,” Llewellyn said. Moran said he could not say when he thought it’d be an appropriate time for the state to look at ending premium pay. “Our members are doing a tough job under very difficult circumstances,” Moran said. “We don’t know when we’re going to hit the peak.” This article has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Allegany County.

CCPS expanding meal sites, adding some delivery as demand increases during coronavirus shutdown
.W
Carroll County Public Schools began providing free meal pickup to anyone under 18 the same day schools closed to in-person teaching, March 16. The initial seven sites have expanded to three more since then and Food Services has partnered with Transportation to begin delivering meals by bus, starting with Taneytown. Additional emergency feeding sites were added at Elmer Wolfe Elementary in Union Bridge followed by East Middle in Westminster and Spring Garden Elementary in Hampstead on Tuesday, April 14. The bus delivery routes also started Tuesday for areas more than one mile from the meal distribution site at Taneytown Elementary School. That area has the highest number of students who participate in the free and reduced price meals (FARM) program, said CCPS Food Services Supervisor Karen Sarno. A staff member from Food Services rides on each bus with the driver to distribute meals at bus stops along routes Transportation Services developed. Sarno said she hopes it will take hold once people have confidence that the bus will show up consistently. Going forward they’re working to expand to additional sites in Mount Airy and Eldersburg, but don’t have firm opening dates yet, Sarno said. Thursday, April 9, was the biggest distribution day for the program so far, as CCPS provided multiple days worth of meals to children to hold them over the holiday weekend while schools (and food distribution) were closed Friday and Monday. “We distributed 34,146 meals. Prior to that we were distributing somewhere between 4,000-6,200 meals per day,” Sarno said, noting that, starting Tuesday, they have been distributing between 7,000 and 8,000 meals per day, returning to the regular one-day meal distribution model after the long weekend. “It’s great,” Sarno said. “I think we’re meeting a need in our community.” She said the food services staff has been “incredible” coming in to work motivated and following safety precautions. “It’s still their kids that they see coming down the line,” she said. She addressed a rumor that some meal distribution sites may be in danger of closing because not enough families are using them, saying that is not the case. The distribution is funded through the USDA’s Summer Food Service Program. Despite its name, the program can also be deployed to provide meals in times when school is closed for emergencies, such as a tornado aftermath, or now in the coronavirus pandemic. While there is the possibility an emergency feeding site could close if it drew only very small numbers, that is not a concern in Carroll. “We don’t have any sites that are anywhere in danger of being shut down,” Sarno said. For some sites they have even purchased more equipment like a mobile refrigerator unit to hold cartons of milk. Some of the newer sites have been able to open after the USDA relaxed some requirements for where an emergency feeding site could be based on FARM and census data. The understanding is that the economic effects of the shutdown are also hitting families that don’t traditionally have those challenges, Sarno said. Food Services communicates with school administrators and Pupil Personnel Workers about areas that need services. Then it takes a little time t get that site set up with staff, food supply and training before it can open. “Overall people have been just very nice,” Sarno said. She hopes the meals can give kids “a little normalcy that’s missing in their day” and noted that some of the sweetest moments have been hearing kids get excited when their parents pass meals to them and they immediately want to look through and see what they’ve gotten that day. When people ask if they can donate to the meals program, she encourages them to donate to a local food pantry or other organizations. CCPS is part of a federal program with funding, and some other places don’t have as much guarantee. The meal program is also for those 18 and under, so local food pantries can help feed other members of a family.

At least 57 Baltimore County nursing homes report coronavirus outbreaks, 2nd drive-thru testing site to open, Olszewski says
.W
At least 57 of Baltimore County’s assisted living facilities have reported coronavirus outbreaks and they account for more than half of the county’s 58 coronavirus-related deaths, County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. said during a teleconference Wednesday. With Baltimore County surpassing more than 2,000 coronavirus cases as of Wednesday, Olszewski said the long-term care facilities are his biggest concern amid the pandemic. “There are many unlicensed facilities,” he added, “where we don’t know what’s going on.” Coronavirus outbreaks have been confirmed at Spring Grove Hospital Center in Catonsville, a psychiatric care facility, where the Maryland Department of Health said a dozen cases have been reported, and at an assisted living facility in Parkville, where the 21234 ZIP code counts 169 confirmed cases, the second-highest concentration in the county. Elyn Garrett-Jones, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore County Health Department, said the department was monitoring the nursing home outbreaks, but declined to say which county facilities where outbreaks were occurring. “Along with the state health department, we are closely monitoring outbreaks” and assessing infection control practices at long-term care facilities, Garrett-Jones wrote in an email. The county also is helping to provide personal protective equipment for nursing homes and is canvassing nursing registries to facilitate additional staff for facilities that may be experiencing staff shortages, she said. Baltimore County is preparing to open a second drive-thru testing facility along the Liberty Road corridor that runs through Randallstown, where the county is seeing its highest concentration of coronavirus cases in the 21133 ZIP code and where black residents make up 81% of the population. As of Wednesday, 173 residents have tested positive for coronavirus in the 21133 ZIP code. Garrett-Jones would not say exactly where the testing site will be located on Liberty Road or when it will open. Baltimore County opened its first drive-thru testing clinic last week at the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium. Black Marylanders have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, according to the state health department. In Baltimore County, 846 black residents who have tested positive for coronavirus outnumber the confirmed cases of white, Hispanic and Asian residents combined, according to data from the Maryland Department of Health available on Baltimore County’s COVID-19 dashboard. Noting the “disparities in traditionally underserved minority and vulnerable populations,” Olszewski said, “this is a chance for us to actually not only response to the COVID [pandemic], but think about some of the underlying issues.”

Maryland Senate approves $47.9 billion budget that includes $10 million to fight coronavirus
.W
Maryland senators voted unanimously Thursday to approve a $47.9 billion state budget that includes $10 million to fight the spread of coronavirus and restores funding to health, education and cultural programs cut in Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s spending plan. The Democratic-controlled Senate voted 47-0 to approve the budget with bipartisan support. Sen. Guy Guzzone, a Howard County Democrat who is chairman of the Senate’s Budget and Taxation Committee, said the amended budget continues to ramp up funding for a sweeping overhaul of public schools proposed by the state’s Kirwan Commission. “It’s a very responsible budget,” Guzzone said. “We’re planning for the future. We’re planning for what we’re going to do with Kirwan. We’re planning for the troubles we see nationally and internationally with coronavirus. We’re trying to be as responsible as we can in putting money aside.” The budget contains $10 million proposed by Hogan to help with the state’s response to the spread of coronavirus in Maryland, where 12 cases have been confirmed. That’s money on top of the up to $50 million the legislature already authorized the governor to draw from the so-called rainy day fund. “He’s got $60 million to deal with issues the state may confront,” Guzzone said of Hogan. The Senate made a number of changes to Hogan’s budget, including restoring some spending reductions proposed by the governor. Senators restored $39.5 million for developmental disabilities, behavioral health and Medicaid providers; $18.2 million for community colleges; $11.1 million for independent colleges; $1.6 million for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra; and $200,000 for Maryland Public Television. Guzzone said the funding for the orchestra would help the BSO get back on its feet after financial struggles. “We made the commitment to the BSO,” Guzzone said. “The idea is the BSO can succeed and over time have much less reliance on the state.” The budget also includes a 2% raise for state workers and a 5% raise for state law enforcement officers. The Senate’s spending plan is slightly smaller than the one proposed by Hogan. Senators freed up money by making dozens of small cuts through the budget, including a $7.1 million reduction to business tax credits and eliminating long-vacant positions throughout state government, such as a $10.5 million cut in the transportation department and a $2.5 million cut in the prison system. Hogan proposed a budget in January that included $355 million to pay for additional public school programs that have been recommended by the state’s Kirwan Commission ― an amount increased to $362 million under the Senate spending plan. Lawmakers in the House of Delegates have already passed the Kirwan Commission’s legislation to overhaul the state’s public schools ― at an eventual cost of $3.8 billion annually ― through expanded prekindergarten, improved career and college prep programs, additional community schools, more support for high-poverty schools and increased teacher salaries. The bill now awaits approval in the state Senate. Both chambers are now considering different versions of tax packages that could raise about $700 million annually to help pay for the education overhaul. That’s not enough to fully fund all 10 years of the commission’s plans, but would pay for more than half. Among the revenue-raising proposals under consideration: New taxes on digital advertising and digital downloads of things like music, books and movies; and increasing the tobacco tax. Guzzone said the Senate was not taking up a House proposal to expand the sales tax to certain so-called luxury services, such as fur cleaning, marina services and country club memberships. The House gave final approval Thursday to four of the tax bills aimed at generating money for Kirwan. The bill applying the sales tax to luxury services is still pending in the House, which is scheduled to take it up during an evening session on Thursday. “We want to make sure we have the next five years [of Kirwan] fully ramped up and ready,” Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat said. Though the state’s budget must be balanced each year, legislative budget analysts say they’re concerned about the size of the state’s structural deficit in future years, forecasting a $701 million shortfall by fiscal year 2022 and $1.1 billion by fiscal year 2025. Sen. Andrew A. Serafini, a Washington County Republican, called the budget a “great bill” that included “tough decisions," but he said he’d like to see more money dedicated to the rainy day fund. Likewise, Hogan’s budget secretary, David Brinkley, called on lawmakers to restore any reductions to the rainy day fund in light of the spread of coronavirus. “Given the inevitability that this situation is escalating, we urge the legislature to preserve as much money in the rainy day fund as possible,” Brinkley said. The Senate’s version of the budget reduces an appropriation to the so-called rainy day fund by $284 million, but includes $1.2 billion in the rainy day fund and $129 million in cash reserves in the general fund. “We’re being mindful of the economic situation at the moment and we’re prepared,” Ferguson said. The budget now advances to the House for consideration. Baltimore Sun reporter Pamela Wood contributed to this article.

Havre de Grace postpones work sessions on 2021 budget because of coronavirus restrictions on gatherings
.W
Two Havre de Grace City Council work sessions on the city’s proposed fiscal 2021 budget, scheduled for March 30 and April 13, have been postponed to later in the spring because of state restrictions on the size of public gatherings, meant to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. City officials, who have already taken significant steps to curtail municipal meetings, events and activities as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, planned to broadcast the work sessions online via livestream rather than open the council chambers to the public. They realized this week that state regulations, which limit public gatherings to 10 people maximum, meant even a livestreamed session would not be possible with six council members, the mayor, city department heads and a Harford Cable Network crew in the room. “We really wouldn’t have any room for the directors to answer questions” from the council if all six department heads could not be present at the same time, Mayor William T. Martin noted Tuesday. Martin and other city leaders decided Tuesday morning to postpone the work sessions to “a date to be determine,” possibly late April or early May. There is enough “discretionary time” between now and when the formal budget ordinance is introduced during the first council meeting in June, the mayor said. The typical schedule for approving the budget includes the introduction to council the first Monday in June, a public hearing the second Monday and a vote to adopt the third Monday, according to Martin. The current fiscal year ends June 30 and the next begins July 1. Martin said he hopes Gov. Larry Hogan will lift his order limiting gatherings to 10 people by April or May. “Then, we’ll have a budget work session that will be a lot more productive with more people in the room,” he said. The mayor submitted a nearly $35 million combined budget to the City Council during its March 16 meeting. It includes a $20.3 million general fund, $13.9 million water and sewer fund and $659,300 marine facilities fund. People can review the full proposed budget on the city website, and they can submit their comments via email to City Council members or the directors of administration and finance, call City Hall at 410-939-1800 and leave a message, or even leave a note with their contact information in a drop box outside City Hall — the municipal building is open for business, but members of the public cannot conduct business with city staff face to face. People should conduct business such as applying for permits or paying taxes and utility bills online or by phone. City Council President David Glenn encouraged people to leave messages for him or other council members if they want to discuss the budget, and he will get back with them. “I have an open-door policy,” Glenn said Tuesday. Budget details “I have increased spending on city infrastructure significantly, as mandated by citizens in the most recent special election,” Martin said as he introduced the preliminary budget, referring to the special city election on Feb. 4 when voters approved borrowing up to $15 million in bond funding to fix aging water and sewer infrastructure. “Spending within the general fund is increased, as well, compared to prior years,” said Martin, who noted much of that additional spending will go to toward shoreline preservation projects supported by grants from Harford County and the state. The proposed general fund budget of $20.34 million is nearly $5 million higher than the $15.37 million fund adopted for the current fiscal year, according to budget documents. A surplus of $609,600 is expected to be available when the next fiscal year starts. Officials also anticipate $3.35 million in county and state grants to support infrastructure projects such as redeveloping the Susquehanna River shoreline on property along Water Street that the city acquired from the county several years ago. There is “a lot of good money coming our way to try to make Havre de Grace better,” Glenn said. “We’ve just got to get through this virus and get back to normal,” the council president added. “You just have to do the right thing for the right reasons and let common sense be your guide.” Other infrastructure projects include stormwater remediation to help improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay, according to Martin’s introductory letter. The mayor also plans to spend nearly $5.2 million on capital projects in the water and sewer fund, such as $1.3 million worth of sewer line improvements along Commerce Street and $781,900 to upgrade water lines, according to budget documents. The mayor plans to keep property tax rates, as well as water and sewer rates, the same next year. Revenue figures could change, as the city works through the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year amid a massive national economic slowdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. Community events large and small have been canceled, businesses have closed temporarily or sharply reduced service, schools are closed and many people are staying home to avoid catching the virus. “The city does have a good cash flow on hand at the moment,” said Martin, who noted that officials expect some "slowdown in revenue before it picks back up.” Martin has asked city staff to refrain from making any purchases the rest of the fiscal year “unless absolutely necessary.” Havre de Grace also has about $1.6 million in its emergency fund and a little more than $600,000 in its fund balance, or cash reserves, that can be used if needed. “We’re definitely taking a proactive approach to reserving our funds on hand, for whatever might happen,” he said.

Maryland received some faulty ventilators ahead of coronavirus surge, U.S. senator says
.W
In the scramble to locate more ventilators for critically ill coronavirus patients, Maryland received some that did not work, according to Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who has been pushing federal authorities for proper supplies. Maryland officials have been working to buy ventilators, as well as acquire them from the national stockpile, ahead of an expected surge in COVID-19 cases. It’s not clear how many ventilators had problems or what was wrong, or even where they came from. Officials from the administration of Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, say only one ventilator so far has been found in disrepair. A state representative, however, issued an urgent call last week for technicians to fix a supply of ventilators that were nonfunctional. Newly released documents show that ventilators were among supplies Maryland requested from the federal authorities, but the state received only 138 of 200 ventilators on its wish list. The state also received only a small fraction of other supplies it requested, including masks, gloves, face shields and body bags. Cardin tied the ventilators to the larger problem of inadequate medical supplies and protective gear during a Friday conference with federal health officials, said Tim Zink, spokesman for Cardin. “Sen. Cardin is aware of and troubled by the fact that several of the ventilators recently delivered to Maryland from the federal emergency reserves were nonfunctioning,” he said. “Sen. Cardin considers it patently unacceptable that states are not receiving the resources they need to protect front-line health care workers and help them save lives. He will continue to pressure federal agencies responsible for such shortfalls until Maryland’s needs are met.” Zink said Monday that the senator believed the regional representatives from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were now working aggressively on “supply chain issues” to better distribute needed equipment. The shortfalls around the country have alarmed some state leaders, with reports of health providers going without protective equipment and now patients potentially going without ventilators. Companies and individuals have responded by making what supplies they can and donating them. Maryland has joined other states in developing plans for rationing ventilators if needed. Ventilators are of particular importance as they supply life-saving oxygen to those most critically ill from the respiratory disease known as COVID-19. State health officials say Maryland now has 1,250 ventilators available and they are searching for others, including those that may be housed in medical and nursing schools and other health care-related teaching facilities, as well as elective surgery centers. The state could need more than 1,800 at one time when cases peak, potentially in late April, according to an estimate by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Already, a large number of Maryland’s ICU beds already are going to COVID-19 patients, according to state officials. They said Friday that there are about 180 coronavirus patients in intensive care, representing almost half the ICU beds identified last week as available in the state’s four dozen hospitals. Officials did not say how many required ventilators. Other states also have been seeking ventilators from federal stockpiles and on the open market. Bloom Energy, the company California hired to service its machines, reports on its website that it is now also working on ventilators from Delaware. A New York Times story recently detailed that a dispute among contractors led to a lapse in the contract to provide upkeep for the machines in the national stockpile. A spokesperson from Health and Human Services said officials there were not aware of issues with ventilators provided to Maryland and that equipment was maintained based on manufacturer’s specifications. “For jurisdictions that may have experienced challenges with external battery packs, they were provided with additional technical assistance ... on how to charge the batteries and the manufacturer’s recommendation to use AC as the primary power source for these machines,” the statement said. Mike Ricci, a Hogan spokesman, said he was aware of only one faulty ventilator that the state Department of Health purchased with federal grant money and previously distributed into the system. It had a malfunctioning battery and the state swapped it out, he said. It was not from the federal stockpile, he said. A spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health, Charles Gischlar, said the agency is checking all of the ventilators it received “to make sure there are no other issues.” An official with a Baltimore-area company, OEM Medical Solutions LLC, said it had responded to an urgent state appeal for expert technicians to fix ventilators and had spoken Friday with state emergency management officials. The job would be a priority if the firm was asked because it wants to do what it can to help, said Michael Milan, a spokesman for OEM Medical and vice president of the Baltimore Medical Engineers & Technicians Society. He compared the work to automotive repairs. “Without going over the systems thoroughly, we could not speculate what it would take to get the machines functional, nor how long it would take, especially if there is a high demand for parts,” Milan said. “We have qualified technicians on staff, as well as a pool of trusted independent contractors should we need to scale up for such a project.” Baltimore Sun reporter Pamela Wood contributed to this article.

Maryland universities suspend Italy programs as CDC raises coronavirus warning level
.W
The University of Maryland and Towson University have suspended study abroad programs in Italy and told students to return home after the CDC raised its coronavirus warning level Friday night to limit travel in that country. The university’s flagship College Park campus has 136 students studying in Italy, while Towson has nine students and additional faculty and staff there. Both universities notified their campuses after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance for Italy telling people to avoid nonessential travel because of widespread community transmission of the illness. “This evening the CDC moved Italy from Alert Level 2 to Warning Level 3,” Mary Ann Rankin, senior vice president and provost at the University of Maryland, said in a campuswide email Friday night. “In light of this change, the university is hereby suspending Education Abroad programs in Italy for spring 2020.” Students from the University of Maryland are expected to leave Italy as soon as possible to return to the U.S. "Towson University is recalling all faculty, staff, and students who are currently abroad in Italy,” Towson said on its website, adding that it relied on information and recommendations from the U.S. State Department and the CDC, and consulted with its international partners. The latest warning from the CDC raises the travel advisory level for Italy from level two, in which it advised taking precautions such as washing hands frequently and staying home if a person is sick. The new warning, the highest level of alert, goes further and warns of community transmission, or the spread of the illness to people who did not travel or knowingly come in contact with someone infected. The U.S. announced Saturday it is elevating travel warnings to regions of Italy and South Korea, as well as banning travel to Iran. No cases of coronavirus have been confirmed at either university or in Maryland, where three people as of Saturday morning are being tested for the virus that has sickened more than 80,000 people globally. Two other people were tested in Maryland but were found to not have the virus. Also on Saturday, health officials in Washington state announced a person has died of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the first such reported death in the U.S. Students in the University of Maryland’s Italy programs are being told to return to the U.S., return to their homes away from the campus, follow CDC guidelines to self-quarantine for 14 days and seek medical help as needed. The university’s Education Abroad office is offering possible online study options. “We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation world-wide, and will take further action if warranted,” Rankin said in the email. Likewise, Towson’s study abroad students, as well as faculty and staff returning from Italy, will not go back to campus, and “instead will self-quarantine, in an abundance of caution,” the university website’s announcement says. “All TU Study Abroad students will be fully supported by the Office of the Provost to ensure the completion of their coursework of study.” On Wednesday, Towson had suspended all upcoming university-sponsored travel to Italy. Other Maryland colleges and universities that have study abroad programs in Italy, according to their websites, include Salisbury University, St. Mary’s College of Maryland, Frostburg State University, Loyola University Maryland, Washington College, Stevenson University, St. John’s College, Mount St. Mary’s University, Maryland Institute College of Art and University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Dinah Winnick, UMBC director of communications, said Saturday that all spring programs in countries that have a CDC Warning Level 3 are suspended. The university is in communication with one UMBC student who is studying in Italy through a third-party program about leaving the country. A spring break trip to Italy has also been canceled, she said. McDaniel College does not currently have any students studying abroad in Italy, said Cheryl Knauer, director of public relations. The college is monitoring the global situation and is in touch with students currently studying at McDaniel Europe in Budapest, Hungary, as well as other locations, she said. University of Maryland students in the study abroad program in Japan, currently on alert level two, also need to be “prepared to return to the U.S. should the alert level for that country increase to Warning Level 3,” Rankin said. Towson had suspended upcoming travel to Japan, but said it will not at this point recall faculty, staff or students currently in Japan. Students who are abroad also are being urged to limit additional travel as much as possible. In making study abroad program decisions, Rankin said, the university is relying on information from the CDC, the World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department, state and local health departments, and on-campus public health experts. On Thursday, the University of Maryland suspended its foreign study abroad programs in South Korea and told students to return home. The CDC raised its alert level from two to three in South Korea, saying that there is transmission within the country and that anyone there on nonessential travel should leave. The spring program in South Korea was set to begin for eight students on March 15. Six students were already in South Korea and two are still in the U.S. Both University of Maryland and Towson had already cancelled study abroad programs in China for the spring. Towson said it has not yet made decisions regarding travel during spring break, summer or fall. “Towson University will continually evaluate this rapidly evolving situation based on the recommendations of both host country and U.S. public health authorities and will take alternative action as appropriate,” the university posted on its website.

‘Not really a playbook for this’: Harford’s golf courses are open despite coronavirus concerns
.W
While schools, restaurants and many other parts of everyday life are closed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, Harford County’s golf courses remain open for business. All seven 18-hole courses, five public and two private, are taking precautions, but are open. At Mountain Branch Golf Club in Joppa, play is definitely up and has been due to the mild winter. The course is open with no out of ordinary restrictions, but suggestions and more than routine cleaning are in place. That goes for all the courses. Club pro, Matt Summers, says that golf events scheduled for Mountain Branch as early as late April have not yet been affected. “That being said, we are waiting on mandates and guidelines," Summers said. “There’s not really a playbook for this.” Summers says the suggestions in the carts are for players to limit touching some parts used in a round of golf such as flag sticks. Ruggles Golf Course in Aberdeen, the military owned course, is clearly under the government guidelines. Currently open, no tee times are being taken due to not knowing when and if the course is told to close. Also in Aberdeen, Wetlands Golf Course is open with no restrictions. The grille is still open, but for carry-out only. Bulle Rock Golf Course, which was recently sold, is open as well with no added restrictions. Buffets, banquets and dinners have been canceled, per Mike Corriggio, golf shop manager at Bulle Rock. “No changes to golf outings at this point,” Corriggio said. To the north in Street, Geneva Farm Golf Course is open for play, where course superintendent Jim Walls says they are short staffed because of the situation we are experiencing. Like the other courses, carts are being sanitized at Geneva Farm. Currently nothing has been postponed or canceled, but there are events on the horizon. “Three large outings that we’re worried about,” Walls said. Those events are scheduled for late April and early May. “We’re taking as many precautions as we can,” Walls added. Maryland Golf and Country Clubs and Winters Run Golf Club, both private courses in Bel Air, are open to members and both have released statements to members. Just across the Susquehanna River in Perryville, Furnace Bay Golf Course is open, too, under direction of owner Shelby Haley. The course snack bar is closed and will not open until we get past the curve, noted Haley, and the course will be closed Monday and Tuesday for aeration, she said.

Baltimore activist DeRay Mckesson confirms that he tested positive for coronavirus
.W
Baltimore activist DeRay Mckesson confirmed via Twitter that he tested positive for the new coronavirus. “I lost my sense of taste about a week ago — a mild symptom, the doctor said,” he wrote in a Twitter thread Thursday night. “Quarantine has now turned into isolation. Luckily, taste is beginning to come back. The doc expects me to recover fully, told me to call if I have any chest pains.” Mckesson also pointed people towards a COVID-19 resource portal at whileathome.org. Mckesson, when reached by phone Friday morning, said that he got tested in New York, where he’s currently in quarantine. He said he didn’t know when he would be back in Baltimore, but estimated that his sense of taste is now 70 percent back. He added that his doctor said that the loss of taste is a later symptom of the coronavirus and that he suspects he’s on the mend. Mckesson additionally tweeted Thursday night about the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on black communities, which is also reflected in Maryland state data. He attributed this to structural racism. Speaking over the phone, Mckesson pointed to his work on a program with the K Health app that offers residents of Louisiana (a state where the pandemic has hit especially hard) free access to virtual primary care doctors through April. “That initiative that we helped launch in Louisiana is something that we wish we had at home, in Baltimore,” Mckesson said. “I wish that everybody who thought they had a symptom or thought they didn’t feel well could just talk to a doctor.” He said that he’d “love to help facilitate that at home" and noted that systemic boundaries stop many people in marginalized communities from going to doctors unless they’re really sick.

Federal judge orders the release of Baltimore man awaiting trial amid coronavirus outbreak 
.W
A federal judge on Wednesday granted the emergency release of a 50-year-old Baltimore man who was arrested last month on gun and drug charges, according to court documents. Derrick Boone first appeared in court on March 12, and a detention hearing was held four days later. At the hearing his lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial because of a preexisting medical condition that put him at risk for contracting COVID-19, the deadly disease caused by the new coronavirus. Boone suffers from asthma and high blood pressure, court documents say. A federal judge denied his request at the time, agreeing with prosecutors that he “poses a risk to the safety of other persons in the community.” The court did invite Boone to file a motion for reconsideration. At the time, there were no reported positive cases of COVID-19 in the state’s jails and prisons, court documents say. But on Wednesday prosecutors and defense attorneys reached an agreement to release him to the custody of his mother, with conditions sharply curtailing his movement. He also must check in regularly with court officials. The joint motion to release him relied heavily on the growing number of reported cases of COVID-19 among inmates and staff throughout the Baltimore prison system. Boone was being held at the Metropolitan Transition Center, which since his last court appearance has reported several positive cases of COVID-19. In light of the outbreaks in other Maryland prisons, along with the transition center being placed on full quarantine after a corrections officer there tested positive, Assistant United States Attorney Brandon Moore and Assistant Federal Public Defender Maggie Grace came to an agreement on Boone’s release. The court motions cited several stories from The Baltimore Sun detailing the deteriorating conditions in Maryland prisons and the rapidly growing cases of infected inmates, correctional officers and contractual staff. The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services has reported 93 cases of coronavirus — 77 of those cases were found inside of Maryland prison facilities directly — a significant jump from 57 total cases just a week before. One inmate in his 60s has died, according to the department. The court ordered Boone to “comply with all directives from federal, state, and local government pertaining to public health, including COVID-19.” Boone was indicted on eight charges last month stemming from a Dec. 19, 2019, incident, including possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking, possession with intent to distribute, conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, and possession of firearm by a prohibited person, according to court documents. Other Baltimore inmates have since voiced their complaints about the unclean prison facility conditions, including Travis Gary and John Waters III, two inmates located in the Baltimore City Correctional Center, directly across from the Metropolitan Transition Center. In other court changes, late Tuesday afternoon, Maryland Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera ordered trial courts to identify and release prisoners statewide who are at-risk for the coronavirus and pose no threat to public safety. Barbera’s order opens the door for state prisoners to be released on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the closing of courts has been extended through June 5. Close to a month ago, Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced she would stop prosecuting anyone arrested for possessing drugs including heroin, attempted distribution of any drug, prostitution, trespassing, minor traffic offenses, open container and urinating in public.

Howard County receives AAA bond rating for 23rd year amid coronavirus economic uncertainty 
.W
Howard County has received a AAA bond rating from all three of the nation’s credit-rating agencies, County Executive Calvin Ball announced Thursday. This is the 23rd year Howard County received the highest possible credit rating, which will allow the county to maintain low interest rates when repaying bonds. “We are living through challenging times and the impact, response and recovery from coronavirus is going to affect everyone financially — including the Howard County government,” Ball said in a statement. “Achieving our AAA bond rating means that our residents will be saving money due to the careful fiscal stewardship of our county’s leaders over the past 23 years.” Howard County is one of 46 counties to receive the AAA rating from all three bond rating agencies: Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investor Services and Standard & Poor’s, who came to Howard County this year to meet with county officials. On Wednesday, Ball released his proposed capital budget; of the $250.4 million proposed for fiscal 2021, $94.6 million would come from general obligation bonds. “This AAA rating evidences Howard County’s strong fiscal foundation and its ability to weather uncertain economic times,” County Council Chairwoman Deb Jung said in a statement. In Moody’s Investor Services rating report, the agency said they consider the coronavirus outbreak a social risk given the public health and safety implications, but they do not see “immediate credit risks” for Howard County, according to a county news release. However, the situation surrounding coronavirus is “rapidly evolving” and the longer-term economic impact of the virus will depend on “both the severity and duration of the crisis,” according to the Moody’s report. “If our view of the credit quality of Howard County changes, we will update the rating and/or outlook at that time.”

Amid coronavirus concerns, malls in Harford, Baltimore counties remain open for now
.W
Shopping malls in Harford and Baltimore counties continue to be open amid concerns surrounding the novel coronavirus, while noting that individual retailers may adopt their own policies on store closures. Howard County Executive Calvin Ball ordered The Mall in Columbia be closed for seven days starting Monday after the first cases of COVID-19 were found in Howard. While no other malls have closed as of mid-day Tuesday, many have canceled scheduled events, ramped up cleaning efforts and adjusted hours. Events at Harford Mall in Bel Air, including its Easter photo program, have been canceled or postponed and there is an increased frequency of cleaning and sanitizing all high traffic common areas and "touchpoints." "The health and well-being of our customers, employees, retail partners, and our communities is always a top priority," according to a statement posted on the Harford Mall's website. “We are closely monitoring updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have been in contact with the local health department, and are maintaining open lines of communication as this situation evolves.” Malls in Baltimore County are adopting a similar approach regarding cancelling events and the increasing the frequency of cleaning. Some, like White Marsh Mall and Towson Town Center, both owned by Brookfield Properties Retail Group, have modified hours. White Marsh is now open noon to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. Towson will open at noon each day, closing at 7 p.m. every day except Sunday, when it will close at 6 p.m. Both White Marsh and Towson said all of its restaurant, bar and food court tenants were expected to comply with the governor’s order that they cease on-premise food and beverage consumption. While food court tenants may continue to operate for carryout and delivery service, seating in the food court at both shopping malls would not be permitted, according to the malls’ websites. The Easter Bunny experience at White Marsh has also been postponed. If the situation changes, it may open closer to the holiday, according to the mall's website. If not, refunds will be issued for reservations. Both malls’ websites, as well as Harford Mall’s site, note that hours at individual retailers and restaurants may vary, so customers should call ahead of time or check the online store directories. Eastpoint Mall in Dundalk said on its Facebook page that it has ordered additional automated hand sanitizer dispensers to be put inside the mall’s entrances. It also canceled its March bingo scheduled for Tuesday and its Easter Egg hunt on March 28. This article may be updated.

We should all keep journals detailing how we handled the coronavirus outbreak | COMMENTARY
.W
This morning I am thinking that we should all be keeping a journal as we traverse this coronavirus pandemic (“Coronavirus plea from Johns Hopkins: please take social distancing seriously to save lives,” March 24). Let’s look at not only our challenges but moments of gratitude. Whether having time for reconnecting with family or treasuring the beauty of nature, it could be a time of individual growth. Looking back, we will have a record of a time when each of us survived and ultimately flourished. Our stories will all be different, but our focus on healing physically and spiritually will be the lesson that will make us stronger, more compassionate, more courageous and better human beings.

Sports cancellations and the coronavirus: Summer Olympics moved to 2021, DeCosta talks trade
.W
Here are the latest cancellations, postponements and alterations in sporting events around the Baltimore area and nationally. Scroll to down to see national sporting event cancellations. Local Major League Lacrosse Major League Lacrosse elected to suspend the start of the 2020 season, originally scheduled for May 30. This decision was made on April 3 to safeguard the health of our players, fans and staff, as well as those within our MLL communities as a result of the global pandemic. MIAA/IAAM The leagues are currently following the same mandate as the MPSSAA with the suspension of the season now extended to April 27. Summer Olympics It was announced that the summer Olympics in Tokyo have been postponed until 2021. Ravens GM Eric DeCosta on trading away Hayden Hurst, dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and more In his first public comments since the NFL’s new league year started Wednesday, DeCosta explained the mechanics behind last week’s lnotable trades. Maryland Gov. Hogan shuts down casinos, racetracks and off-track betting to limit coronavirus spread Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is shutting down the state’s casinos, racetracks and off-track betting parlors indefinitely in an attempt to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. Amid coronavirus outbreak, Ravens officials halt air travel, move to remote work As concerns about the coronavirus pandemic grip the sports world, the Ravens announced Friday that they were immediately suspending business air travel and requiring “virtually all team personnel” to work remotely for at least two weeks. MIAA suspends spring season due to coronavirus pandemic, hopes for return The Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association, which had already begun its spring season with games continuing as late as Thursday, has halted play following the directives from the Governor’s Office and the State Department of Education in regards to the coronavirus pandemic. Orioles’ prep cut off as MLB cancels spring training games, delays start of season amid coronavirus pandemic The Orioles’ spring training preparations will be cut short as Major League Baseball canceled spring training games, effective at 4 p.m. Thursday, and is delaying the start of the regular season for at least two weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a league announcement. “MLB and the clubs have been preparing a variety of contingency plans regarding the 2020 regular season schedule,” the league said in a statement. “MLB will announce the effects on the schedule at an appropriate time, and will remain flexible as events warrant, with the hope of resuming normal operations as soon as possible. “Nothing is more important to us than the healthy and safety of our players, employees, and fans.” As Maryland horse racing tracks close to public, officials monitoring coronavirus impact on Triple Crown races The Maryland Jockey Club on Thursday announced the closures of its raceways at Pimlico Race Course, Laurel Park and Rosecroft Raceway to the public effective immediately, following state officials’ orders to cancel or postpone large public gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Jockey Club, which oversees the race tracks on behalf of The Stronach Group, the Canadian owners, said in the Thursday news release that live racing events at Laurel Park and Rosecroft Raceway will continue as scheduled but with limited personnel licensed by the Maryland Racing Commission in attendance. The bigger looming issue is the status of the 145th Preakness, scheduled to be run May 16. With crowds exceeding 130,000, the race is the most attended annual sporting event in Maryland, and it generates revenues that support the state’s racing industry for the rest of the year. A Jockey Club spokesman said track officials are taking a wait-and-see approach with their signature event but added that the Stronach Group has created a task force to monitor the spread of the virus and stay in regular contact with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Major Arena Soccer League halts season because of coronavirus pandemic; Blast left ‘completely sad’ The Major Arena Soccer League decided Thursday to end the regular season, effectively immediately, because of the coronavirus pandemic. The league’s Board of Directors voted unanimously Thursday “to act in the best interests of the players, staff and fans of the league,” the MASL said in a statement. Play halts with the Blast, who play their home games at Towson University’s SECU Arena, having won five of their past six games. A 9-5 win over the rival Harrisburg Heat on Saturday put them at 15-8 on the season. “We were kind of expecting something to happen because we’ve been watching the news and everything else was getting postponed or canceled. It’s very sad,” Blast star goalie William Vanzela said. National The Masters has been postponed because of the coronavirus Augusta National decided Monday to postpone the Masters because of the spread of the coronavirus. Club chairman Fred Ridley says he hopes postponing the event puts Augusta National in the best position to host the Masters and its other two events at some later date. NCAA cancels basketball championships The NCAA canceled the men’s and women’s basketball championships due to the coronavirus pandemic. The annual March Madness event was scheduled to tip off with First Four games Tuesday and Wednesday in Dayton, Ohio, and run through the Final Four in Atlanta on April 4 and 6. The Big Ten, Big 12, Big East and the SEC tournaments announced they were off, and other conferences were expected to follow suit. As several other big conferences around the country canceled their postseason tournaments, the Big East resumed on schedule at New York’s Madison Square Garden. It started its second-round game between top-seeded Creighton and St. John’s at Madison Square Garden and not until halftime was the tournament called off with St. John’s leading 38-35. On Thursday afternoon, the NCAA canceled all remaining winter and spring championships. The Power 5 conferences — the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Southeastern Conference, the Pac-12 Conference, the Big 12 Conference and the Big Ten Conference — announced one-by-one that they would be suspending their spring sports competitions. The NCAA men’s basketball tournament has been played every year since 1939 when Oregon won the championship in Evanston, Illinois. It has grown through the years, both in size and stature. The three-week tournament generates almost a billion dollars in revenue each year for the NCAA and its hundreds of member universities and colleges, most coming from a television contract with CBS and Turner that pays the NCAA almost $800 million annually. It is now one of the biggest events in American sports, a basketball marathon of buzzer-beaters, upset and thrills involving 68 teams. The field for the men’s tournament was scheduled to be announced Sunday, creating the famous bracket that sports fans would obsess over in office pools and at sportsbooks. NHL pausing play The NHL is following the NBA’s lead and suspending its season. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the pause of the season amid concerns about the new coronavirus. The NBA announced Wednesday night it was suspending play, after a player tested positive for COVID-19. Several NBA and NHL teams share arenas. The NHL has not said any player has tested positive for COVID-19. The league is halting play with 189 games left in the regular season, sparking uncertainty about how many more, if any, could be played before the playoffs. Bettman said the NHL has tried to follow mandates of health experts and local authorities without taking premature or unnecessary measures." Bettman’s statement said the NBA’s news made it “no longer appropriate to try to continue to play games at this time.” PGA Tour to carry on without spectators for the next month The PGA Tour plans to keep playing, just without anyone watching from outside the ropes. Commissioner Jay Monahan said that fans will not be allowed at the final three days of The Players Championship or three other tournaments — one in Florida, two in Texas — leading up to the Masters. Even as other leagues were canceling tournaments and events for a month or more, Monahan leaned on golf not being a contact sport and being played outdoors across sprawling acreage as a reason not to shut down entirely. “Our players are making their way over 400 acres,” Monahan said. “Because of the nature of that ... and over the course of a round our players generally do socially distance themselves, we felt like by taking this step to address the problem with our fans, we're in a position where we can continue to operate the events as of right now. “We’re comfortable having our players continue to play at this time.” MLS shutting down Major League Soccer is shutting down for 30 days because of the coronavirus. “Our clubs were united today in the decision to temporarily suspend our season — based on the advice and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Agency of Canada and other public health authorities," MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement Thursday. US Soccer cancels men’s and women’s national team matches The U.S. Soccer Federation canceled exhibitions in March and April for its men’s and women’s national teams but says for now the under-23 men’s team will remain in Mexico for Olympic qualifying. The men had been scheduled to play the Netherlands in Eindhoven on March 26 and Wales four days later in Cardiff, preparation for the scheduled start of World Cup qualifying in September. The women had been slated to face Australia at Sandy, Utah, on April 10 and Brazil four days later at San Jose, California, as they get ready for the Olympics this summer. The under-23 men's team is in Guadalajara for the Olympic qualifying tournament of North and Central America and the Caribbean. The U.S. is to meet Haiti in an exhibition on March 13, then plays Costa Rica on March 20, the Dominican Republic three days later and Mexico on March 26. The top two teams in each group advance to the semifinals on March 30. The semifinal winners represent CONCACAF at the16-nation men's Olympic tournament. The next scheduled match for the men’s national team is against Honduras in Houston on June 4 in the semifinals of the CONCACAF Nations League. Real Madrid teams put in quarantine Real Madrid’s soccer and basketball teams were put in quarantine one after one of the club’s basketball players tested positive for the coronavirus. The Spanish club said that its soccer team was affected because it shares training facilities with the basketball team. The decision by the club came moments before the Spanish league said the next two rounds of the top two soccer divisions will be suspended because of outbreak. The league said in a statement that it had taken the decision after becoming aware of “the quarantine established in Real Madrid and the possible cases in players from other clubs,” without mentioning those suspected cases. No player from a Spanish soccer team has been reported to have the virus. Italian club Juventus said Wednesday that defender Daniele Rugani and “those who have had contact with him” are being isolated after he tested positive for the virus. Olympic flame lit in Athens, Greece The flame for the Tokyo Olympics was lit at the birthplace of the ancient games in a pared-down ceremony because of the coronavirus. Standing in front of the ruined Temple of Hera in Ancient Olympia, a Greek actress playing the part of a pagan priestess used a concave mirror to focus the sun's rays on a silver torch, causing fire to spurt forth. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach noted the “difficult circumstances” created by the virus outbreak, but stressed the IOC’s commitment to the success of the Tokyo Games. “Nineteen weeks before the opening ceremony, we are strengthened in this commitment by the many authorities and sports organisations around the world which are taking so many significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus,” Bach said. The IOC has stressed that the July 24-Aug. 9 games will go ahead as planned — even as sports events in various countries are being curtailed or held without spectators — and urged all athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympics. But fears of the coronavirus forced Greek officials to ban members of the public from attending the ceremony and severely curtail the number of invited officials and journalists. Normally, several thousand people from many countries gather on the earthen banks of Olympia’s ancient stadium to watch the ceremony. President Donald Trump’s suggestion to postpone the Olympics for a year was immediately shot down by Japan’s Olympic minister. “The IOC and the organizing committee are not considering cancellation or a postponement — absolutely not at all,” Seiko Hashimoto, an Olympic bronze medalist, told a news conference on Friday in Tokyo. NBA suspending its season after player test positive for coronavirus The NBA has suspended its season “until further notice" after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus, a move that came only hours after the majority of the league’s owners were leaning toward playing games without fans in arenas. Now there will be no games at all, at least for the time being. A person with knowledge of the situation said the Jazz player who tested positive was center Rudy Gobert. “The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight’s schedule of games until further notice,” the league said in a statement sent shortly after 8:30 p.m. CT. “The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.” The test result, the NBA said, was reported shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for warmups and tip-off was moments away when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed “due to unforeseen circumstances." “It's a very serious time right now," Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I think the league moved appropriately and prudently and we'll all just have to monitor the situation and see where it goes from here." The Jazz released a statement saying a player — they did not identify Gobert — tested negative earlier Wednesday for flu, strep throat and an upper respiratory infection. That player’s symptoms diminished as the day went along, but the decision was made to test for COVID-19 anyway. That test came back with a preliminary positive result. “The individual is currently in the care of health officials in Oklahoma City," the Jazz said, adding that updates would come as appropriate. It has been a worldwide issue for several weeks. And now, it has hit the NBA. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he was stunned when the news came down, adding that “this is much bigger than basketball." “This is a global pandemic where people’s lives are at stake," Cuban said. “I’m a lot more worried about my kids, and my mom is 82 years old, and talking to her, and telling her to stay in the house, than I am about when we play our next game." Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, speaking before his team's game at Miami, said “these are scary times.” Rapidly evolving times, as well. Around 7 p.m., a person with knowledge of the situation told AP that owners — who met by teleconference Wednesday — were largely in support of a plan to play games in empty arenas on a short-term basis. About an hour later, the Thunder-Jazz game was halted before tip-off. And about 90 minutes after that, the season was called off, effective when the last whistle was to blow Wednesday night. That came even earlier than planned: The last game of the night's six-game slate, New Orleans at Sacramento, was called off as well because one of the referees assigned to work that Pelicans-Kings game, Courtney Kirkland, worked a Utah game on Monday. “The game was canceled out of an abundance of caution," the NBA said. There are 259 games, roughly 21% of the schedule, left to play this season — and no one knows if, or when, things will resume. Also shut down: The G League, the NBA's minor league where teams have somewhere between six and nine games left on their 50-game schedules. World Figure Skating Championships canceled The World Figure Skating Championships set for next week in Montreal have been canceled due to public health concerns. The event was scheduled to bring nearly 200 skaters from more than 50 countries to Montreal. It is the premier competition of the skating season in non-Olympic years. On Saturday, the Women’s World Hockey Championships in Nova Scotia were called off. Dover postponed NASCAR announced March 16 that Dover International Speedway’s May 1-3 tripleheader weekend in Dover, Delaware, is postponed to a future date. NASCAR said it is working to determine a new date. Trout stocking halted The Maryland Department of Natural Resources’ Fishing and Boating Services is temporarily stopping spring trout stocking effective immediately until further notice.

'On the front lines every day’: Grocery union calls for drastic change in shopper behavior citing coronavirus dangers 
.W
Jane St. Louis and many of her co-workers at Safeway in Damascus have never seen so many shoppers in their store and have never felt so afraid. “We are on the front lines every day,” said St. Louis, a 27-year employee of the store in Montgomery County. “Traffic has never been higher, and that scares us when some customers don’t do what is necessary to keep everyone safe. ... We can’t afford to see grocery stores shutting down or workers becoming too sick to work.” St. Louis and other members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union spoke out Monday about what they see as hazardous conditions for workers in stores across the United States, even as many supermarket chains have imposed aggressive restrictions to stem the spread of the new coronavirus. In many cases, union members said, shoppers either ignore social distancing guidelines or seem to be unaware of the harm they could cause themselves and others. The UFCW is urging customers to make drastic changes in shopping behaviors and patterns, launching a public safety initiative Monday that urges all shoppers to wear masks and respect social distancing. The union, in a joint effort with Safeway parent Albertsons Cos., also stepped up calls to states to designate supermarket workers “extended first responders” who then could be prioritized for testing and equipment such as masks and gloves. “The coronavirus pandemic represents probably the greatest health and safety crisis that American grocery and food workers have ever faced,” said Marc Perrone, UFCW international president. “Never in the history of this union have we been more concerned about the health an safety of food and grocery retail workers.” Grocers have started giving employees masks. Some offer hazard pay. But some employers have not been able to find enough protective equipment and have not expanded sick benefits, Perrone said. And he said only a handful of counties and cities are mandating that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask. “These are in fact transmission points for this virus,” Perrone said. “It is clear that unless something changes quickly, more and more of these workers will become sick and get exposed.” Last week, after an employee of Giant’s Largo supermarket died from the coronavirus, that grocer, along with Safeway, Weis Markets and others, intensified efforts to prevent the virus from spreading in their stores. For example, Giant, Safeway and Harris Teeter began limiting the number of customers allowed in stores, switched to one-way flow of traffic in aisles and encouraged customers to shop with as few family members as possible. Perrone estimated that 30 members across retail and food processing industries have died of COVID-19 and 3,000 are no longer at work because they have become sick or were exposed to an infected person. St. Louis, a member of UFCW Local 400, which represents Safeway and Giant workers in Maryland’s Washington suburbs, and other union members said shoppers often fail to wear masks or stay six feet away from others, shop with entire families, make frequent trips to stores, and discard masks and gloves in shopping carts and parking lots. “Please for the sake of all of our safety, wear a mask or face covering when you go shopping in a grocery store," St. Louis said. "We worry about your health, and we also worry about the health of other families too.” Janifer Suber, a worker at Vons in Lakewood, California, for more than two decades, said she has seen customers discard gloves and masks in the parking lot or in carts, which workers must then pick up. “We need customers to change how they shop,” Suber said. "Don’t make multiple trips and bring a list, so you don’ have to spend more time in a store. “I have seen firsthand the fear and concern that people in the community have, and my co-workers have about catching the virus," she said. “We worry about it every day, and the customers and the community are relying on us like never before.”

Applying the coronavirus stay-at-home approach to prisoners - post-pandemic | COMMENTARY
.W
Apparently, it takes a pandemic to push forward certain corrections reforms in Maryland. Years of activism, impassioned pleas, research reports and editorials outlining inequities and atrocities within the system were neither as effective nor as efficient in securing the swift release of hundreds of low-level offenders, including 200 children, as COVID-19. Since the new coronavirus swept into Maryland in force in March, the state has released more than 2,000 inmates, some awaiting trial, who were judged able to be safely monitored in the community or who were nearing the end of their sentences. And more are expected to be freed in the future, now that Maryland’s chief judge, Mary Ellen Barbera, has issued orders encouraging the release of nonviolent juveniles and adults amid the pandemic, and Gov. Larry Hogan has signed an executive order to speed up the process for those eligible for home detention or for release within the next four months. The governor also directed the Maryland Parole Commission to accelerate its consideration of older inmates serving sentences for nonviolent crimes and who are at risk for deadly complications from the disease. It was a stark turnaround from his stance just last month, when he responded to calls for low-risk prisoner release by saying “they’re safer where they are.” So, what brought on the change of heart? The detail that inmate living conditions — high turnover, cramped quarters, shared sinks and toilets — turn a prison sentence into potential death sentence? Or the mounting calls to release low-risk prisoners from defense attorneys, the ACLU, lawmakers and Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby? Maybe it was all that coupled with the long-understood knowledge that our justice system disproportionately targets African American men, offers little in the way of actual reform, and is largely made up of underprivileged people dealing with mental health and addiction issues. Whatever it was, we’re pleased there’s been some recognition of the reality that prison is not the only, or even the best, corrections scenario for many Marylanders caught up in the system. We also realize this is not the most pressing issue for many readers, especially now, when we’re all focused on our own uncertain health and comfort. But the fact is that much of this population wound up where they are because of circumstance — bad life experiences and, yes, choices, paired with a lack of opportunity, education and guidance. Helping them helps the rest of us, who, according to polls, consider crime a number one concern in the state. Prison reform, including reduced incarceration, lowers recidivism and saves taxpayers money, and who doesn’t want that? Governor Hogan has made a concerted effort to reduce the state’s prison population even before coronavirus, which has thus far claimed the lives of two Maryland prisoners. But he should have done more before now to empty prisons, jails and detention centers of those who didn’t absolutely have to be there. The past is gone, however. What concerns us now is whether this will be the model going forward, when coronavirus is no longer an immediate concern. Are these same strategies going to stick around? We sure hope so, because the issues with mass incarceration and inequality in the prison system are not going to go away when the virus does. The state should adopt common-sense sentencing guidelines permanently. Incarceration should always be a last resort as a crime deterrent and punishment. Instead, state efforts should be focused on crime prevention, along with improving probation services, community-based monitoring options and support systems to give people a fighting chance to succeed after they’ve paid their so-called debts to society. Put drug treatment and mental health counseling before tough on crime lock them up solutions. Society will benefit as a whole if we do. What do you say, governor? The stay-at-home approach could work in this area post-pandemic, too. The Baltimore Sun editorial board — made up of Opinion Editor Tricia Bishop, Deputy Editor Andrea K. McDaniels and writer Peter Jensen — offers opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers. It is separate from the newsroom.

Carroll County commissioners consider ways to cut costs as revenues dip due to coronavirus shutdowns
.W
Faced with a potential shortfall of $4 million in revenue for each month coronavirus shutdowns continue, the county commissioners are scouring next year’s budget for ways to cut costs and are considering whether services and staff should be reduced. The Board of Commissioners met for more than five hours on Thursday, spending the bulk of two meetings in budget talks, discussing what is mandated to be funded and what is not. Director of Management and Budget Ted Zaleski told the commissioners during a Tuesday work session that the county could lose $4 million of expected revenue per month for the duration of the shutdowns. He said total revenue could be more than $15 million under what was budgeted for fiscal year 2020 if closures continue through June. With no way of knowing how the coronavirus might affect the new fiscal year, which beings July 1, Zaleski strongly recommended the commissioners consider approving a 2021 budget that is less than the current operating budget of approximately $418 million. “There are no easy moves left to make," Zaleski said Thursday. "If there were, we would have taken them by now. The choices we have now all come with meaningful consequences.” The commissioners and budget staff reviewed more than 130 items in the budget, seeming to find little wiggle room. Zaleski said it would be difficult to pare the budget without affecting services. “In order to make any significant cuts, we’re talking about people,” said Commissioner Stephen Wantz, R-District 1. “We may need to discuss, perhaps, I don’t know, layoffs.” Commissioner Ed Rothstein, R-District 5, raised the idea of voluntary early retirement. Staff on the cusp of retiring could have the option to leave early, then the county could hire younger replacements and pay them less, he said. Zaleski noted the county would be losing valuable, experienced staff if they encouraged people to retire early. Commissioner Richard Weaver, R-District 2, suggested a hiring freeze for six months. Zaleski deemed that a short-term solution. After proposing to go back on the decision to extend Carroll Transit hours, Commissioner Eric Bouchat, R-District 4, suggested eliminating public transportation from the county budget entirely. Neither idea gained any ground with the other commissioners. Commissioner Dennis Frazier, R-District 3, asked budget staff to look into the police training academy and find whether it would save the county money to send recruits elsewhere to be trained. Zaleski said he can explore that, but noted outsourcing training could mean less slots would be available and positions may go unfilled for longer. Cuts to ag preservation, economic development The commissioners met with a few county department heads to find ways to reduce expenses in fiscal year 2021 and beyond. Jack Lyburn, director of economic development, said he would be comfortable reducing his department’s infrastructure and investment funding from $1.25 million to $850,000, based on its history of payments to the Industrial Development Authority of Carroll County. Funding that is not spent is transferred to the IDA. In the past four years, the Department of Economic Development has given $630,000, $820,000, $450,000, and $1.1 million to the IDA, according to Zaleski. Rothstein made a motion to reduce infrastructure and investment ongoing funding by $400,000, which will improve the overall budget’s bottom line. The board unanimously supported the motion. The commissioners disagreed over whether to reduce funding to agricultural land preservation. They voted 3-2 to decrease funding from $3 million to $2.5 million per year, ongoing. Frazier and Bouchat stood opposed. “In this county, agriculture preservation is incredibly important and I do not want to do anything that would challenge the continued effort moving forward,” Wantz said. Since 1980, the county has been moving toward a goal of preserving 100,000 acres of farmland. More than 73,000 acres have been preserved. Tom Devilbiss, the director of land and resource management, said the agricultural land preservation program is purely discretionary. It’s well-liked by the community and heavily used, but the commissioners are not obligated to fund it, he said. Rothstein suggested committing a $5 million bond to preservation, while withdrawing $500,000 in funding, to show the board’s long-term commitment to that goal. “We would show a commitment with the bond that we’re never going to let this go, 'cause I don’t ever want to let this go,” Rothstein said. Weaver, who earlier floated the idea of using a bond to support preservation, seconded Rothstein’s motion to reduce funding by $500,000 and commit the county to a $5 million bond. After the vote passed, Wantz said the commissioners could readjust their position in the future. “Right now, it’s a placeholder," he said. All decisions made by commissioners during budget meetings are conditional upon the budget being adopted, which must occur by the end of May.

Republicans to Maryland Gov. Hogan: Keep gun stores open during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Many of Maryland’s Republican state lawmakers are urging Gov. Larry Hogan to keep gun stores open, one day after more than 50 Democrats asked him to shut them down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Maryland’s House of Delegates Republican Caucus sent a letter Friday to the Republican governor pressing him to keep gun stores as “essential businesses.” “Without a doubt, Marylanders should be at home unless seeking or providing some essential service,” they wrote. “Protecting oneself and family is not just an essential service, it is an essential human right.” The letter was signed by Minority Leader Del. Nic Kipke of Anne Arundel County and Minority Whip Kathy Szeliga, who represents Harford and Baltimore counties. The Republican Caucus has 42 members. The Hogan administration has relied on federal guidance in determining what businesses are deemed “essential” and can remain open. The most recent recommendation from the federal government includes gun retailers alongside manufacturers as businesses that can remain open. “Federal guidelines expressly designate gun stores as essential, and the governor’s orders adhere to the federal guidelines," Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci said in a statement Thursday. The Republicans took exception with the letter sent by Democratic lawmakers the day before saying they “recognize the temptation to use a public health crisis as a backdrop for political virtue signaling.” “Some members of the General Assembly have built their careers on trying to put gun stores out of business, well before any pandemic,” they wrote. More than 50 Democratic delegates and senators urged Hogan to close gun stores, raising concerns about people “stockpiling” weapons and increased access to guns that could lead to gun violence and accidents.

Hunt Valley-based Omega Healthcare reports 57 coronavirus cases in its nursing homes
.W
Omega Healthcare Investors, a Hunt Valley-based real estate investment trust focused on elder care facilities, said it has at least 57 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in its nursing homes in 14 states and the United Kingdom. The cases, none in Maryland, have involved 42 residents and 15 employees in 28 facilities, all but one of which are skilled nursing homes, Omega said in an update on the impact of COVID-19 on its business. Omega owns the properties, 964 facilities in 40 states and the U.K., and leases them to operators. Omega did not identify the facilities or states in which residents and employees have tested positive for the virus. The company’s website shows it owns 12 facilities in Maryland, and a spokesman said none of the reported cases were at those homes. Many of its operators have seen significant cost increases stemming from higher overtime and bonus pay and an increase in the cost and use of personal protective equipment and supplies. “We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operators and to support their efforts to manage this unprecedented challenge,” Omega CEO Taylor Pickett said in a statement. He said expanded Medicaid reimbursements, part of federal and state relief, will offer “meaningful support” to the facilities. The company also expects that recently announced government relief could offset the sharp increase in costs. “We remain in frequent contact with our operators, and believe they are working tirelessly to implement appropriate protocols, in line with [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] guidelines, to limit exposure and spread of the COVID-19 virus,” Pickett said. Those protocols include use of daily screenings and isolation techniques. The real estate investment trust, which invests in both skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, said it has not seen any material change in the financial performance of its business. The company plans to update its guidance when it releases first-quarter financial results. Earnings guidance for the year does not include the potential impact of the pandemic.

State Sen. Mary Washington suspends campaign for Baltimore mayor to focus on coronavirus
.W
State Sen. Mary Washington announced Monday she was suspending her campaign for Baltimore mayor to focus on the coronavirus pandemic. “The extraordinary events of the past several weeks have drastically changed our way of life in Baltimore and across the nation. During this unprecedented time, I am deeply committed, first and foremost, to standing by the people of the 43rd District as their state senator,” the Democrat said in a statement. Washington will be working in Annapolis through Wednesday as the General Assembly rapidly passes key bills ahead of an early adjournment. Lawmakers are expected to prioritize the most important legislation, including the state budget and education measures. “This is a time to set politics aside, as the health, safety, and well-being of my constituents must come first," Washington said. “I have always followed the work, and right now, this is where I am needed most.” Baltimore’s mayoral primary is scheduled for April 28. Washington leaves a Democratic field that includes Mayor Bernard C. "Jack Young, City Council President Brandon Scott, former Mayor Sheila Dixon, former state Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah, former Baltimore Police Department spokesman T.J. Smith and former U.S. Treasury official Mary Miller. Washington does not plan to endorse another candidate at this time, according to a campaign spokeswoman. Mileah Kromer, director of Goucher College’s Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center, said Washington’s exit leaves a hole in the race. She was a “clear progressive” with a strong connection to state government and an academic background. In such a crowded primary, with so much of the electorate undecided, Kromer said Washington’s voice could make an impact. “If she decides to endorse and get behind somebody, she could be a powerful surrogate to have,” she said. A February poll by The Baltimore Sun, the University of Baltimore and WYPR-FM showed Washington with 5% support among likely Democratic primary voters, with a third of voters polled undecided. She had roughly $116,000 cash on hand, according to her most recent campaign finance filing in January. Washington jumped into the mayoral race because she said the city needs a competent leader with a progressive vision. She’d often remark: “Baltimore’s not a poor city; we’ve just been poorly run." Washington is known as one of the most progressive leaders in the legislature. She served in the House of Delegates from 2010 to 2018 representing North Baltimore. In 2018, she unseated incumbent Sen. Joan Carter Conway. Groups such as SEIU Local 500, NARAL Pro-Choice MD, Baltimore Women United and Our Revolution endorsed her. Now, instead of campaigning, Washington said she will help put together a “resource response team” this week to assist residents who may not be able to leave their homes. She also said she will work with local businesses owners facing major economic hardship as people withdraw from public life in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic, which has upended life across the globe, also has changed how local candidates are campaigning. Just two weeks ago, candidates were making small adjustments: going for an elbow bump rather than a handshake and offering hand sanitizer to voters when meeting them. But now, as the virus spreads, campaigns are scaling back dramatically. Candidates are calling voters instead of knocking on doors, holding virtual events rather than in-person fundraisers and asking their campaign staff to telecommute. Several also are encouraging voters to request absentee ballots in light of federal recommendations to avoid large gatherings, like those common at polls. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said Monday that the state is “working on contingencies” for the primary as other states decide to either postpone or offer mail-only voting for their upcoming elections. The directors of local election boards across Maryland delivered a letter last week to the state Board of Elections, urging its officials to move to mail-only voting. Other mayoral candidates thanked Washington for what she brought to the discussion and her service to the people of Baltimore from the General Assembly. No one else announced their intention to drop out. Smith said he spent a lot of time with Washington during the campaign by virtue of being seated alphabetically at events, and came to have a great deal of respect for the senator. “Personally, I’m going to miss her, because she brought a different perspective," he said. “Even though she was an elected official, she felt like an outsider.” Baltimore Sun reporter Emily Opilo contributed to this article.

Baltimore chef: Delete your food delivery apps while restaurants struggle under coronavirus restrictions
.W
A Baltimore chef took to Instagram over the weekend with a bold message for housebound diners: “Delete your food delivery apps." With restaurants closed to dine-in service during the coronavirus pandemic, many area eateries are relying on delivery and carryout business more than ever. But chef Ashish Alfred wants customers to stop ordering food through apps like Uber Eats. Such apps typically take a commission of around 30% per order, a huge amount for businesses already struggling, Alfred said. Apps are in effect “killing” restaurants, he added. While restaurants are suffering, “The best thing that you can do for us,” Alfred said, in addition to staying at home, is to “delete every food delivery app that you have on your phone.” Alfred’s restaurants, including Duck Duck Goose in Fells Point and two restaurants in Bethesda, are closed during the coronavirus pandemic. Reached by phone, he declined to comment for this article. Ronny Thammasathiti, manager at Mayuree Thai Tavern, said that platforms like Grubhub can help small businesses with limited resources for advertising to gain customers who wouldn’t otherwise know about their business. But, Thammasathiti acknowledged, “If you really want to help out the local restaurant, of course it would be helpful to order directly.” Steve Chu, founder of Ekiben, compared food delivery apps to bottled water — customers know the drawbacks, but guiltily use them anyway because of the convenience. “During this pandemic, while so many restaurants are teetering on the brink of collapse, these apps should waive or even discount their fees to show support to the community they’ve been profiting off for so long,” Chu wrote in a text message. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Grubhub said the company’s “mission is to help keep restaurant doors open through delivery and takeout.” The Chicago-based company also says it is working with government officials to allow kitchens to stay open for pickup and delivery amid the shutdown. Grubhub, which also owns Seamless, has suspended collection of up to $100 million in commission payments from restaurants impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Restaurant owners will need to pay the money back eventually. While Uber officials said in a statement that they “support efforts to help the hospitality industry,” the company has kept its commission rates steady in the midst of the crisis. Changing its rates, they argued, would “set a far-reaching precedent in a highly competitive market.” In San Francisco, where Uber is based, city officials have intervened to cap the amount apps can charge restaurants. Eater reported last week that an emergency order backed by the city’s mayor and two members of its Board of Supervisors would force third party delivery companies to charge commissions of no more than 15%. DoorDash has announced that it will cut commission fees in half for small restaurants through the end of May.

Maryland retailers prepare for unknown future after ‘crippling’ losses as coronavirus spreads
.W
Shop owner Kohli Flick knew Saturday night that she faced a wrenching decision. As the gravity of the rapidly spreading new coronavirus sunk in, she weighed whether to temporarily close her successful home goods and gift store in Greenspring Station. It would mean forgoing a lot of sales and all of her help for who knows how long. Just 24 hours later, the answer seemed clear. She told her six-person, part-time staff at Becket Hitch not to come to work. Behind shuttered doors Monday, she quickly built up a small online presence, filling online orders and shipping goods, then showing products on Instagram: Easter goods, clothing and candles. She has been making deliveries to customers who live near Lutherville-Timonium or running out to meet them curbside. “It’s not business as normal,” said Flick, who doubled her selling space a year ago and now is watching sales dwindle to about a quarter of what she sees regularly. “At this point, the numbers are so far gone, that whatever there is is great. I’m just grateful for every sale or gift card that’s purchased.” What began as a trickle of stores announcing temporary closures has become a steady flow as dozens of big and small retailers take steps to slow the spread of the disease known as COVID-19 and keep even small crowds away. On Thursday, Gov. Larry Hogan ordered all malls across the state closed at 5 p.m. It’s uncertain whether store closures will stretch beyond the two weeks most retailers have tentatively set, but even in a best-case scenario, some experts believe shoppers will stay away at least through April. And when the dust settles, they expect store closures, layoffs and even chainwide shutdowns on a massive scale in an industry already undergoing a shakeout from online competition and changing shopper habits. The retail sector has accounted for the most layoffs in the past three years because of store closures, said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Where it will continue to change is this demand shock that we’re facing as people self-quarantine and stop going to stores and purchasing products,” Challenger said. “Most service jobs cannot be done in person and require foot traffic from customers to stay afloat. Retailers that have already invested in e-commerce are going to have a huge advantage, and small mom-and-pop retailers are going to have by far the most difficult time." Across the nation, more than 60 U.S. retailers have reportedly made decisions in recent days to voluntarily close stores, joining schools, universities, restaurants and an array of public places as Americans are urged to stay home. Among those closing are department stores, such as Macy’s and Nordstrom, and mall and specialty stores, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Under Armour. Most retailers are hoping consumers will buy online instead and directed shoppers to their websites. Nordstrom, for example, emailed customers Wednesday offering 25% off online orders with some exclusions. In Maryland, where three cases confirmed March 5 grew to 107 by Thursday, including a 5-year-old girl, and one person has died, the retail closings followed Hogan’s shutdown of schools, casinos, restaurants, bars, theaters and gyms. On Thursday, the governor also restricted access to public transportation and BWI Marshall Airport and banned gatherings of more than 10 people. Retailers most at risk include companies that were already struggling, such as JCPenney, Kohl’s and Macy’s and mall stores such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Urban Outfitters, suffering from declining foot traffic in centers, said Karyl Leggio, a finance professor at Loyola University Maryland’s Sellinger School of Business. Retailers, coming out of a weak holiday season and many already burdened with excess winter inventory, will feel the ripple effect of the national slowdown in travel and tourism. Leggio agreed that any retailer without a strong online presence likely will struggle. Meanwhile, Target and Walmart, which sell groceries and other staples, should be able to weather the crisis, she said. “If you are located in the mall right now, this is the worst possible scenario, shutting malls and a decline in interest of people going to the malls,” she said. “Now you’re removing the shopper." Leggio suspects retail will be lower on the list of essential services, such as airlines, that the government is likely to assist. On Wednesday, the National Retail Federation urged President Donald Trump and congressional leaders to help retailers, citing access to credit as the top priority until consumers return to the market. “Labor and benefit obligations, rents, loan payments are all crippling burdens if no sales are being made for days or weeks at a time, and our members are suffering cumulative losses that amount to tens of billions of dollars a week,” the trade organization said in a letter to the White House and others. The group called for a direct, government-backed loan program to offer a bridge to a time when normal business resumes. For smaller retailers, recovery will prove most difficult, business owners and experts say. “What everything is going to look like at the end of this is going to be completely different from what we have known so far,” said Flick, the owner of Becket Hitch. “There are going to be some businesses that don’t recover.” Timing could hardly be worse for stores such as Wee Chic, a children’s clothing and toy shop in Greenspring Station and Fairfax, Virginia, that counts the period leading up to spring break and Easter as its biggest season. Owner and president Bridget Quinn Stickline said she is accepting one-on-one in-store appointments and taking orders by phone for delivery. She has seen two to three people a day, as opposed to 60 to 80, a drop she called “crippling.” “We do not have an e-commerce site and are scrambling to get one up,” Stickline said. “Kids still need Easter baskets. We’re here in the shop. We can build Easter baskets for you and drop them off or ship or have you pick up at the curb. “We don’t run our business on the edge," she said, “but we’re a small business, so there is an end to how long we could sustain having no income.” Stickline said she believes major retailers may be able to weather the crisis, but she worries about her small-business friends and neighbors. “Amazon is going to be fine," she said. "Those of us that don’t sell hand sanitizer and toilet paper and milk and eggs and bread are going to need a lot of special attention for a while.”

Maryland fines Charles County nursing home with most coronavirus deaths in state for failing to protect residents, staff
.W
Saying Sagepoint Nursing and Rehabilitation Center jeopardized the health and safety of its residents, the Maryland Department of Health is fining the Charles County facility $10,000 a day dating to March 30 for “widespread deficiencies” in testing, providing its staff with protective equipment and isolating those who tested positive for the coronavirus. Sagepoint, which has more deaths than any other nursing home in Maryland, came under scrutiny as officials sought to control the spread of the virus through such facilities, sites of nearly three in five COVID-19 deaths in the state. According to Maryland data, at least 34 residents and one staff member at the home in La Plata have died of the respiratory disease and 97 residents and 32 employees have tested positive for the coronavirus. “Your facility failed to implement an effective infection control program,” said a letter to Sagepoint dated Wednesday and signed by Dr. Patricia Tomsko Nay, executive director of the health department’s Office of Health Care Quality. The fine is the first civil penalty the state has imposed on a senior living facility since the coronavirus began its spread. “Based on the seriousness of these findings, it is imperative that you immediately determine the measures that are necessary to correct these deficient practices, what systemic changes you will develop to ensure that this does not happen again, and what quality improvement process will be implemented to oversee the system,” Nay wrote. Sagepoint officials said in a statement they “strongly disagree with the findings contained in the letter, and we will be disputing them directly to the Office of Health Care Quality." The statement, posted on the home’s website, went on to say “it would be inappropriate and highly irregular to respond” to the news media before it follows the dispute process. The citations caught some Charles County officials by surprise because they said they were led to believe Sagepoint was getting the problem under control. State Del. C T. Wilson, a Democrat who represents the county, said he had asked Sagepoint officials about reports that staff did not have adequate protective gear. He said he was told that wasn’t true. “It kind of looks like it was,” Wilson said. “I’m beyond furious. These are all very serious violations. This is so crushing to see.” Reuben B. Collins II, the president of the Board of Charles County Commissioners, said he, too, was under the impression from regular briefings by Dr. Howard Haft, a physician assigned by the Maryland Department of Health to oversee the county’s response to the coronavirus crisis, that “things were for the most part under control.” A YouTube video of Haft’s April 21 briefing to the council shows council members asking him about testing, data and devices for family members to communicate with residents of nursing homes now that in-person visits were not allowed. After a council member, Thomasina O. Coates, asks “what aggressive process are you putting in place to combat what’s already happening,” apparently in reference to Sagepoint’s number of cases and deaths, Haft details what he and other health officials have done. "I reviewed the process that was in place there,” said Haft, going on to mention testing for all staff and residents and separating residents according to their test results. “All of those things were put into place and documented,” he said. He said he asked specialists in infection control at the department to conduct a “more granular” review as well. “They reported back there was complete compliance there," Haft said. Haft could not be reached for comment Thursday. According to Nay’s letter, the state began its survey April 21 and continued through May 6 ″to determine if your facility was in compliance with State regulations. “This survey found that your facility was not in substantial compliance with the State regulations," the letter said. "In fact, conditions at your facility posed immediate and serious jeopardy to the health and safety of your residents.” The letter accuses the facility of failing to obtain lab results in a timely manner, use appropriate hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, and group together those with known or suspected cases of COVID-19. Previously, the facility has said it “fought hard” to test all residents but received “little support from any local or state agencies.” It attributed its high death rate to the age and medical vulnerability of its residents, who on average are 89 years old. Asked for an earlier Sun article about staff complaints that they did not have adequate personal protective equipment and had to arrange for their own coronavirus tests, Sagepoint spokeswoman Joyce Riggs said the facility “always had and issued the appropriate PPE to follow the CDC guidelines at each stage however acquiring PPE through all supply chain sources has been and continues to be challenging. “There were not enough test kits available to universally test staff initially,” Riggs said. “Staff who needed to be tested due to symptoms or exposure were directed to follow up with their primary care provider for screening and testing.” For Tammy Semega of La Plata, the news of the state’s crackdown on the facility comes at a bitter moment: Her father, who tested positive for the virus in April, died there Wednesday. “They need to be closed down,” Semega said. “They don’t deserve to be taking care of our elderly. “Look at the numbers," she said. “They did not run this right.” Semega said she had called and filed multiple complaints about Sagepoint, because employees had been saying they were short-staffed and did not have enough protective equipment. She said her father had lost more than 30 pounds because he wasn’t eating and it seemed there wasn’t enough staff to make sure that he did, Semega said. She was told April 10 that her father, Michael Fanase, a 91-year-old who had fought in World War II, tested positive for the coronavirus, although he appeared to have only minor symptoms. A second test was negative but because he had a slight fever, he was moved to an area for those who tested positive, she said. While the state findings echo some of what she and other family members have been saying, that offers little comfort, she said. “I won’t feel vindicated until their doors are closed,” she said.

Westminster church offers drive-thru confessionals in the age of social distancing for coronavirus
.W
As the coronavirus spreads in Maryland, Carroll County residents have not been permitted to gather in groups of 10 or more. One Westminster church has found a way to offer an important service of faith to its parish. St. John Roman Catholic Church in Westminster has been offering drive-thru confessionals as an alternative way to help members of the community exercise their faith while also social distancing. “Everyone knows when you go to Burger King or when you go to Chik-fil-A or you go through a drive-thru — you kind of pull up to the window, you place your order — so we kind of set it up the same way as a drive-thru experience,” said Father Mark Bialek of St. John. “In order to make sure that we maintain the 10 or less restriction that we have on social gatherings, basically everybody stays in their cars. So everybody stays quarantined in their cars and what they do is, they form a line, they pull up to where the priest is, the priest is six feet from the curb, so we’re six feet away. The person lowers their window, we celebrate the Sacrament of Reconciliation with them and then they’re done.” The concept of social distancing, which is recommended by health professionals and state officials, requires people to stay at least 6 feet apart in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. According to Emily Alster, communications coordinator for St. John Roman Catholic Church, they have tried to stick to their regular times for confessions: 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Wednesdays; 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays; and 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Sundays. The confessions started March 18, and they had a bigger turnout than expected, Bialek said. “We were surprised at the response,” he said. “We had over 70 cars show up between those two hours, so I heard confessions for about two and a half hours. People were very patient, people stayed in their cars and we got through all the confessions.” The drive-thru confessions were inspired from another parish in Bowie that they saw on Facebook. According to Bialek, after they announced it to the St. John parish, they have received a “very good” response. The coronavirus pandemic, also know by the disease it causes, COVID-19, came in the midst of the Catholic Lenten season, a prominent time for worship. “This is kind of the peak time when Catholics are seeking to go to the Sacrament of Reconciliation. So, to be able to offer it to be able to extend the opportunity is very, very important,” Bialek said. “We’re really trying to think outside the box, which is the four walls of our church. So, right now our people cannot get to their pastors, people cannot get to their priests, so we are bringing the pastor, we’re bringing the priests to them.” Parishioners have been offering thanks and support for their work, according to Bialek. “They really do want to be able to celebrate the sacraments of the church, which can only happen in person,” Bialek said. “There’s a number of things that we can do online and through live streaming. But the sacraments have to be in person we cannot offer the sacrament, say through Skype, or live streaming, it has to be done in person. So they are just very, very thankful that they that we are bringing Christ to the people. We’re bringing Jesus to the people.” The confessions aren’t just limited to those who are members of St. John Roman Catholic Church; people from all over have come to participate, according to Alster. “I know for a fact we had, I saw on one Saturday, I saw a couple of Pennsylvania license plates. I’m pretty sure we had some people from St. Barts [St. Bartholomew Roman Catholic Church] in Manchester,” Alster said. “Didn’t talk too much to the people, again, trying to maintain that distance. Not sure how far people were coming, but I do know there are people from different parishes.”

Baltimore public works officials announce restrictions amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
Recreational activities at the Liberty, Loch Raven, and Prettyboy reservoirs will be suspended and additional restrictions by Baltimore public works will be in place starting Monday. Beginning Monday, staff who can work from home will remain home, and services such as the water billing call center and customer walk-in center at the Abel Wolman Municipal Building will close, Baltimore Department of Public Works officials said. Only emergency water maintenance issues will be addressed. “This action will ensure we have a reserve of staff knowledgeable and capable of performing the critical functions,” Baltimore City Department of Public Works Acting Director Matthew W. Garbark said in a statement. The reductions at DPW extend to the three reservoirs operated by the city, where all recreational activities, including hiking, biking and horseback riding will be suspended, but the city’s park facilities, operated by the parks department, will remain open. Curbside trash pickup and recycling pickup will continue, and the six drop-off centers will remain open. Disposal services will continue at the Quarantine Road Landfill and the Northwest Transfer Facility, but the Quarantine Road Landfill will no longer accept cash or credit card transactions. Additional services, such as street and alley cleaning, graffiti removal, rat abatement, and bulk trash pickup will be suspended. Construction, engineering, and maintenance projects not deemed essential will be suspended, officials said. Prequalification for contractors/consultants will be automatically extended for three months.

Jobless claims double, with 84,000 Marylanders filing for unemployment as coronavirus shutters businesses
.W
Unemployment claims in Maryland and across the country last week doubled over the record-setting surge of job losses the week before, as businesses continue to shut their doors in response to the coronavirus pandemic. More than 84,000 Marylanders filed for unemployment during the week ending March 28, up from 42,334 residents the week before, according to the state Department of Labor. They were among more than 6.6 million Americans who filed jobless claims, up from 3.3 million the previous week. The latest signs of the virus’ economic impact came as its human toll continued to steadily climb. State health officials reported five more deaths Thursday from COVID-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus, bringing Maryland’s death toll to 36. More than 2,300 people in the state are infected now, a 17% day-to-day jump, health officials said. “This fight against the coronavirus is going to take every one of us working together,” Gov. Larry Hogan said Thursday morning on "The Laurie DeYoung Show” on Baltimore’s WPOC radio. While there were 346 new positive coronavirus cases confirmed in Maryland, another 18,890 COVID-19 tests have come back negative and 81 people have been released from isolation, health officials said. Still officials believe COVID-19 continues to spread across Maryland and any peak is likely weeks away. After new clusters of infections were confirmed in several senior citizen facilities across the Baltimore region Wednesday, involving both residents and staff, Carroll County officials said Thursday that three more cases have been confirmed at Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster. They include two women and a man, all in their 90s, bringing the total cases at the retirement community to seven — six residents and one staffer. At Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where the state’s first facility outbreak was reported and five of the 95 residents have died, results for staff tests came through Thursday. Of 63 staffers, 18 have tested positive for COVID-19, 24 tested negative and results are pending for 21. Among residents, there were 77 positive tests. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Transition Center in Baltimore is on full quarantine after a corrections officer tested positive for the virus, Maryland’s prison system confirmed late Wednesday. The latest unemployment data represent a dramatic climb that has occurred since Hogan and the leaders of most other states have ordered nonessential businesses to close their doors and for residents to stay at home whenever possible. If Maryland Transit Administration ridership is any indication, more people are listening to that directive. Overall bus ridership dropped by more than half last week, and the agency plans to temporarily suspend service beginning Monday on 11 routes that are experiencing an average 82% drop in ridership “in order to more efficiently deploy resources to core bus service,” officials said Thursday. But at the same time the economic paralysis is overwhelming systems for processing unemployment claims, leading to delays and problems for some filers. “We have experienced an unprecedented surge in claims traffic," Tiffany Robinson, the state’s labor secretary, ahead of the latest jobless report, said Wednesday during a conference call with state lawmakers serving on a coronavirus work group. Maryland’s 400 workers who process unemployment claims typically handle about 2,000 claims per week, she said. They’ve been working extra hours and on Saturdays to process the surge in applications. Residents who usually work full-time or part-time are eligible for unemployment. Under state and federal legislation passed to address losses during the pandemic, benefits are also now available to some people who have not been formally laid off or work in “gig economy” jobs if they have lost work because of coronavirus-related closures or slumps in demand. To better process the surge in claims, the state Department of Labor is encouraging those who have lost their jobs to stagger when they call or go online to request assistance. Those with last names A through F are asked to file on Mondays, last names G through N on Tuesdays and last names O through Z on Wednesdays, and all names on Thursday and Friday. Robinson said Marylanders will be helped whenever they call, but she said she hoped the voluntary system could spread out the work. The state phone system for unemployment claims runs from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. weekdays, and applicants also can file for benefits online. The online system has been overloaded with people filing claims, so Robinson suggested going on the website early in the morning or late at night. She asked lawmakers to spread the word to constituents that they will receive unemployment checks even if it takes some time. “Benefits will be paid, back through the time they were separated from employment,” Robinson said. “Just because they can’t get through now, or they’re having trouble now doesn’t mean that they’re not going to get their benefits.” Another challenge for processing claims is that many applicants are applying for unemployment for the first time, and are unfamiliar with the terminology and details of how the program works, Robinson said. Her workers are doing their best to walk applicants through the process. “Some of the calls that we are taking are Marylanders who are dealing with some of the worst situations they’ve dealt with. They are worried and concerned,” she said. “And yet our 400 state unemployment insurance employees are also going through this pandemic. They’re worried about their own families and they are coming in to work.” Among the counties, Baltimore County had the highest number of overall unemployment claims, with 13,352 reported claims, according to the department. In Baltimore City, 8,685 residents filed for unemployment benefits. Job losses are most concentrated on a per-capita basis in Worcester County, where the start of the Ocean City summer tourism season is on hold and 45 people per 1,000 have filed for unemployment. Statewide, about 20 people per 1,000 filed for unemployment in March. In all, about 10 million people have lost their jobs across the country since the coronavirus outbreak began here. And economists expect more losses to come — envisioning as many as 20 million lost jobs by the end of April. The unemployment rate, which is reported on a monthly basis, could spike to as high as 15% nationally in March, above the previous record of 10.8% set during a deep recession in 1982.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo seek $500B in federal aid for states battling coronavirus
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who chairs the National Governors Association, is seeking $500 billion in aid from Congress to help states facing looming budget shortfalls amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hogan, a Republican, issued a joint statement with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who serves as the association’s vice chair, on Saturday, saying the help is badly needed for states that have been “leading the on-the-ground response to the national COVID-19 pandemic.” “Congress must appropriate an additional $500 billion specifically for all states and territories to meet the states’ budgetary shortfalls that have resulted from this unprecedented public health crisis,” the statement said. “This critical stabilization funding for states must be separate from much needed fiscal stabilization for local government.” The request was announced just a day after Maryland officials announced potentially dire budget shortfalls, including up to a $2.8 billion revenue loss by the end of June, if the stay-at-home order remains in place that long. If the order extends through May, State Comptroller Peter Franchot said the state could lose about $1.5 billion. The grim projections led Hogan to announce a state budget freeze, including a statewide hiring freeze and possible cuts elsewhere in the state budget. Hogan said the state will only spend money on coronavirus-related expenses and payroll. Hogan and Cuomo said the recently passed federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which has provided some relief, does not provide any direct aid to states and territories that are grappling with upcoming budget shortfalls. “There’s frustration among governors that CARES Act resources can’t be used for budget stabilization,” Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci tweeted Saturday. He said the statement follows a call Thursday between the governors and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. The governors warn that if the request is not granted, it will cause adverse economic effects across the country. “In the absence of unrestricted fiscal support of at least $500 billion from the Federal government, states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to critically important services all across this country, hampering public health, the economic recovery, and-in turn-our collective effort to get people back to work,” they said. The Associated Press reports that the White House and congressional leaders appear likely to launch talks on a new coronavirus aid package as soon as this coming week. Maryland officials announced Saturday morning 726 new confirmed cases and another 35 deaths between Friday and Saturday, raising the total death toll above 200. Of the more than 18,800 deaths from the coronavirus reported in the U.S., over 7,800 have been in New York state.

John Carroll School to close for two weeks amid coronavirus concerns; will move to online learning
.W
The John Carroll School in Bel Air announced it will transition to online learning from March 16 to March 27, the same time that the state’s public schools with close amid concerns regarding the novel coronavirus. “The John Carroll School is taking every precaution to keep students, staff and our community safe and will transition to online learning from Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 27. These dates could be extended as the situation continues to evolve. Following tomorrow’s early dismissal for students at 12:45, all faculty and staff will be preparing to deploy the school’s online learning systems," Principal Tom Durkin wrote in a message sent to parents. "Students and families can expect to receive another email tomorrow with more information, including guidelines to provide more specific direction for students during this period,” he wrote. Starting Friday, all events, including athletic practices and games and SATs, scheduled to take place at John Carroll during this period are canceled, as are all school-sponsored trips to other locations. The school will assess the feasibility of rescheduling the events once students and faculty return. “We ask that all students departing campus tomorrow clear out their lockers in the event we need to restrict access to campus for a longer period,” Durkin wrote.

Sykesville family creates comic book to help those with autism understand tumultuous times caused by coronavirus
.W
A Century High School junior with autism was used to her routine and the comfort of knowing what each day would entail. But because of school closure and other measures taken to slow the spread of COVID-19, her world is now filled with frustration and uncertainty as she adapts to a 24/7 life at home. To help her understand this new normal, Deborah Brusio’s family, who lives in Sykesville, created a comic book in which she is the central figure, “Debbie Fights Coronavirus,” that they hope will “edutain” anyone with autism. “It’s a tangible form of what is a popular term being used now, ‘edutainment,’ and that is educating people and entertaining them at the same time; that’s the model for ‘Debbie Fights Coronavirus,’" said Vincent Brusio, Deborah’s father. "It’s portable, it’s full of color, it’s a PDF format so it can be seen on any plane, any tablet any computer because of the universal application.” Vincent was in charge of publishing the comic book, his wife Julie used her teaching background to edit and oversee production and their son Joseph, who attends Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, helped with the artwork. The comic went live on March 31 on Pathfinders for Autism website’s coronavirus page and after some marketing, it will also be on Autism Speaks website and the Facebook page for the Carroll County Public Library’s Eldersburg branch, Vincent said. Deborah was the perfect model for the comic book, Vincent said, because of her facial expressions. “Comments we’ve been getting from people and, particularly with Autism Speaks, said they’ve really liked how well Deb models for the book because people with autism respond a lot to facial expressions,” he said. “Deb’s really good at creating a variety of different faces that we were able to use for the comic, everything from fear to exhaustion to determination to being inquisitive to shock value, she’s really good at expressing a lot of different facial expressions. "That really comes across, especially on the cover where she’s standing with her fist in the air, all defiant with my son’s coronavirus bug coming at her full tilt.” Debbie was diagnosed with autism when she was 3 years old. She also has a trained ear for the piano, although she isn’t always inclined to take requests, according to Julie. Julie hopes this book helps others reconcile what his going on during this confusing time. “I really hope that this book helps kids understand that even though they’re at home and their normal routines have altogether stopped, that it brings them an understanding of other things they can do in place of those normal routines,” said Julie. “And that it’s OK to be upset at this time and frustrated because it is an incredibly hard and frustrating time for everybody and it’s normal to have to be upset. So I just hope that brings some comfort and it helps to support their understanding of what’s going on.” Debbie enjoyed participating in the comic book amid all the uncertainty while staying at home, her father said. "She really likes doing what she can, I mean it takes a while to get everything done because you can only do so much in a short period of time,” said Vincent. “Yes, she’s very open to doing something like this, she’s really, really good to work with.” A realtor now, Vincent used his 23-year career in the comic book industry to teach his daughter things like social distancing. “Creating social stories to help her came naturally to me because people with autism, they think in pictures, they process ideas in pictures rather than words,” said Vincent. “So, putting together social stories to help her along came natural to me. "She was having a very difficult time trying to understand why she couldn’t go back to the life that she had because of social distancing and things like that. School was closed and she was having a very hard time trying to understand why her life was turned upside down. So, I started originally creating a social story using images off the internet. But then when I started putting it together, I thought, this might be something that could be put online for other people to use as well.” According to Vincent, Debbie hasn’t read the finished product because she has to take it in bit by bit and process it, but he hopes to make a video of her reading it to post online. Julie said she was excited when Vincent came up with the idea to teach Debbie with a comic book that could help others but had initial concerns. “So, my reaction when my husband first told me about his idea was I thought it was a really great idea,” said Julie. “My concern was that if he grabbed images that he might run into issues with copyright. And so that’s when he thought, ‘Well, let’s use Debbie as the model and that way, it’s a story for her.’ "And then it spoke to a general audience instead of being like, a typical social story for kids where when you have a typical social story for people with disabilities, it’s written in the first person. Since this was written in the third person, it’s really, it’s really great for anybody, including small children to understand what’s going on.”

3 more die from coronavirus outbreak at Mount Airy nursing home; Hogan: Staffer without symptoms may have introduced virus
.W
A total of five residents have died from a large outbreak of the coronavirus at a Carroll County nursing home, county officials said Tuesday. The third, fourth and fifth residents of Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy to die from the virus were two men in their 70s and a woman in her 60s, each with underlying conditions, the Carroll County Health Department said. Two others — a man in his 80s and another in his 90s — had previously been pronounced dead. Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday night in a C-SPAN interview that a staff member without symptoms may have introduced the virus to the nursing home, where it “went like wildfire.” A total of 77 people connected to Pleasant View, which had 95 residents at the start of the outbreak, have tested positive, officials have said. Eighteen residents tested negative. The first positive cases at the facility were reported Friday. Officials said Tuesday that staff were being tested as well. Nursing homes are the focus of significant concern as health officials seek to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected at least 1,650 Marylanders and killed 22. On Tuesday, officials reported that five residents at a Northeast Baltimore nursing home, FutureCare’s Cold Spring facility in Lauraville, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The five cases involve a mix of residents and staff members, two of whom are hospitalized, city health officials said Wednesday. The site provides skilled nursing and dialysis services, city health officials said. A FutureCare spokeswoman could not be reached for comment. On Monday, officials at the Residences at Vantage Point in Columbia said a resident of the retirement community who recently died at a hospital had tested positive for COVID-19. Also Monday, officials reported that a resident at Erickson Living’s Oak Crest retirement community in Parkville has tested positive for the virus. Wider outbreaks have occurred in nursing homes in states including Washington, New Jersey, Arkansas and Illinois. City health officials said they are working with FutureCare to trace contact the residents had with others in the facility and ensuring staff have proper protective equipment and enough space to isolate the infected residents. FutureCare operates 15 facilities in Maryland, most of them in Baltimore. The company provides care for people on dialysis and those with lung illnesses that require ventilators, according to its website. Carroll County officials said they were taking steps to control infection and treat the Pleasant View residents who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Some have been moved to hospitals. Carroll Hospital, for example, said it was caring for 12 patients and one employee from Pleasant View. Rebecca Travels, the nursing home’s administrator, has lamented the lack of testing availability in the lead-up to the outbreak at her facility. “As an industry, as an administrator, one of the frustrating things, I think, for all of us at that time, was the lack of availability, the lack of access to testing,” Travels said. “I don’t want this to happen to anyone else."

Former Harford resident talks about her family living in Italy during national coronavirus lockdown
.W
Melissa Innocenti and her family arrived in Italy on Jan. 20, having moved from their former home in Harford County as her husband started a new job as a U.S. Army civilian employee on a military post near the city of Vicenza in the northeastern part of the country. It was a matter of days from when the Innocentis arrived in Vicenza to when the first cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, were reported in Italy. Italy, a country of more than 60 million people, went into a nationwide lockdown March 9 — people can only leave their residences if they need to go to work, shop for groceries or have medical needs, Innocenti said. Schools have been closed, events open to the public have been banned and religious services suspended, according to CNN. “They don’t want any non-essential movement right now,” Innocenti said of Italian officials. There are currently more than 74,000 cases of the disease in Italy with 7,505 deaths so far, according to the World Health Organization’s website. Italy is one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus, other than China, which has nearly 82,000 cases and 3,293 deaths. The United States ranks third in the world with more than 63,500 confirmed cases and 884 deaths, according to the WHO. Innocenti, 51, a former resident of Churchville, spoke to an Aegis reporter March 24 via Facebook video chat from the two-bedroom hotel room in Vicenza where she, her husband Robert and their 10-year-old daughter, Juliana, have been living since they arrived in January. “We’re making the best of it, just like everybody else,” she said of life during the national lockdown. “We’re going to get through this.” Life on lockdown Italian officials have placed strict limitations on where people can go. Restaurants and parks have been closed throughout the nation, and a number of food stands on U.S. military bases are closed, too. People are restricted to within 200 meters — about 650 feet — of their residences, although they can go beyond that boundary to certain locations such as post offices, grocery stores, pharmacies and news stands. Identification documents are required when traveling, according to Innocenti. She walks the family dog, an 8-month-old male Labrador retriever named Sawyer, making sure to stay within the 200-meter boundary outside the hotel. Juliana hangs out with her mother during the walks. “He’s our little break from everything, our diversion,” Innocenti said of the dog. When the family does go out in the community or on the Army post, they practice frequent hand washing and disinfecting. “Any time we go out, we have hand sanitizer with us,” Innocenti said. “We have hand wipes, we have Clorox wipes.” There are hand-washing stations in facilities on post still open to visitors such as the post exchange, commissary and post office. “When we get in the car, we clean our hands,” she said. 'When we get home, we wash." Innocenti has seen people wearing face masks when out and about, but she does not typically wear one as she would rather they be saved for health care workers. As of last week, the Innocentis and other hotel guests, many of them Americans, have stood outside in the evenings singing various songs, similar to people in other parts of Italy who stood on their balconies and played or sang opera. “The other people that are stuck here, it gives us a sense of unity,” she said. “We’ve all left our homes back in the United States.” She said the singing has helped “break up the monotony” and brought people together. “We’re hoping that, once this is all over, we’re going to have a big party,” Innocenti said. Family ‘jumped at the chance’ Innocenti grew up near Kalamazoo, Michigan, and is a veteran of the Navy. She spent 13 years in active-duty service and eight years in the naval reserves. She also has worked for the Department of the Navy, but became a stay-at-home parent after Juliana was born in 2009. Her family moved to Harford County in 2010, as her husband worked as a Army civilian employee at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Robert Innocenti retired in 2015, but he recently came out of retirement and started looking for work with the Army overseas. The opportunity came about to work in Vicenza, Italy, as the Army operates two facilities near the city, including Caserma Ederle, the home of the U.S. Army Garrison Italy, and Caserma Del Din. The latter was established in 2013 as the headquarters of the 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Airborne). “We jumped at the chance, couldn’t resist,” she said of the opportunity to move to Italy, a country she, her husband and daughter have visited on multiple occasions. Robert, who is assigned to Caserma Ederle, has been “teleworking” from the family’s room at the hotel, Melissa said. Juliana, who had been attending a Defense Department school on post, is now taking classes online via multiple Google platforms. Melissa continues to be a stay-at-home mom and joked that she is “earning my teaching degree” while supervising her daughter’s schooling. Innocenti said she loves the Italian lifestyle, which she described as “very family oriented,” and noted that people live at “just a more relaxed pace” compared to the U.S. She described Vicenza, which is between Verona and Venice, as “a very beautiful town.” The city is part of the Veneto region, and it dates back to the second century B.C. The city and multiple Palladian-style villas in the surrounding area became a UNESCO World Heritage site in the 1990s. The Palladian architectural style was developed by Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, who lived during the 1500s and studied classical Roman architecture. The design of a number of buildings in Vicenza, as well as villas outside the city, has been attributed to Palladio. Innocenti said the design of Vicenza is more spread out, compared to communities further south in the area of the nation’s capital, Rome, where houses are close together. “The buildings are just gorgeous,” she said of Vicenza. “The architecture is wonderful.” Juliana and her classmates were assigned a project on Palladio’s work while learning at home. They watched an online video about the architect and then used supplies they had on hand to create a drawing or build a model based on the Palladian style, Innocenti said. Online schooling Juliana, who attended Churchville Elementary School when her family lived in Harford County, has gone from her DOD school to learning at home since late February. The students have been taking their classes, including math, grammar, social studies, Italian language and customs, even “specials” such as art, music and physical education, online. Juliana’s class is about 30 students, and they connect with their teacher online, twice a week, in groups of four to five. Juliana can talk with her teacher, and her teacher with her, via Google Chat, and she can talk with her classmates. The technology has allowed Juliana to keep in touch with her peers during the lockdown, as “they just all know they can’t see anybody [in person] right now,” according to Innocenti. “It’s all working out; I’m thankful for that,” Innocenti said of the distance learning.

Two Harford nursing homes confirm more than 45 coronavirus cases, including two deaths, among residents and staff
.W
Two Harford County nursing homes have confirmed over 45 cases of coronavirus among residents and staff, the nursing homes’ announced in a statement. Cases at Forest Hill Health & Rehabilitation and Bel Air Health & Rehabilitation were first confirmed in mid-April and residents were quarantined, said Annaliese Impink, Executive Vice President and Chief Experience Officer of SavaSeniorCare Consulting LLC, in an email Wednesday. At the Forest Hill center, 19 residents and 16 staff have tested positive for the virus, and two residents have died, Impink said. Of the infected residents, 16 are being cared for at the center while one is in the hospital. The center had 111 residents as of Wednesday and employs 165 people. Ten residents and one staff member have tested positive at the Bel Air facility, though there have been no deaths there, Impink said. Nine residents are being cared for on-site and one is in the hospital. The Bel Air center housed 115 residents and employs 153 people. Staff at both centers were was asked to not work at other centers after the cases were first confirmed, Impink said, and rooms throughout the faculties are being “constantly” sanitized. “This is an insidious virus that is particularly devastating to the frail and elderly and medically compromised,” she said. The nursing homes’ Tuesday evening announcement of infections corresponded with an uptick in cases reported by the Maryland Health Department in ZIP codes where the facilities were located. Cases reported in Forest Hill’s ZIP code nearly doubled from 25 to 47 in the 24-hour reporting period from Tuesday to Wednesday. The Bel Air North ZIP code of 21014 saw an increase of 10 cases, putting it up to 42 Wednesday. The coronavirus has rocked nursing homes from Carroll County to Baltimore, though Maryland Health officials have not provided a list of infected nursing homes, even to administrators and staff. Still, the virus’ presence has been confirmed in two-thirds of the state’s 226 nursing home facilities. Both the Forest Hill and Bel Air centers are taking steps to protect their residents, including providing adequate personal protective equipment, screening staff members for respiratory illness before their shifts, restricting visitation and following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines, according to the statement. Impink did not know how the coronavirus got into the centers, which have restricted visitation per CDC guidelines since early March. Residents are allowed to leave the facilities “for medical appointments, dialysis treatment, and required hospitalization,” she said. The centers are being provided more electronic devices like iPads to allow residents to communicate with their families remotely, according to the statement. They are also working with the state and local health department to curb the spread of the virus, according to the statement. SavaSeniorCare Administrative Services LLC, the company that issued Tuesday’s statement, provides back-office services to centers, Impink said, and is based in Atlanta. "We recognize the especially vulnerable nature of those we serve and the staff who care for them,” Impink said in the statement. “We are dedicated to protecting our residents and our employees above all else, and are doing everything in our power to keep those in our Center safe.”

Baltimore’s Metropolitan Transition Center on full quarantine after corrections officer tests positive for coronavirus
.W
The Metropolitan Transition Center in Baltimore is on full quarantine after a corrections officer tested positive for the new coronavirus, Maryland’s prison system confirmed late Wednesday. Details were not provided. The disclosure came two days after the prison system said it had its first confirmed cases of COVID-19, with an inmate and two non-corrections contract staff testing positive at facilities in Jessup and Baltimore. Because prison officials never disclosed at which Baltimore facility the previous positive test occurred, it was unclear whether the Metropolitan Transition Center case was a new facility to be impacted. But the positive test led to the new step of quarantining the entire facility. “Due to the layout of this particular facility (the former MD State Pen, now a pretrial detention center), the decision was made to quarantine the entire population for their safety rather than designate a particular housing space,” said Mark Vernarelli, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. Defense attorneys and advocates for prisoners have been calling on Gov. Larry Hogan to release eligible detainees amid the nation’s coronavirus crisis, saying that positive cases could spread quickly and that the system is not equipped to handle such an outbreak. Hogan has resisted the calls so far.

Maryland’s highest court issues sweeping order to help prevent spread of coronavirus in juvenile detention centers 
.W
The state’s highest court took sweeping actions late Monday to protect juveniles already behind bars and to keep more youth from being detained unless absolutely necessary, the state justice system’s strongest response yet to the growing threat of the coronavirus. Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Ellen Barbera ordered judges handling juvenile cases to determine whether jailing the juvenile would cause “serious health risks to the juvenile, other detained individuals, staff or the community” before locking them up. If a juvenile is showing any symptoms of COVID-19 or has tested positive for the virus, Barbera said, it should be taken into consideration before detaining them. Barbera also ordered judges to put in writing all of their reasons for detaining a juvenile offender. “Judges responsible for handling juvenile matters are encouraged ... to limit detention or commitment, unless necessary to protect the safety of that juvenile respondent or the safety of others, in or to Maryland juvenile detention and treatment facilities,” Barbera said. The order comes as the state is reporting a growing number of coronavirus cases in adult and juvenile detention facilities. Barbera urged judges to consider whether the "Department of Juvenile Services has notified the court of a viable alternative plan for detention or commitment ... and whether the juvenile has family or a placement resource available to meet basic food, housing, and health needs.” Amy Fettig, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project, said the court’s order is a step in the right direction but doesn’t go far enough. “They really need more decisive action I would say because the need for the children and the community is urgent,” Fettig said. “There is no reason to hold any kid in that facility that is going to be released within 90 days. Release those kids now.” Barbera said judges also should consider whether facilities are able to handle medical issues, separate or related to COVID-19, and if they can properly feed and house the youth. Judges also are encouraged to work with juvenile justice system workers to identify kids already committed or detained who could be released to “protect the health of at-risk juveniles during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis with careful regard for the safety of victims and communities in general.” If a juvenile is detained, Barbera said, a hearing will be conducted no less than every 14 days to determine whether detention continues to be necessary. Judges hearing juvenile matters must “expeditiously” issue a ruling or schedule a remote hearing if requested by the department or an attorney for the juvenile. Judges also can schedule quick hearings on their own initiative, she said.

Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot is defending his chief of staff as the state Republican Party calls for him to be fired over a Facebook post that mocked people who’ve defied stay-at-home orders governors imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Party Chairman Dirk Haire erupted Saturday night in criticism of Len Foxwell over an April 13 post in which Foxwell suggested people who resist social distancing measures be locked in a warehouse to “let Darwin work his magic.” “Let’s lure them into a big, big warehouse (we’ll call it something real classy to suit their refined sensibilities, like ‘American MAGA Platinum Palace'),” Foxwell wrote, according to a screen shot Haire distributed to state Republicans and the media. Providing food, cigarettes and alcohol, Foxwell said, “Get them in, bar the door and then let Darwin work his magic.” Haire suggested the post advocated for “the genocide of President [Donald] Trump’s supporters” and called it “extraordinarily inappropriate and representative of a base and destructive mindset.” In a statement, Foxwell said his post did not refer to all Trump supporters, but followers of what the Southern Poverty Law Center calls the antigovernment “Patriot" movement. He said it was linked to an NPR story about a Patriot group and far-right elected officials in Idaho calling for rebelling against stay-at-home orders. Foxwell wrote that it “had nothing to do with rank-and-file Trump supporters — notwithstanding my deep, searing distaste for the president’s politics and his catastrophic mismanagement of this crisis.” He added in a follow-up Facebook post Saturday that, “Nor, obviously, did I ever express hope that someone would die. Any suggestions to the contrary are simply, absolutely false.” Haire suggested Franchot, a Democrat who frequently spars with members of his own party, fire Foxwell. “As an announced candidate for governor of Maryland in 2022, I expect you to do the right thing and terminate Mr. Foxwell’s employment as your chief of staff,” Haire wrote to Franchot. “If you do not, you can be certain that Mr. Foxwell’s views, and your refusal to repudiate such views, will be made aware to every voter in Maryland during the 2022 campaign by the Maryland Republican Party.” Franchot defended Foxwell’s comments as “satirical” in a Facebook post of his own Saturday. The comptroller also noted Foxwell made them on his personal Facebook account. The post from Monday was not on Foxwell’s Facebook page by the weekend. “I remain 100% supportive of Len Foxwell and the exceptional work he continues to do for me and for the people of Maryland,” Franchot wrote. “He is an exceptional public servant, a dear family friend, and I look forward to his continued service as my chief of staff for years to come.” Foxwell earned $181,000 last year, according to a state salary database. On Sunday, Haire responded to Franchot’s statement by telling party supporters in an email: “The Maryland Republican Party will be ready to deploy significant amounts of advertising and communications dollars in the 2022 Governor’s race to make sure every Maryland voter is aware of Comptroller Franchot’s views.” In Maryland, 486 people had died of COVID-19 as of Sunday. The state had 12,830 cases of the disease. Republican Gov. Larry Hogan issued a stay-at-home order March 30, and ordered the wearing of masks in stores and on public transit as of Saturday. He has said he will detail further this week the state’s plans for how and when to reopen its economy, schools and houses of worship. But he has emphasized that the state has not reached its peak of cases and must meet standards for testing for the disease and tracing people exposed to it, have capacity at hospitals to handle a surge of patients, and have sufficient personal protective equipment. Opposition to Hogan’s approach was apparent Saturday in Annapolis, when hundreds of people protested the restrictions that have closed all but essential businesses. Also Saturday, Republican state delegates wrote to Hogan, asking him to consider a regional approach to relaxing restrictions so businesses can reopen. And in his message to state party supporters, Haire thanked them for their “support of the GOP as we push to open the state as soon as possible.”

Federal prisons ignore court order to release woman from Baltimore halfway house amid coronavirus concerns
.W
The defendant served 11 months in a federal prison, and in January was transferred to an East Baltimore halfway house. With her final release date projected for late April, her attorney asked a judge to release her to home confinement and avoid potential exposure to COVID-19. The federal judge agreed, signing an order on March 20. But a week later, the Bureau of Prisons has not released Erica Cook, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office instead filed motions in her case and others like it arguing judges have no authority to change the conditions of a defendant’s confinement. Since the original motion was filed, a resident of the Volunteers of America facility where she and more than 120 others are being held was sent to a hospital and then sent home to quarantine, raising concerns that the virus could be circulating already. “Given all the independent and legitimate bases on which the Court can and should grant Ms. Cook’s release from the VOA, there is no reason to risk her life for purposes of honoring a (hopefully) soon-to-be-defunct practice of opposing release to home confinement for residents currently living in dangerous halfway houses,” Cook’s attorney Brian Stekloff wrote in an emergency motion filed Friday. “Ms. Cook requests that the Court act now.” The case is one of a slew of challenges coming before the courts as lawyers and advocacy organizations seek to free prisoners from facilities where they fear an outbreak of coronavirus would spread rapidly. U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Thursday directed the Bureau of Prisons to increase the use of home confinement among older inmates with underlying conditions. As of Friday, 14 inmates and 13 staff members have tested positive for COVID-19 in federal facilities. The Volunteers of America residential re-entry facility has not had any residents test positive for COVID-19, said Candace Vanderwater, chief operating officer for Volunteers for America. But it has 12 people who after hospital visits were sent home on “medical furlough” to quarantine. “Medical personnel are making the decision on which tests are occurring,” Vanderwater said. “Some are being tested for COVID-19, some are being tested for flu, some for pneumonia.” None of the medical furloughs have returned from quarantine yet, though some are scheduled to next month. In the meantime, the facility is allowing residents to leave for jobs or medical appointments, but otherwise restricting movement. “We’re just trying to keep folks calm, make sure we are following all of the social distance guidelines and the guidelines we’re getting from the CDC,” Vanderwater said. “We’re all very nervous and making sure we’re doing all of the proper procedures.” Cook’s attorney accused VOA of failing to immediately implement such measures, leading to “dangerous and deteriorating conditions,” and says BOP’s refusal to release her is a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Cook was one of 80 people charged in federal racketeering case related to corruption at the Eastern Correctional Institution, where she was a corrections officer. Cook pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy in 2017. After her eventual release she will remain on supervision for three years. Defendants at residential re-rentry centers are at the “tail-end of their sentences” said Jim Wyda, the top federal public defender in Maryland. “Many of them are eligible for home detention at this point. Those who aren’t are weeks away,” Wyda said. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has fought, and judges have agreed, against releasing pretrial detainees, including a paraplegic man facing drug trafficking charges whose attorneys said he is particularly susceptible to illness. In that case, U.S. Magistrate Judge J. Mark Coulson ruled that his underlying health conditions “create an enhanced risk whether or not he is detained” and that there was no evidence that protocols in place at the Chesapeake Detention Facility have been inadequate. But Wyda said judges were agreeing to issue orders to transfer defendants from halfway houses to home confinement to finish the remainder of their sentences. “From a public health perspective it was the right thing to do,” Wyda said. “But the BOP seems to be stubbornly sticking to the practices they always do, and not making changes, and it’s putting everyone at risk.” Vandwater declined to comment on whether she believes the BOP should honor the court orders, but confirmed that her organization has not been told to release anyone. She said the conflict has arisen in the past, prior to COVID-19 concerns. Should the defendants be released, they face separate challenges of where to go. Wyda said his staff have scrambled to help people without a home waiting for them to find homeless programs.

Baltimore suspends Harbor Connector commuting services to defend against coronavirus spread
.W
Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young and the Baltimore City Department of Transportation announced Saturday the city will suspend Harbor Connector maritime commuting services beginning Monday. The suspension comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home executive order. “This change further encourages residents to stay at home as much as possible, and to practice social distancing when commuting,” Young said in a statement. “I support Director Steve Sharkey’s decision, and know he and his team are working hard to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.” The Harbor Connector has already seen a 90% decrease in ridership since March 16, according to the announcement.

Tracking coronavirus around the world from 725 West Baltimore Street | COMMENTARY
.W
An old complaint about the weather in central Maryland and the southern edge of the mid-Atlantic is that we don’t get much of a spring here. In many years, the climate seems to jump from winter to July, and going from zero to 90 in three weeks makes a lot of people cranky. But, given pandemic and national emergency, we might want to refrain from complaining about the lack of a long, cool spring and root for sudden summer. And while President Donald Trump continues to make misleading statements about the coronavirus and the botched federal response to its emergence, he might be correct about one thing: Warming temperatures could make it “go away,” at least for a time. A just-published analysis from virologists in Baltimore suggests a possible seasonality to the coronavirus. Researchers at 725 West Baltimore Street, home of the Institute of Human Virology, part of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, wanted to know if climate could be a factor in the community spread of coronavirus. So they tracked it around the globe. During the first three months of the outbreak, they found COVID-19 spreading under specific conditions and along a consistent path, a kind of coronavirus zone. Outbreaks have been reported in urban areas with average winter temperatures of 41 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit and average humidity of 47 to 79 percent. “There is a similarity in the measures of average temperature [and humidity] in the affected cities and known laboratory conditions that are conducive to coronavirus survival,” the study found. In addition, the Maryland researchers noticed that the epicenters of the disease were roughly along the same latitude, in an east-west pattern — China (specifically Wuhan, the source of the outbreak), South Korea, Japan, Washington state (specifically Seattle), northern California and Iran. Many respiratory viruses are considered seasonal and appear to thrive in temperate climates. The team at the IHV started to see another characteristic of the coronavirus transmission — it did not appear to occur to a significant degree in tropical countries south of China nor in cold countries such as Russia. “The seven major outbreaks we studied as of early March occurred in regions with a very similar latitude and strikingly similar temperature and humidity pattern,” says the leader of the study, Dr. Mohammad Sajadi, an associate professor at the IHV and a member of the Global Virus Network. “To us, this was suggestive that temperature and humidity could hold a key role in transmission, and as with similar respiratory viruses, this one was potentially seasonal. “In temperate areas, respiratory viruses typically come on in the fall and/or winter, and diminish significantly by spring and/or summer. We predicted certain areas to be at the highest risk right now and in the near future.” Using weather data from 2019, and looking at areas with similar temperature and latitude, Sajadi’s team predicted that COVID-19 could affect areas just north of the current areas at risk. “These could include (from east to west) Manchuria, Central Asia, the Caucuses, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, the British Isles, the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, and British Columbia,” the study said. “However, this simplified analysis does not take into account the effect of warming temperatures. The marked drop in cases in Wuhan could well be linked to corresponding recent rising temperatures there.” This is why I say people in Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic generally, if not the Northeast, including New England, might root for a fast run to summer. A long, slow spring would bring the temperate climate that appears to be conducive to the spread of the disease. A purpose of the IHV study was to build a weather model that might help predict the path and duration of the virus. “For many,” the study notes, “the biggest concern [with coronavirus] is not how large the problem but what will happen in the coming months and which areas and populations are most at risk.” Having some understanding of that, Sajadi’s team said, “allows for concentration of public health efforts on surveillance and containment.” The study notes that, “although the current correlations with latitude and temperature seem strong, a direct causation has not been proven and predictions in the near term are speculative and have to be considered with extreme caution.” And I hasten to add that hoping for virus-dissipating weather — wishing coronavirus will just “go away” when the peonies bloom — is no substitute for the important local actions being taken to slow transmission in Maryland and other states. Given the nation’s poor start in dealing with the novel virus and the woeful lack of testing for the disease, the measures we’ve been asked to embrace make the most sense. “I know everyone in Maryland would like to know when there might be a decrease in cases,” says Sajadi. “What we proposed was a prediction based on the evidence we had at hand, and only time will tell if we were correct. For now, the best thing to do is to take the advice of public health officials in limiting the spread of this virus.” Wash your hands frequently or, as I recently heard it stated: “Wash your hands as if they’re covered in Old Bay and you need to put your contacts in.” Work from home if you can. Avoid crowds. Look out for your neighbors, but keep your distance. Root for summer.

Baltimore City Public Schools confirm first known case of coronavirus, an employee at Cherry Hill Elementary/Middle 
.W
A Baltimore City Public School System employee tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Sunday, according to officials. This is the first confirmed case of coronavirus among Baltimore City schools. According to city schools, the Baltimore City Health Department said the employee, who works at Cherry Hill Elementary/Middle School, contracted the virus three days after schools were closed March 16. The individual has not been on site since then, officials said. The school did not name the employee because of confidentiality reasons but said the employee has not been distributing learning packets or emergency meals. Though city schools remain suspended, the school system said it is following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by continuing to thoroughly clean and sanitize all schools. Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said in a statement he is “confident” that the school system will learn as much as it can from this case. “I am confident in Baltimore City Schools CEO Dr. Sonja Santelises and her team and the efforts they have engaged in with the Health Department to learn as much about this case as possible, and ensure all appropriate guidance is followed," Young said. In Maryland there are 1,239 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 15 people have died, according to officials.

‘Nobody should die alone’: Towson nurse provides care, support for coronavirus patients, hospital staff
.W
In her 23 years working as a registered nurse at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson, Cate O’Connor-Devlin, 55, has never experienced what she has had to endure over the past two months. From dressing up in personal protective equipment to incessant hand-washing and sanitizing, she said going to work is both a burden and a privilege. As one of the many nurses on the front lines fighting the global coronavirus pandemic, O’Connor-Devlin persists in her commitment to GBMC’s mission: “to provide the care she would want for her own loved ones.” On April 23, John Chessare, president and CEO of GBMC, announced 15 patients had tested positive for COVID-19 and nine were awaiting test results. Although there has been a significant flattening in the number of cases, he said, the team at GBMC must remain vigilant. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, the team has adhered to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, he said. “We, too, have done social distancing when we are out in the hallways or at meetings. We stay 6 feet away from each other,” he said. “We all wear facial coverings and are doing frequent hand-washing.” He is grateful for the dedication of the team at GBMC and the work they have done during this time, he said. “They are heroes,” Chessare said. “They are putting themselves at risk to save others.” As performance improvement and patient experience administrator, it is O’Connor-Devlin’s job to ensure a positive experience for patients and their loved ones. Since the coronavirus outbreak, that includes taking the necessary precautions to maintain their health and safety. Despite having worked with a number of patients, she said it has been a different experience working with COVID-19 patients. “The [patients] with COVID-19 are scared,” she said. “Their families are scared to visit them.” Tending to those patients requires personal protective equipment, making it harder to connect, she said. “[Our] voices are muffled and [patients] can’t see people’s faces,” she said. “There is a constant barrier between holding someone’s hand or [seeing] someone’s face for comfort.” Due to social distancing guidelines, visitors are no longer allowed in the hospital and communication must be coordinated through video chat. The hardest part of her job, O’Connor-Devlin said, has been standing in for family members who could not be in the room to say their final goodbye. “I have been in the room with the young family that has had to say goodbye to their dad,” she said. “I [serve] as the bridge between the electronic and the personal.” Although her experience does not compare to those serving at larger cosmopolitan hospitals, she said it is never easy. “We are all human and nobody should die alone,” she said. Along with looking after her patients, she also has looked after colleagues. To address the shortage of personal protective equipment, she created a “hub” that provides the team all-day access to supplies. Sharon Rossi, director of peri-operative services at GBMC, said O’Connor-Devlin has demonstrated strength during this time. “[O’Connor-Devlin] is resilient,” she said. “She really has been at the helm of many of the key operations during this COVID-19 experience.” While working together during this pandemic, she and O’Connor-Devlin have been able to support one another. “[O’Connor-Devlin] and I have a great relationship and we are true colleagues,” she said. “[We] free flow ideas and we have the same goal in mind to take care of our patients and staff.” Rhonda Wyskiel, director of performance improvement at GBMC who has supervised O’Connor-Devlin for the past two years, shared her view. “Cate is one of the strongest people that I’ve worked with in a very long time,” she said. “She is strong in her values, and she is strong in her execution in what she needs to accomplish, and she is strong in her connections with patients and families and staff.” Wyskiel said she and O’Connor-Devlin have been able to confide in one another during this time. “There have been a number of times where there is so much uncertainty about what the end of the day or the next day is going to look like,” she said. “I can tell [O’Connor-Devlin] when I’m scared or afraid, and she has a great way of listening and acknowledging and helping me to remind myself that I am resilient and I have endurance.” In addition to receiving support from her colleagues, O’Connor-Devlin said the team has seen encouragement from the community. Some have placed signs on their front lawns, while others have offered to baby-sit or buy groceries. “The community has been amazing,” she said. “There has been a constant stream of food and fabric masks.” While appreciating the gratitude of the community, she knows it is her responsibility to keep them safe. “I want people to know that I am doing my job,” she said. “I am here to take care of people, and we are doing it to the best of our ability.” Not only has she been able to rely on the support of the community, but also on the support of her family. “[My] husband is my rock,” she said. “Every night when I go home, he is waiting and makes me my dinner and tea and works out with me and takes care of me.” Although it is too early to tell, O’Connor-Devlin said she believes this pandemic will change the way health care is practiced in the years to come. Despite an unforeseeable future, she is grateful to be a part of the fight. “I am so honored to be a nurse, and the fact that this pandemic has given me the opportunity to help families in any small way is humbling for me,” she said.

Nursing homes account for more than half of Maryland’s coronavirus deaths. Some want the state to do more.
.W
Nursing homes in Maryland account for just over half of the deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to new data released Tuesday evening by the Maryland Department of Health. There were 4,406 coronavirus cases in the state’s nursing homes Tuesday, and the facilities account for 471 of Maryland’s coronavirus deaths. That means more than one in five of the state’s 20,113 confirmed cases as of Tuesday are attributed to nursing homes. The state’s total confirmed deaths related to the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus stand at 929. As Maryland released the data after repeated public calls for the information, nursing homes already were demanding more action to protect their vulnerable residents. The extent of the outbreak in nursing homes suggests the facilities should get more of the supplies, testing and attention that have gone to hospitals, said Kevin Heffner, CEO of the LifeSpan Network, which represents long-term care facilities in Maryland and Washington. “If anyone takes an honest look at the data that exists about where the COVID patients are, it’s overwhelming that they’re in nursing homes, they’re in assisted living,” he said. “It’s really time to start devoting some of the state’s resources to nursing homes. That’s where the need is." In the first weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, state officials rushed to prepare hospitals and ready space for an eventual influx of COVID-19 patients. But nursing home industry leaders say that, while they have gotten some help from state and local health officials, they haven’t received the same level of attention and resources as hospitals even as cases and deaths in their facilities have mounted. For weeks, Maryland had resisted requests for detailed breakdowns of coronavirus case counts and death tolls at nursing homes, and had even directed local health departments to stop providing information on specific outbreaks that had been released in spurts. The state told The Baltimore Sun that disclosing a list of nursing homes dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks would serve “no public health purpose.” But state officials reversed course Monday, saying they decided that public demand for the information overrides what they called legal concerns over patient privacy. The state health department said it would begin posting data related to COVID-19 cases and deaths associated with nursing homes, assisted living centers and other “congregate living” facilities this week. Until Tuesday, the state was among 15 in the country not reporting any specifics on nursing home cases or deaths, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The data revealed many large outbreaks around the state, including several that have been reported publicly and have continued to expand. The death toll at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy has reached 29, with 129 positive tests. At FutureCare Lochearn in Baltimore, where a rare effort by the operator to test all residents and staff revealed 170 infections earlier this month, the case count has surged to 220, and 10 people have died. At Genesis Loch Raven, seven people have died out of more than 80 who tested positive there. Before the state released the data, it was already clear that there was a significant toll in nursing homes. People aged 70 and older account for nearly two-thirds of the 929 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the state as of Tuesday. Data that county officials shared with The Sun shows that nursing home residents represent 54% of coronavirus-related deaths in Howard County, 67% in Baltimore County, 71% in Anne Arundel County and more than 90% in Carroll County. Across the country, similar clusters of nursing home deaths are being reported. More than 10,000 residents of long-term care have died of COVID-19 in 23 states that are reporting those numbers, according to the foundation. That represents 27% of coronavirus deaths in those states. Maryland officials have raised alarm about the potential dangers of coronavirus spread in nursing homes since early on in the pandemic, after concerns about a major outbreak at a nursing facility near Seattle. Actions to protect nursing homes were among Gov. Larry Hogan’s first executive orders under a declared state of emergency last month. He demanded facilities restrict visitor access to reduce potential exposure to residents in early March. When it became clear that staff were bringing the virus in earlier this month, he ordered all staff to begin wearing masks, gowns and face shields when interacting with nursing home residents and patients. And as infections spread and the death toll rose at facilities such as Pleasant View in Mount Airy, the state began launching what Hogan called “strike teams” to help nursing home administrators triage outbreaks. But nursing home administrators say they nonetheless still are struggling to keep up with the pace of infection. They say those teams provide some help with protective equipment and testing, but not enough to help the facilities manage outbreaks in the long term. They face shortages in staffing, exacerbated by illness and fears about the virus; in space for quarantining COVID-positive residents from others; and in protective supplies for staff to comply with Hogan’s order. While they have received small quantities of protective equipment from a national emergency stockpile, they otherwise have had to scramble for supplies through private vendors and other organizations. Many hospitals, on the other hand, have established COVID-19 units with dedicated staff, reducing the risk of those caregivers spreading the virus to COVID-negative patients. And, apart from emergency care, they are otherwise keeping beds free by canceling elective procedures. Bob Atlas, CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association, said it’s “not accurate” to suggest there has not been a coronavirus-related surge in patients at the state’s acute and emergency care centers. About 80% of 7,500 hospital beds across the state are occupied, and a quarter of those patients have tested positive for COVID-19, a fraction Atlas said is growing. Hospitals have readied space for an additional 2,000 beds, and Atlas said that includes enough capacity for any coronavirus patients in nursing homes whose condition requires a higher level of care. But they also are facing similar protective equipment shortages and staffing issues. Hospitals also face an economic crisis as elective procedures remain on hold and people avoid care out of coronavirus fears. Emergency room traffic, even, is at a third of its normal level, and the state association predicts state hospitals’ revenue will decline by 20% in the three months from April through June, by $1 billion collectively. The reduced business already has forced layoffs and other cuts, including the furlough of 1,000 employees at Anne Arundel Medical Center last week. But nursing home industry leaders say, given that the coronavirus is hitting their facilities hardest, some hospital resources should be shifted. “If hospitals are laying off people, the need doesn’t exist there, and meanwhile in nursing homes and assisted living, it’s exploded and we can’t get the resources we need,” Heffner said. “It’s all been devoted to hospitals.” Heffner said nursing homes are pressing the state to do more testing, including of all nursing home patients and staff and any patient being transferred from a hospital to a nursing home. And they are asking for more help building inventories of protective equipment. Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said meeting with nursing home industry officials, including Heffner, was “one of the first things the governor did after declaring a state of emergency." That meeting, he said, was followed by “a wave of aggressive actions.” “Governor Hogan has and will continue to take whatever actions are necessary to protect Marylanders in long-term and continuing care facilities," Ricci said. Some state lawmakers are meanwhile taking a closer look at nursing homes’ concerns. Several members of the House of Delegates met by teleconference with nursing home industry leaders Tuesday to discuss problems and potential solutions. Del. Joseline A. Peña-Melnyk, a Democrat who represents Anne Arundel and Prince George’s counties, was among them, and said lawmakers left the briefing concerned that some facilities are turning away the state’s strike teams. She said she wants Hogan to amend his executive order to require facilities to accept the teams. “Those are the most vulnerable people,” Peña-Melnyk said. “We should be testing them frequently, stabilizing those places and providing them with PPE. The virus is attacking people who are medically compromised with preexisting conditions. It’s attacking black and brown people who have disparities in our communities. We need to do more for the most vulnerable in particular.” Sen. Paul Pinsky, a Prince George’s County Democrat who was not on the teleconference, said he thinks that with such a crisis in so many nursing homes, the state should do whatever it can to help them, including expanded testing and more space to quarantine patients. “We don’t want more people to die; that’s as simple as it is," Pinsky said. "If we need more isolation, that’s what we need.” Baltimore Sun reporters Luke Broadwater and Pamela Wood contributed to this article.

Ocean City to reopen beaches, boardwalk this weekend, as resort town sees first coronavirus cases 
.W
Ocean City will reopen its beaches and boardwalk to the general public Saturday — a move town officials say will provide more recreation space but leaves some concerned that out-of-town visitors could defy Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home order and spread the coronavirus. The announcement of the reopening decision comes as state health officials confirmed the first nine cases of coronavirus in Ocean City in the past 24 hours, according to the state’s newest ZIP code data released Tuesday. Fewer than one in every 1,000 residents in the 21842 ZIP code encompassing Ocean City are confirmed infected. Mayor Rick Meehan insists the resort town’s actions will not violate Hogan’s executive order allowing for essential travel only, saying during a news conference Tuesday that the town is “not asking anyone to supersede the travel restrictions that are in place.” Worcester County Health Department spokesman Travis Brown declined to say if the agency supported re-opening the beaches and boardwalk. “We want to reiterate that everyone in Maryland needs to be following all Executive Orders from Governor Larry Hogan, including social distancing, wearing masks in retail establishments and on public transportation, avoiding crowds and avoiding non-essential travel,” Brown said in an email. Brown deferred comment to Ocean City officials about the new COVID-19 cases in the town. Tuesday evening, an Ocean City spokeswoman referred questions back to the health department. Earlier, Meehan said that the town’s police force will not be directed to look for out-of-town residents and that “everyone has to make their own personal decision.” “There will be no police officers patrolling for license plates,” Meehan said. “That’s not going to be the case here in Ocean City.” The City Council unanimously passed a resolution Monday allowing for the beaches to reopen. While the town has kept businesses and public spaces closed during the pandemic, some council members have voiced concerns about the damage the shutdown had done to area businesses in recent weeks. Meehan said that Monday’s resolution was passed, in part, to give people “more opportunities to go outside, enjoy the fresh air, while still adhering” to social distancing guidelines. In a joint statement with Ocean City communications manager Jessica Waters, Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci agreed that reopening the town’s beaches is a way to allow residents to be outside more. “This is a way to give nearby residents more opportunities to get outside and enjoy fresh air, while still adhering to social distancing guidelines and gathering limits," the statement said. "The governor’s stay-at-home order remains in effect.” But Ricci confirmed it would go against the governor’s orders if people were driving from outside the area to walk the beaches or boardwalk. City Council Secretary Mary Knight told The Baltimore Sun Monday evening that Ocean City “wanted to take this baby step to give people hope and allow them to see that there is light at the end of tunnel.” But the secretary added that Ocean City would welcome out-of-towners who wanted to spend the day walking the beach as long as they adhered to the social distance guidelines. Masks will not be mandatory. Hotels and most boardwalk shops will remain closed, Knight said, with the exception of a few carryout places, so it would be hard for anyone to stay more than a day. Susan Jones, executive director of the Ocean City Hotel-Motel-Restaurant Association, said only seven out of 115 hotels are currently accepting lodgers, and only those considered essential personnel during the pandemic. “We’re not closing it to day-trippers,” Knight said. “If they want to come down and spend the day at the beach and walk the boardwalk, there’s no problem with that. It’s Mother’s Day this weekend, it might be nice to take your mom somewhere.” But when asked whether allowing non-Ocean City residents to walk the beaches would violate Hogan’s executive order, which allows for essential travel only, Knight declined to comment. “I trust the mayor,” she said. Ocean City’s decision comes as other states have reopened beaches and parks during the pandemic, which has drawn criticism that officials are rushing to lift social distancing restrictions while confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths are still climbing. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis began allowing beaches to reopen late last month, the city of Miami Beach shut down a popular park Monday after the city’s police department said nearly 7,800 people violated social distancing measures by either not wearing masks or not maintaining six feet of distance between people. Donna Greenwood, a 76-year-old Ocean City resident, said she thinks the announcement is “going to create a huge influx of people” visiting the shore. She added that she’s already seen an increase of visitors as the weather has warmed up. “If it were only [for] people from the Ocean City area ... it would be a good decision,” she said. “I just don’t think they’re going to social distance.” She said she’s also concerned about residents from nearby Wicomico County and Sussex County, Delaware, potentially bringing the virus to Worcester County, which has 81 confirmed COVID-19 cases compared to 500 cases in Wicomico County and 2,520 cases in Sussex County, as of Tuesday. Hogan said last week that 262 poultry workers in the state had been infected with COVID-19 and that outbreaks had been identified in two processing plants in Sussex County. “If you’re having people come from areas that have so many cases of the COVID-19 virus ... I think it might be a little sketchy,” Greenwood said. Knight, the City Council secretary, said she is not worried about out-of-town residents crowding Ocean City this weekend because temperatures are supposed to be cooler. “It’s supposed to be 55 and cloudy this weekend,” she said. “God help 'em if that’s what people want to do.”

At least 6 Maryland nursing homes have 100 coronavirus cases, as data shows virus spreading through many facilities
.W
New data released by Maryland shows the coronavirus has spread throughout many of the state’s nursing homes, in some cases infecting most residents and many staffers, and killing more than 500 people. At least six nursing homes have more than 100 cases of the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus, counting both infected patients and staffers, according to the data published online Tuesday evening by the state health department. Those nursing homes include FutureCare Lochearn in Baltimore, SagePoint Nursing and Rehabilitation in Southern Maryland, Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, Genesis Health Care’s Ballenger Creek Center in Frederick, Ellicott City Healthcare Center and FutureCare Old Court in Randallstown. The caseloads mean the virus has infected the majority of residents in many facilities. For example, there are 154 infections reported among residents at the Lochearn center, which has capacity for 200 residents. At SagePoint in Charles County’s La Plata, 97 residents have tested positive in a facility with space for 170. The state released new data Wednesday breaking down nursing home cases and deaths by residents and workers. It showed 508 resident deaths and eight nursing home worker deaths statewide. The coronavirus has been deadliest in Maryland at SagePoint, where 34 residents and one employee have died, and Pleasant View, where the death toll is at least one staffer and 28 residents. Pleasant View had 95 residents at the time of the outbreak. The next highest death toll is at ManorCare Silver Spring, which has 16 resident deaths from 58 cases. Administrators at several of the nursing homes with the largest outbreaks said those numbers reflect widespread testing that so far has been hard for most facilities to access. Many nursing homes have been unable to test residents and staff who aren’t showing symptoms associated with COVID-19, the infection the coronavirus causes — but that is set to change after Gov. Larry Hogan on Wednesday ordered universal testing for the facilities. “When you test residents, you’re going to get more cases," said Fred Stratmann, a spokesman for CommuniCare, a company whose Baltimore-area nursing homes include Ellicott City Healthcare Center and Westminster Healthcare Center in Carroll County. CommuniCare’s Ellicott City facility has had 118 cases and 10 resident deaths, while the Westminster site has 54 cases and two resident deaths. The state’s nursing home administrators say they have been following a host of recommendations from state and federal health officials, including restricting visitor access since mid-March, requiring staff to wear extensive personal protective equipment, and testing staff and patients as much as they can. Some described going beyond health experts’ recommendations by separating the laundry of COVID-negative and -positive residents and making runs to Costco rather than allowing vending machine workers into their buildings. But the data show the virus continued to spread. “This is not the flu," said Holly O’Shea, a spokeswoman for FutureCare. That company conducted widespread testing across many of its 15 facilities around the Baltimore region, including at Lochearn, where testing revealed 170 infections two weeks ago. Several other of the company’s facilities are hard hit, including FutureCare Chesapeake in Arnold, which has had 114 cases and 13 deaths, and FutureCare Old Court in Randallstown, which has had 109 cases and nine deaths, including one employee. O’Shea said FutureCare has been working to adapt as more is learned about the virus’ spread. But the data show much is left to be understood. “What is it about this virus that, notwithstanding all the interventions we have in place, it’s so easily transmitted?” she said. “What is the key to cracking this virus’ code so it is stopped?" Officials at SagePoint said they tested all of the Charles County facility’s residents for coronavirus April 6 and got the results showing 79 cases four days later. They did not provide a timeline of when deaths now approaching three dozen occurred, however. “We believe we have saved lives because of what we did,” SagePoint said in a statement that also emphasized the facility received “little support” from county and state agencies. “It is important to remember that this happened TO our facility. It is not something that WE caused,” the statement continued. “It’s something that happened TO us. And we have done our very best to manage the situation.” Before Hogan’s announcement of expanded testing Wednesday, a group representing 14,000 nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other elderly care centers nationwide joined calls for expanded and priority testing for those communities. More test results could help nursing homes understand how many residents and staff could be carrying the virus without symptoms, but contagious and putting patients at risk, the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living said. The group also called for emergency funding for nursing homes to fight the pandemic, echoing concerns raised in Maryland. “Our industry has been sounding the alarm for weeks and weeks, but we have largely been forgotten by the public health sector," said Mark Parkinson, the group’s CEO, in a statement. "If we are not made a top priority, this situation will get worse with the most vulnerable in our society being lost.” Now that nursing home testing appears set to increase, it is raising concerns about even more difficulty maintaining staffing levels at the facilities. Any employees who test positive must be “immediately discharged into isolation,” said Hogan, adding that nursing homes must now develop “emergency surge staffing plans” to ensure patients can be cared for. The data shows large numbers of infections among staff at many facilities, as well: 66 at FutureCare Lochearn, 43 at FutureCare Chesapeake in Arnold and 39 at Genesis’ Ballenger Creek. Another initiative Hogan launched Wednesday could help facilities manage those shortages by sending 260 registered nurses and nursing aides to nursing homes dealing with outbreaks, through a Maryland Department of Health contract with the Allegis Group, a staffing agency, and the Maryland Hospital Association. But if large numbers of staff test positive, it would exacerbate common staffing challenges that have only intensified during the pandemic. “It would make it very difficult for us to meet staffing requirements if 20 percent of our workforce is an asymptomatic carrier who is unable to work,” CommuniCare’s Stratmann said. He said facility administrators are recruiting “like crazy," while also constantly working to rebuild supplies of protective equipment, emphasizing that they are working to protect residents as best they can. More help is always needed, he said. “Our residents are not statistics to us," he said. "We feel the same things as the families do about watching people in our facilities come down with this.” Baltimore Sun Media reporters Mary Grace Keller, Lillian Reed and Jean Marbella contributed to this article.

Most animal research suspended at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere amid coronavirus, raising questions about test subjects’ welfare
.W
As the coronavirus pandemic forces researchers to suspend laboratory work, some animal test subjects could be euthanized. At the Johns Hopkins University, for example, scientists recently were instructed to designate animals in their labs as “mission critical,” and told that others “may be euthanized as space/resources require.” So far, that hasn’t been necessary, said Eric Hutchinson, Hopkins director of research animal resources. Some mice have been euthanized because they lack a gene being studied in an experiment, he said. If more research was going on, those mice could have been used in another lab, he said. Hopkins Medicine officials said veterinarians and other staff are focused on ensuring that animals “remain healthy and well cared for" as some lab experiments are paused. But animal rights advocates argue such decisions show animal experimentation isn’t always vital. “The big question is, why are these animals who — when the experiments were approved by the school’s oversight body were deemed so imperative for human health — are now so easily discarded?” said PETA vice president of laboratory investigations Alka Chandna. At research institutions around the country, on-campus research activity is being restricted to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. While students are taking classes remotely for the rest of the academic year, students, faculty and postdoctoral researchers focused on lab experiments are being asked to stay home instead and analyze data or write papers and grant proposals. It’s unclear how many animals may be euthanized, or already have been. The most recent federal data available on animal research across the country shows that in fiscal year 2018, researchers used more than 780,000 animals as test subjects. That total includes primates, hamsters, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, pigs, rabbits and sheep, but not rats or mice, which are used most commonly. In Maryland, researchers used 32,418 animals that year, tenth-most among states. At the University of Maryland, Baltimore, all but “a tiny fraction” of research has been suspended since Monday, spokesman Alex Likowski said. And he said he was not aware of any animals being euthanized. University officials directed research teams to identify at least two people responsible for checking on animals “and providing for their welfare should further restrictions be required.” Hopkins Medicine officials said they are asking researchers designated as essential personnel in their labs to ensure health and welfare of lab animals, as well as keep projects going, preserve data and protect equipment. “We have many personnel, including veterinarians and other staff who are trained to care for our laboratory animals throughout this period," they said in a statement. As research leaders consider which experiments can go forward, an important factor is whether suspending a project “would be a waste of animal lives or resources,” Hutchinson said. He added that, so far, he doesn’t expect a need for any animals to be euthanized as a result of any lack of space or resources. Mice are the exception, he said. Scientists alter mice genomes and breed them to produce more mice with the same characteristics. Inevitably, some mice are born without the genotype desired for that particular experiment, and thus can’t be used in the project. Typically, efforts would be made to find other researchers who could use the mice, but with the “vast majority” of animal research suspended, that isn’t possible, Hutchinson said. Mice are euthanized with carbon dioxide gas, which puts them to sleep and eventually suffocates them. Otherwise, researchers are being asked to delay all orders for new animal test subjects save for experiments focused on COVID-19, the infection caused by the new coronavirus. Researchers say animal testing is critical in biomedical research as a way to learn about human biology. Stanford Medicine researchers say that mice and humans share 98% of their DNA and that because lab animals have shorter life cycles than humans, they can be observed throughout their life span and across generations. Federal regulators also still require that new drugs be tested on animals before they are approved for use by humans. Other means of testing are being explored. As the pandemic continues, the highest priority for medical researchers is any vaccine or treatment to combat the novel coronavirus. Hutchinson suggested the pathogen is a prime example of the potential value of animal research. Genetically altered mice could help scientists learn the pathway through which the coronavirus attacks the body, and then use that information to develop a treatment or vaccine. Animals typically are used in vaccine trials to make sure there are no toxic side-effects — and also because, to prove a vaccine is effective, subjects must be “challenged” with exposure to whatever pathogen they were created to offer protection from. But, given the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic, one clinical trial for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine is going forward at the National Institutes of Health without the typical phase of animal testing. PETA’s Chandna suggested that makes questions about the value of animal testing “even more valid and crucial.” Baltimore Sun reporter Meredith Cohn contributed to this article.

How Maryland hospitals are dashing to meet the call for 6,000 ‘new’ beds for coronavirus surge 
.W
In the mad dash to meet Gov. Larry Hogan’s call for 6,000 new hospital beds for a potential surge of coronavirus cases in Maryland, patients with COVID-19 could end up in a new wing, an alcove or even a tent. But for now, most new beds won’t actually be new. Hospitals are canceling surgeries or moving patients and their procedures to outpatient facilities. General medical beds that were once near full are now about a third empty. “Our hospitals have over 900 beds available now, and very few COVID-19 patients — thankfully,” said Bob Atlas, CEO of the Maryland Hospitals Association. “We’re prepared for a surge; we expect it in the weeks to come.” This doesn’t mean that there will be a lot more new beds coming immediately, even though Hogan spoke late last week on TV news shows about 900 “new” beds already available. Some hospitals have announced plans. Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore recently received emergency approval to add 32 beds in the next 2½ months. LifeBridge Health also reported Friday that Northwest Hospital in Randallstown would add 20 beds to an unused unit and 70 beds at Grace Medical Center, the former Bon Secours Hospital, in Baltimore, by the end of next week. The pressure remains on hospitals, however, to keep beds open while providing emergency care to heart attack, car crash victims and others. But despite guidance from federal and industry sources and their own temporary new policies against “elective” procedures, many hospitals will continue to also provide services that are not for emergencies. Hospitals are judging which services are urgent enough to continue in a hospital and whether more routine procedures may still be offered in outpatient facilities. “In the meantime, hospitals need to keep functioning,” Atlas said. “They are making sound judgments, using established clinical criteria, to determine which procedures can and should continue.” Continuing nonemergency procedures has led to some private grumbling among medical staff and a couple of complaints on Twitter, some under the hashtag #DoTheRightThing. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which pays a large portion of hospital costs, recommended last week delaying “non-essential” medical, surgical and dental procedures to preserve beds, as well as personal protective equipment and ventilators that are in short supply nationwide. “These hospitals are playing a very delicate game," said Tinglong Dai, an associate professor of operations management and business analytics at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School. He said they want to be perceived as “good citizens” during an unprecedented public health crisis, but there is a business side to health care that “swings them” to do different things. “If they play the game well and time things right, they may be able to shift to take care of COVID-19 patients when the number of cases peaks,” he said. "However, maintaining a high utilization means leaving very little margin for error and limits their responsiveness in such a highly fluid situation. It also consumes dwindling resources required for combating COVID-19.” It’s still not clear how many beds will be needed. So far, there have been 149 cases confirmed in Maryland, though testing is still ramping up and public health officials expect more cases despite closed schools, workplaces and malls and calls for people to keep their distance from one another. Maryland has 9,400 beds of all kinds, including for children and psychiatric patients, including 1,200 intensive beds for the most serious cases of the respiratory disease. Federal authorities have estimated that a moderate outbreak like the flu pandemic in 1968 would mean 1 million people hospitalized, including 200,000 needing intensive care. If it’s more like the severe 1918 flu pandemic, 2.9 million could need the ICU. That would mean thousands of extra beds would likely be needed in Maryland. Health and hospital officials say modeling now shows that the need for 6,000 new beds is a worst-case scenario. Hospitals are unlikely to ever fit them all within their walls, hospital officials say. That could mean reopening shuttered hospitals, though they said no plans are final. For now, there are 1,400 beds available, according to a daily census conducted by the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems, which coordinates emergency services in the state. “We have available beds; it’s looking quite good,” said Dr. Timothy Chizmar, state EMS medical director for MIEMSS. “State leaders are ensuring we have some capacity and planning for the eventuality that it may not be enough.”

Governors, led by Hogan, press federal government for more funding, testing, equipment during coronavirus pandemic
.W
The nation’s governors kept pressing the federal government for supplies and economic aid to battle the new coronavirus in a conference call with the White House on Monday without getting the assurances they were hoping to hear. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association, said the governors are seeking more testing, ventilators and personal protective equipment like masks for health care providers. The call with Vice President Mike Pence lasted about 75 minutes. “There aren’t enough of all of these items, and we’re pushing to get our supply wherever we can, and we’re pushing the federal government to produce more of them, distribute more of them, and hopefully we’ll get some progress," Hogan said earlier in the day. "There’s been a little bit of progress, but not nearly enough and not fast enough.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Monday that her state still was not getting enough help from the federal government. She said Michigan just received its allotment from the U.S. government’s national stockpile. For one hospital, she said, it is 747 N-95 masks, 204 gowns, 4,467 gloves and 64 face shields. “With the exception of the gloves, that allotment is barely enough to cover one shift at that hospital," Whitmer, a Democrat, said. "It’s not even a full day’s worth of shifts." Whitmer, citing efforts from companies in her state, said Michigan has secured more than 4 million gloves, 4 million N-95 masks and thousands of gallons of hand sanitizer. “While I can’t do overnight what the federal government should have done over the course of months in planning, my team and I are working 24/7 to secure the things we need,” Whitmer said. Michael Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, described the call Monday as “candid and constructive,” but without a breakthrough that the governors were seeking. “While we're not where we want to be on all of the governor's requests, we continue to see incremental progress and hope for some breakthroughs in the next few days,” Ricci said. Connected to the governors by video conference, Pence said he hoped their confidence was boosted by recent steps taken by the administration, including agreeing to pay the costs for New York, California and Washington state to call up the National Guard and for deploying field hospitals in those states. Pence told the governors to contact their regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to discuss specific supply needs, but offered that he’s always available to listen to them, too. “I’m a phone call away to any governor on this call,” the vice president said. In other developments, Congress hit another roadblock in talks to inject nearly $2 trillion into the economy. Another attempt to advance the aid bill on Capitol Hill failed in a Monday afternoon vote. “We’re still pushing very hard for major economic stimulus for monies to go directly to the states so that we can help these businesses and individuals that are impacted, and there’s still no action on that,” said Hogan, a Republican. Meanwhile, governors announced longer school closures. Virginia public schools will remain closed for the rest of the current school year and certain types of businesses — such as bowling alleys, gyms and theaters — must close in response to the outbreak, Gov. Ralph Northam said Monday. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday that he will soon sign an executive order that will keep the state’s schools closed until at least April 20. Lamont previously instituted a two-week school closure March 17. Hogan also said he would like to hear more action from the federal government on other priority areas governors presented to the White House on Thursday. He said some progress has been made on invoking Title 32, so that FEMA can cover the cost of National Guard relief missions and providing states with flexibility to use Guard resources. Hogan noted some federal assistance by extending deadlines relating to the 2020 census. However, he said states are still pushing to extend deadlines for Real ID compliance. Starting Oct. 1, those without a Real ID-compliant license or passport will not be able to board domestic flights, visit a military base or enter some federal buildings. Hogan, Northam and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a news release Monday night stating: "As leaders of the three jurisdictions of the National Capital Region, we carry a unique responsibility to keep the federal government operating. Our actions promote the health and safety of more than 360,000 federal workers who live and work across our three jurisdictions. No other region in the country bears this responsibility. "As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, we call on the federal government to provide additional financial support to help our jurisdictions maintain the health and safety of the region and the federal workers who serve the American people. The COVID-19 virus knows neither borders nor boundaries — it does not recognize state or city lines. We are working closely together to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. “Together, we are promoting social distancing and encouraging all of our residents to stay at home and avoid crowds and gatherings. In each of our jurisdictions, we will be enforcing crowd control measures and social distancing standards. We will continue to work together to keep our residents and the federal workforce as healthy and safe as possible in the coming weeks and months.” Associated Press reporters David Eggert in Lansing, Michigan, Alan Suderman and Sarah Rankin in Richmond, Virginia, Susan Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, and Darlene Superville contributed to this article.

Watch the BSO perform a powerful virtual symphony from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has released a new video of its musicians virtually performing a piece of music that’s meant to comfort and reassure audiences whose lives have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. The eight-minute piece consists of the powerful ending of “What Love Tells Me,” the final movement of Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 3. The orchestra had been rehearsing the symphony with music director Marin Alsop for concerts that were to have been performed March 12-14 for live audiences at the group’s two concert halls in Baltimore and North Bethesda. The concerts were canceled as concerns about the coronavirus intensified. ”The musicians were disappointed that we were unable to perform the work and decided to create a virtual performance,” Aubrey Foard, the principal tuba player, said in a BSO news release. ”We thought Mahler’s glorious and life-affirming coda from this symphony would help everyone feel a little better.” This is how the video was created, according to the news release: Each musician peformed his or her part at home. Violinist Colin Sorgi created a “click track” or a series of audio cues used to synchronize sound recordings, a technique that allows the coda to move with tempo changes as it would during a live performance. The musicians made a video and audio recording of themselves playing along to the click track and sent it to Sorgi, who compiled all of the pieces into a single video. (Other online content can be found at BSO OffStage.) The recording isn’t intended to be a polished performance. Instead, it’s an attempt to reach an audience isolated by social distancing measures and to offer them solace. Foard said in the release that the musicians want audience members to know that “the BSO is with them even when we’re all separated by physical distance.”

Rev. Francis X. Moan, recalled as a schoolmaster’s master, dies of coronavirus
.W
The Rev. Francis X. Moan, a Jesuit priest and former Loyola Blakefield administrator who later assisted with refugees, died of complications of COVID-19 on April 17 at Saunders House at Lankenau Hospital in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. He was 93 and had lived in his order’s North Roland Park residence. “Frank Moan was a schoolmaster’s master,” said The Rev. William J. Watters, former pastor of St. Ignatius Church in Mount Vernon. “He was an amazing teacher in a classroom. He loved teaching and had a passion for the classics. He was a tough, demanding teacher, too. And he also knew the boys sitting before him had great minds who could be challenged. He could mesmerize his students.” Born in Baltimore and raised on Mainfield Avenue, he was the one of 11 children born to Frank Moan and his wife, Emma. He attended St. Dominic School and was a 1945 graduate of Loyola High School at Blakefield. He entered religious studies at St. Isaac Jogues in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, and was ordained in 1957 at Woodstock College, a former Jesuit seminary in Howard County. He celebrated his first Mass at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Baynesville. He also earned a bachelor’s degrees in English from Spring Hill College in Alabama and in sacred theology from Woodstock College. Father Moan later earned a doctorate in education from Columbia University in New York. Before he became headmaster at Loyola Blakefield, he taught Latin, Greek and religion at Gonzaga High School in Washington, D.C., St. Joseph’s Prep in Philadelphia and St. Paul’s School in New Hampshire. John Stewart, the former dean of students at Loyola Blakefield, recalled Father Moan when he was named academic dean and oversaw academics at the school after a period of academic experimentation in the late 1960s. “He came in and did an excellent job with our corriculum and setting our school on a different path from what we had been doing,” said Mr. Stewart, an assistant to the president and dean of students for 33 years. "As a teacher he had a gift for getting the best out of his students. As an administrator, he got the best out of his teachers, too. Mr. Stewart also said, “He represented Jesuit pedagogy at its best.” After his time at Blakefield, Father Moan became a Jesuit university administrator. He later moved to Washington, D.C., and was an editor for National Jesuit News. During the 1980s and 1990s, Father Moan became the coordinator of the American Assistance Refugee Project and director of Refugee Voices, a publication and now a website where refugees tell their stories. He traveled the world in connection with his refugee work and spent time in Southeast Asia. A 1991 Baltimore Sun article described his work with Cambodian refugees living in the Philadelphia suburbs. Stephen Pomplon, a nephew, said, “I knew him as a family man and academic who was driven to fight for justice. He brought the plight of the refugee to the forefront. And within the family, he loomed larger than life. I remember him as a straightforward man who practiced strict academic rigors.” He remained active and occasionally wrote for America magazine, a national Jesuit publication. In 2011, he wrote a memoir, “Bless Me, Father," that discussed his decades of hearing penitents’ confessions. “I remember the first day I heard confessions. I had been assigned to weekend work in a large urban parish. As I was about to leave the rectory for the church, an elderly, experienced pastor stopped me with ‘Are you about to hear confessions for the first time?’ When I assented, he continued, ‘Don’t give any advice today. Just listen.’ It was excellent advice. I observe it often 53 years later.” After leaving the classroom, Father Moan lived at his order’s Colombiere Jesuit House in North Roland Park. He spent his weekends saying Masses at the Brightview Home in Timonium and at St. Joseph’s parish in Odenton. After suffering a fall, he spent his final years at Manresa Hall, a nursing facility for Jesuits in suburban Philadelphia. “For a person who was as accomplished as he was, he really had no airs,” said his nephew, Brian Woods, a Cockeysville resident. "He was down to earth and a friend to all. “I can remember being in a Bible studies class with him," said his nephew. “He wasn’t afraid to admit that there things in the Bible that are a mystery,” Mr. Woods said. “He was a great letter writer,” said Mr. Stewart, of Loyola Blakefield. “And years later, after I had been made a dean, he wrote me to say how happy he was that the practice of jug [a form of detention] had been brought back.” Survivors include numerous additional nieces and nephews. Plans for a memorial are incomplete.

47,500 Marylanders file for unemployment as state continues to impose coronavirus restrictions
.W
The Maryland Department of Labor says that 47,545 state residents filed claims for unemployment insurance the week ending April 18, a decrease of about 14,000 claims from the week prior. Statistics released Thursday by the department’s Division of Unemployment Insurance show that Marylanders are continuing to file for unemployment insurance at a significant rate due to the coronavirus pandemic. The rate of claims has declined this month after setting a record for the week ending April 4, when 108,508 Marylanders filed for unemployment. Nationally, the rate of unemployment claims continues to be high, but is also seeing a similar decrease. The federal Department of Labor said in a release that 4,427,000 people filed for unemployment insurance the week ending April 18, a decrease of 810,000 claims from the week before. The COVID-19 outbreak has put millions out of work across the country as businesses have been forced to close their doors and people stay at home to practice social distancing measures to stem the spread of the disease. From March 15 through April 18, more than 344,000 people filed for unemployment in Maryland, easily eclipsing the roughly 215,000 jobless claims the state said it received in all of 2019. Rural areas are seeing high concentrations of unemployment claims, according to state data. From March 15 through April 18, 4,869 Worcester County residents filed for unemployment, with a population of about 52,000 people according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Baltimore County, the third-most populated county in the state with about 820,000 people, led the state in jobless claims last week with 7,189 claims submitted last week. Montgomery County, the most populated county in the state with more than one million residents, had the second-most unemployment claims with 6,938. Roughly 26 million people across the country have filed for jobless aid in the past five weeks, according to the Associated Press.

Serving life as an accessory to a 1981 murder, a Jessup inmate dies of coronavirus at 61, family says
.W
Andrew Parker, an inmate at the Jessup Correctional Institution, died Monday night of coronavirus at the University of Maryland Medical Center, his family told the Baltimore Sun. Parker’s niece, Nekia Randall, said the family was notified of his hospitalization last week, six days after he was founded unconscious inside the prison. Parker is the second Maryland inmate to die from coronavirus in April. The Maryland Department of Corrections announced on Tuesday that an inmate in his 60s died from COVID-19. Randall confirmed to The Sun on Friday prior to his death that Parker had been hospitalized and suffered from several underlying health conditions. State corrections officials are refusing to identify inmates who die from coronavirus aside from providing an age range due to “privacy reasons,” Mark Vernarelli, a department spokesman, said. Vernarelli said the family of the inmate who died was notified within 45 minutes of his death, without mentioning that the inmate was Parker. Randall said the family wasn’t notified of Parker’s death until almost a day later. Joseph Green, Parker’s brother, said it was “horrible” the way the family found out that Parker was hospitalized for the virus. Doctors called the family, saying Parker needed a blood transfusion, the family said, and that he was progressively getting better. Until things suddenly changed. Now, with the department of corrections not identifying which inmates in the state die from the virus, Green says he wants his brother to be more than just a number of inmate falling victim to COVID-19 in Maryland. “The way that they put him in the hospital, they should have notified us,” Green said speaking on the department of corrections. “It’s not right, he’s more than a number and truth be told he served his time. 38 years is a long time to be in prison for something that you didn’t do,” he added. Parker was convicted on a life sentence at the age of 22 as an accessory to the murder of a Catonsville store owner in 1981, according to Sun archives. He was convicted by an all-white jury of seven women and five men, archives said. A county circuit court judge at the time told Parker that he was “fearful” that Parker would commit another crime. Parker responded to the judge saying “this is the black man’s grief" as he walked from the courtroom. He maintained his innocence throughout the appeals process that ended with a sentence of life plus 15 years. Originally from Catonsville, Parker spent almost 40 years in prison. He is the second inmate to have died at the Jessup Correctional Institution and had been hospitalized since April 13, the department said. That is the same day that the first death was recorded. Randall says Parker had three kids and many loving family members including a brother, nieces and nephews, and friends who kept in contact with him during his incarceration. “He was a good father and grandfather,” Randall said. The inmate’s death comes just a day after the department reported over 200 cases of COVID-19 among inmates, guards and other staff at its facilities throughout the state. In March, several city officials including Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby called on Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan to release elderly offenders who suffer from underlying health conditions and no longer are considered a flight-risk. The state’s Congressional delegation joined together to urge Hogan to take swift action to corral what they called the “rapidly spreading outbreak." This came just a day after a federal judge ordered the emergency release of Derrick Boone, a Baltimore inmate awaiting trial. Inmates in Baltimore city have said they have been left without many options, resorting to making face masks out of the clothes they wear for protection from the virus. The Jessup Correctional Institution has 52 total cases, including 17 inmates, 22 correctional officers and administrative employees, giving it the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases in the state system.

Protecting poultry workers through coronavirus testing is good for them and the economy | COMMENTARY
.W
Samuel R. Wilson Jr., a lifelong resident of Southern Delaware, thinks it’s a “dumb idea” for his state to test workers at local chicken processing plants for the COVID-19 virus. This observation, reported by the The News Journal, was made Tuesday during an online meeting of the Sussex County Council, on which Mr. Wilson has served since 2008. And why does Councilman Wilson, a farmer himself, think it’s unwise to test plant workers for a disease that has killed more than 61,500 Americans to date during a global pandemic? Because, he said, positive results will deter others from showing up for the job and, ultimately, lead to plant closures. "Where did [Delaware Gov. John Carney] get the bright idea to ... test the poultry workers?” Wilson is quoted as asking during the teleconference. “They’re losing millions of dollars because of this dumb idea.” You can hear it for yourself on the Wilmington, Delaware, based newspaper’s website, delawareonline.com. On the recording, the councilman is patiently reminded that testing is part of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines but he is not persuaded. The health of those essential employees who kill, bleed, de-feather, clean and butcher chickens doesn’t appear to enter his mind. Neither does the opportunity to protect the community. His entire argument is based on the financial hardship suffered if one or more plants close, and he clearly wants to avoid that at all costs. It’s reassuring to know that this is not the prevailing view in either Delaware or Maryland, where Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday that he is working with his counterparts in Delaware and Virginia to improve testing for poultry workers. He identified Salisbury as Maryland’s latest coronavirus hotspot, chiefly because of 262 poultry processing workers who have tested positive for the virus, most of whom commute to out-of-state plants. The governor further unveiled plans for a testing center for poultry workers at the parking lot of the Arthur W. Perdue Stadium, home to idled Delmarva Shorebirds, as well as an effort to guard against the virus spreading further into poultry processing plants in Salisbury and Hurlock. What’s truly worrisome about Mr. Wilson’s thought process is that it reflects a growing desire — expressed frequently but not uniquely by GOP officeholders — to get the nation working again, regardless of the consequences for the workers on the front lines. It was one thing when COVID-19 appeared to threaten everyone, it’s another when the danger is chiefly directed at grocery store clerks, meat packing plants employees, delivery people and others who don’t have the luxury of teleconferencing to their jobs, like members of the Sussex County Council. Nationwide, poultry plant workers are more likely to be Latino than white, according to the National Center for Farmworker Health. Would an elected official be nearly as anxious to deny COVID-19 tests to his own family members if they worked in a high-risk environment? What if some were over 60 or had compromised immune systems? But that’s not the circumstance for most members of Congress, or for President Donald Trump or for first son-in-law Jared Kushner who recently declared the U.S. coronavirus response a “great success story” and predicts the economy will be “rocking” by July. These are difficult times. The most recent jobless numbers show another 3.8 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, which means more than 30 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past six weeks. That’s awful. But unemployment is a circumstance from which one can recover. Death is not. Federal, state and local governments need to be cautious in their approach to reopening this nation’s workplaces and follow the best public health advice including increased screening of the asymptomatic. That their absence from the processing line might temporarily hamper the chicken nugget supply chain shouldn’t factor into those decisions. Keeping these hardworking folks, who often take home $25,000 or less cutting up broilers, healthy should. It’s not only good for them, it’s ultimately good for the economy.

McDaniels and writer Peter Jensen — offers opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers. It is separate from the newsroom.

If coronavirus hit Baltimore in the 1800s, early 1900s, patients would’ve been sent down Quarantine Road
.W
With coronavirus panic in full swing, many of us are heading to wholesale shops to stock up on disinfectant and frozen food in case we’re stuck at home for the next two weeks. Those who, like me, frequent the Costco in Glen Burnie are likely unaware of the area’s historic role in protecting Baltimore from deadly diseases. Just a few miles away in South Baltimore, in an industrial stretch known as Hawkins Point, there is a road called Quarantine. Drive up it and pass the city’s landfill — alarmingly close to capacity — along with a compost facility. At the end of the road there is a factory for wallboard maker United States Gypsum, and a fence with signs warning visitors to keep out. Not far away, the hulls of rusting ships jut, ghost-like, out of Curtis Creek. It’s here at this isolated outpost along the Patapsco, 8 miles from the rest of the city, that Baltimore’s sick — or those suspected of being ill — were taken for decades. The first quarantine hospital was built here following the yellow fever epidemic of 1794, according to William Travis Howard’s Public Health Administration and the Natural History of Disease in Baltimore Maryland, 1797-1920. Another was built in the late 1800s, operating through the mid-20th century. At least two other quarantine stations operated off and on in the 19th century. One was in nearby Fairfield and another at Lazaretto Point, in the Canton Industrial Area across from Fort McHenry. But the quarantine station at Hawkins Point was the most enduring. Patients sent from Baltimore to quarantine made the voyage via boat; the overland roads were too rough and unpaved. (The roads today aren’t much better. A modern driver may wonder if her car will flip over while crossing the next pothole.) Conditions at the Hawkins Point quarantine station varied over the decades. In 1899, according to an article in The Baltimore Sun, an official complained that the infirm were kept in the same place as people who were only possibly sick — and this allowed the spread of disease. Officials fought to secure more funding for Hawkins Point. In later years, the quarantine station campus included four buildings, with an isolation hospital that had space for 150 people. Patients could be a mix of Baltimoreans and international travelers. During a smallpox outbreak in 1900, 10 people arrived to Hawkins Point from Sparrows Point and other parts of the city. For decades, ships traveling into Baltimore’s port from foreign destinations were required to stop here before docking. They flew the yellow quarantine flag until passing inspection. Public health inspectors who came aboard were on the lookout for one of seven deadly diseases: cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, plague, anthrax, typhus or leprosy. In one case, according to a 1950 article in The Sun, a ship was detained because a crewman on board had a rash that doctors couldn’t identify. The entire exterior of the ship and everyone on board were drenched in toxic DDT as a precaution against typhus. Later taken over by the federal government, Baltimore’s quarantine station became part of a national system meant to protect Americans from deadly diseases. Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still operates 20 quarantine stations across the United States at airports and land-border crossings where international passengers arrive. The federal government closed Baltimore’s quarantine station in 1960, and debate over the site’s future began. City officials attempted to acquire the 20-acre stretch of land and turn it into a park. The Maryland Port Authority protested, with the executive director arguing that a park “could destroy our entire port and industrial development program in this section of the harbor.” The issue was covered by The Sun’s then-maritime editor Helen Delich Bentley, who openly disdained park proponents. An industrial site, argued the future Republican congresswoman, would be much more beneficial in the long run. Bolstering that argument were former residents of the quarantine station who claimed that nearby industry had killed off all the wildlife. “When we first moved there, there was crabbing. Now there is nothing because nothing can survive in the water,” said one. Another said the air was so foul that it made curtains rot. In the end, the pro-industrialists got their way. There is no park at Hawkins Point, and the road name is the only obvious reminder of its past use.

Schmuck takes: Remembering Jackie Robinson, more coronavirus developments and other random thoughts | COMMENTARY
.W
News item: Major League Baseball celebrated “Jackie Robinson Day” on Wednesday, 73 years after one of the great civil rights heroes of the 20th century broke the sport’s indefensible color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers on Opening Day in 1947. My take: This anniversary is particularly poignant at a time when all of America’s professional baseball players are not allowed to play because of the coronavirus pandemic. Plenty of time to ponder what it must have been like for Robinson to trot out to his position at Ebbetts Field that day knowing that a large swath of American society did not want to see him there. Historical news item: Robinson went hitless in three at-bats that day, but scored the decisive run in a 5-3 victory over the Boston Braves. My take: Lest anyone hope to form the impression that he did not belong in the majors, Robinson would register a hit or a run in 23 of his first 25 games, a span that included a 14-game hitting streak. He also had a 21-game hitting streak at midseason on his way to being named the Major League Rookie of the Year. News item: Dr. Anthony Fauci said during an interview this week that professional sports could resume soon if games are played without fans and players are quarantined in hotels while being tested regularly to detect the coronavirus. My take: Still think the no-fan Arizona and Florida scenarios would create huge logistical problems in those locations and lull the general public into a false sense that it’s OK to begin letting down their guards before the pandemic is contained. News item: Dr. Niraj Sehgal, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco and co-leader of UCSF’s COVID-19 command center, said in an interview this week that the Kansas City Chiefs’ dramatic victory over the 49ers in the Super Bowl might have been the best thing that could have happened to the Bay Area at the time, since a victory parade in San Francisco at that early stage of the coronavirus outbreak might have spawned widespread transmission of the virus in one of the pandemic’s early hotspots. My take: It wouldn’t have been the first time that fate — and pro sports — played an ironically positive role in a disaster scenario in that region. Following the deadly Loma Prieta earthquake that took place minutes before the start of Game 3 of the Bay Bridge World Series in 1989, experts speculated that many lives might have been spared because a huge chunk of the work force in both San Francisco and Oakland had left work early to attend the game or get home in time to watch it on television. News item: Organizers held out hope as long as they could, but were forced this week to postpone the Tour de France after French president Emmanuel Macron announced that all large events that draw big crowds will be canceled until mid-July. The world’s most famous bicycle race was originally scheduled to start June 27. The tentative new starting date for the three-week event is Aug. 29. My take: This is a huge blow to the blood-doping industry, but the rest of us will have to bear up under the disappointment. Fortunately, it’s still OK to take a bike ride on one of Maryland’s terrific bike and walking trails and it’s a great way to stay fit during the lockdown. News item: The Ravens are expected draft a wide receiver in the first round of the NFL draft two weeks from now … My take: ... or maybe an interior offensive lineman or an inside linebacker or an edge rusher or another possible replacement for Michael Pierce. See your favorite mock draft for further details. News item: Nevada’s gaming control expanded the ability of the state’s bookmakers to take bets on esports to help fill the huge revenue gap left by the suspension of all major team sports. My take: Can’t blame the wise guys for finding new ways to stay in a business that is getting a surprisingly big chunk of its drastically reduced revenue from — wait for it — international table tennis. Bonus take: In case you old-school Baby Boom gamers were wondering, “Pong” is not one of the esports available for wagering. News item: The Cleveland Browns unveiled their new uniforms for the 2020 season and beyond, which were designed to pay homage to the 1964 NFL championship team. My take: Fortunately, they decided against the bell-bottom pants.

The coronavirus curve is flattening because people changed their behavior | COMMENTARY
.W
There's an intense, often ugly debate over the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In broad brushstrokes, some contend that the lower-than-predicted death toll proves the models forecasting massive fatalities were needlessly sensational. Some even suggest they were deliberately so, to scare politicians, including President Trump, into taking drastic and unnecessary action. A few conspiracy theorists — so-called “coronavirus truthers” — see more sinister motives at play. But, as is always the case, these cranks and grifters are best ignored, so I won’t shine a light on them here. The serious debate centers around whether the initial models were always exaggerated, or whether the response to them is driving down fatalities more effectively than epidemiologists predicted. For what it's worth, my opinion is "both." What makes the debate uglier than it needs to be is that many of the people denouncing the initial projections want to make the case that our response was deliberately misguided from the beginning —so much media hype, partisan point scoring and ideologically motivated crisis exploitation — and that we never should have shuttered the economy. I think these people are mostly on the wrong side of the argument, but I don't begrudge anyone who's desperate to get the country working again. The economic toll of this pandemic is staggering and will be felt for a generation or more, even if we get the much-craved "V"-shaped recovery when the all-clear is sounded. The first error is assuming that the scientists at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Imperial College London, National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were acting in bad faith. Just because a cashier makes a math error when giving you change doesn't mean he's trying to steal from you. And just because these models weren't perfectly oracular doesn't mean anyone was lying. Of course, predicting the spread of a new virus across the globe isn’t remotely like calculating the correct change for a bag of potato chips. We’re talking about the interdependent behavior of hundreds of millions of Americans, and billions globally, across institutions, communities and borders. It’s almost surely the case that the models were wrong to one degree or another for the simple reason that any model is only as good as the data fed into it. With imperfect information — partly thanks to the outrageous dishonesty of the Chinese government and the grave missteps of the World Health Organization ― it was inevitable that the models would never be more than best guesses. We’re far from out of the woods, but the fact that “only” some 60,000 Americans may die instead of 240,000 seems like something to celebrate, not an excuse to scapegoat officials who scrambled to save lives. Still, there's an interesting assumption common to both sides of the debate: that the government is responsible for all of this. Both defenders and the critics start from the premise that government diktats are the only variable here. My American Enterprise Institute colleague Lyman Stone, an economist based in Hong Kong, makes the case that the essential variable in "flattening the curve" isn't central planning but behavior change. Many businesses closed down well before they were ordered to. Millions of people practiced social distancing and refused to get on planes not because they were commanded to, but because they were convinced this was a wise course of action for themselves and their loved ones. People change their behavior when they are given clear information about risks. Various countries have flattened the curve of COVID-19 cases in different ways, Mr. Stone explained on my podcast, The Remnant. Some relied heavily on contact tracing, others on quarantining the sick, others through lockdowns — or all of the above. “But what we’ve seen in every country is that what really does it is information,” Mr. Stone said. Information doesn’t just come from governments. The death tolls in Italy and New York probably did more to change behavior on the ground than all of Mr. Trump’s press conferences or Dr. Anthony Fauci’s TV appearances. And this raises another complication for those who think the government can just “re-open” the economy with the flick of a switch. Mr. Trump and all of the governors could lift the stay-at-home orders and federal advisories tomorrow. That wouldn’t necessarily fill the restaurants, airplanes or stadiums. People would still need to be convinced it’s safe. Such persuasion comes via clear, believable information, not orders from on high. And that's how it should be in a free society.

For rebuilding Orioles, Mike Elias ‘calm and patient’ about coronavirus shutdown’s impact on draft, player development
.W
While acknowledging there are more pressing concerns because of the coronavirus pandemic, Orioles executive vice president and general manager Mike Elias thinks baseball returning will mean a lot to the country when it’s safe to play again. A return to normalcy for his Orioles won’t necessarily be nightly games at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, though. The Orioles are entering their second year under Elias, who was hired in November 2018 to build what he called an elite talent pipeline using the draft, international scouting and player development to create a sustainable playoff contender. All of that is essentially on hold, with no development time for minor leaguers, frozen international transactions, and no scouting allowed ahead of a draft that might not happen in mid-June as planned. Elias said Thursday on a conference call that while every team is dealing with the same restrictions and limitations, all he can do is be “calm and patient about it” as what’s clearly been a priority for the Orioles is put on hold. “There are a lot of concerns with baseball and a sudden layoff of this type,” Elias said on a conference call Thursday. “That’s one of them. I think every player in every organization will be impacted the same way, so that will alleviate some of the ill effects of this disruption when it comes to minor leaguers.” According to multiple reports, the league is considering myriad changes to the June draft, which for organizations such as the Orioles are essentially the lifeblood of the operation. The Associated Press reported the league was considering skipping the draft entirely to devote the cash spent on signing bonuses to other areas of baseball operations. Elias said he hopes there’s a draft this year for a number of reasons, but knows it’s far down baseball’s priority list. He said the league and its committee of scouting directors tasked with addressing draft-related issues were in frequent communication about discussions, and on Thursday “issued guidance that we’re basically freezing all scouting activities so that teams aren’t trying to create advantages for themselves in this idle period while there’s this public-health crisis going on. “I like the fact that we’ve been officially frozen in terms of our activities," Elias said. "We can still evaluate players using video and data and the scouts can update their scouting reports. I’ve given our staff some pretty specific instructions about how we want them to spend their time as they’re housebound, and I am extremely confident that we will be as prepared or more prepared than any other team given the way that our department is set up and the way they’ve been working since the summer started, that we’ll be in good shape for this draft whenever it takes place or however it takes place.” Since they finished with the second-worst record in baseball in 2019, the Orioles will have the second overall pick in the draft to add to what’s already a vastly improved farm system since Elias took over. Some of that is new draftees from 2019, while plenty of holdover prospects from the Dan Duquette administration benefited from a year in the Orioles’ new pitching program. This year was meant to be a step forward in how they taught hitting, but without games, it’s unclear how that development would continue. From a player-development standpoint, months off at this stage will be something that could delay the arrival of several Orioles prospects as major league ready, whether that arrival was supposed to be this summer or years from now. Top pitching prospects such as Grayson Rodriguez and DL Hall had both been in Sarasota, Florida, training with early-camp pitchers for about a month at the time of the shutdown, while top overall prospect Adley Rutschman was in major league camp for several weeks before going over to minor league camp. Hall was set to start the season at Double-A Bowie, with Rutschman and Rodriguez likely to be at High-A Frederick. Those assignments aren’t likely to change, but the timeline for promotions and climbing the ladder might. Elias said it’s a difficult time for the young players who were just drafted last year to learn the professional game. In the Orioles’ case, Gunnar Henderson and Darell Hernaiz were drafted as high school shortstops last summer and would have likely played every day in extended spring training after camp ended. Instead, they’re back home like the approximately 150 minor leaguers that were in camp. “It’s tough for young guys, especially guys right out of high school who are still in A-ball, those are really precious at-bats,” Elias said. “And there are college players out there that aren’t getting at-bats. There’s just no baseball being played.” Manager Brandon Hyde, who spent most of his coaching career in player development, thinks the shutdown could impact that front. “This can cripple the development a little bit, in that you want guys to get innings,” Hyde said. "You want guys to get at-bats. You want guys to go through full seasons, especially early on, understanding what it takes to live through a full season and compete for a full season. That’s going to be cut short. ... “If guys have to miss some time and miss some innings and at-bats in 2020, we’ll roll with it and go from there. But from a player-development standpoint, you want guys to rack up at-bats and want pitchers to have meaningful innings. Right now, they just can’t do that.” Adding more young players could be hampered as well, both with the draft and international signings. While Elias said the Orioles weren’t in the process of adding anymore international signees to the largest class in franchise history — 42 players for over $4.9 million in signing bonuses once all pending deals are approved — scouting there was frozen as well. “I guess the takeaway is everyone’s impacted the same way, and will be in the same boat,” Elias said. “Overall, whatever affect that has will not affect one player over another. It’s going to be something that we’re continually assessing and talking about during the layoff. It’s just one of these things we’re going to have to deal with it.”

New Windsor planning to celebrate graduating seniors amid coronavirus school closures
.W
New Windsor Mayor Neal Roop announced that the town will celebrate the graduating seniors in town with banners as large gatherings are still prevented by COVID-19 and the executive orders designed to mitigate its spread. Maryland officials announced Wednesday that public schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year. Even though it is up to superintendents to make the decision on whether they will have some form of graduation, according to Roop, the mayor still wanted to create some way for the town to celebrate them. Roop pitched the idea to have banners displayed through town for the month of June, a 30-day period, or a 60-day period or for the entire summer and take them down Labor Day, during the virtual town council meeting Wednesday night. They talked about honoring 2020 high school or college grads. According to Roop, the banners will cost $100, including the hardware. Treasurer Donna Alban mentioned the idea of having one big banner will all the graduates in town. Other members of the council seemed to like this idea as well. If the town decides to do separate banners, the costs will be covered by the families of the graduates and if they decided to go with the big banners, there will be two and they will be covered by the town. The big banners will be displayed in the Beer and Wine Garden and on the corner of Md. 75 at Green Valley Road and Main Street, where the gazebo is. A final decision on which they will do to honor the students has yet to be made. In another effort from the town to do something positive during the coronavirus pandemic, the town council also discussed executing a Sidewalk Coloring Contest. According to Roop, they have not yet finalized when it will be held but plan to hold it over a two-week period, depending on weather. For those that don’t have sidewalks, Roop thinks the carnival grounds would be the best place for them to go and space out so they can draw their art. Participants will be able to submit their art via Facebook and winners will relieve gift cards from local businesses, which businesses have yet to be finalized.

Retirement community coronavirus precautions separate husband from terminally ill wife | READER COMMENTARY
.W
Those citizens demonstrating to ease restrictions meant to control the spread of the coronavirus are ignoring the advice of health experts and putting the lives of the rest of us in jeopardy (“Governors face pressure to reopen,” April 20). I support the measures being enforced in Maryland to keep us safe and well. These include staying at home except for essential trips, wearing a face mask when outside the home and maintaining a safe distance from other individuals. But the rules meant to protect us have made some of us victims of tragic unintended consequences. I reside in the independent section of Edenwald, a retirement community located in Towson, and my wife resides in the assisted living area, which prohibits visitors under the state’s nursing home guidelines. That means I cannot be with my wife, as I am considered an outside visitor, the same as if I were coming in from the street. My wife is terminally ill and it is agonizing for me to be unable to be with her in these tragic times. I cannot believe that the rules were intended to separate loving spouses when neither can be considered as having been exposed to the virus. Certainly, we both are far safer than the staff of Edenwald that routinely comes in every day from the street. The rules meant to protect us from the virus must include flexibility to allow loving spouses to be reunited.

Dan Quayle says Trump is doing a fine job handling coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
He was the 44th vice president of the United States in the George H.W. Bush administration, but for the last 20 years, Dan Quayle has stayed mostly away from the unfriendly glare of political life. I called him to get his thoughts on the coronavirus and the current political scene. On the virus and the approach to it by the Trump administration, Mr. Quayle said, “I think they’re doing a very good job. They know what they’re doing.” Echoing President Trump’s optimism, he, too, is optimistic about what comes after the virus is defeated: “We’ll get back to where we were…I don’t think it will be a V-shape recovery as many people are (saying). It will probably be more like a U-shape recovery, which will take a little longer.” Mr. Quayle had a thought about China and its near monopoly on the production of drugs: “We used to have a section in the (U.S.) Code that gave a tax preference to pharmaceutical companies that manufactured their products in Puerto Rico.” He’s right, but Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed a law phasing out those tax breaks and by 2006, as the New York Post reported, “the industry began a major pullout from the island.” “They left Puerto Rico and went to China,” Mr. Quayle recalled. “I ask you today: would you rather have medications produced in Puerto Rico, or in China?” The former vice president believes the country that could be the "big winner in this, if they get their act together, is Mexico. The Mexicans are hard workers, family oriented, good values and the cost of labor is less in Mexico. Even if (the drug companies) don't bring it back to the United States, at least bring it back to North America." Mr. Quayle admits the policy of engaging China, bringing them into the World Trade Organization and other international organizations, hoping they would be less authoritarian and more democratic (a policy known as collective engagement) “has not worked. They want us out of the Pacific so they can be the dominant player in the world and we have to recognize this. Instead of becoming more democratic and more in favor of human rights, they have moved in the opposite direction.” Asked about the current political scene and the coming contest between Joe Biden and President Trump, Mr. Quayle, who has known Mr. Biden for over 30 years, including their time as Senate colleagues, says Mr. Biden is the “safe” choice for Democrats, who feared the damage Bernie Sanders would cause to their candidates “down ballot.” He says we’ll have “a much better feel on this after Labor Day,” but that “the American people tend to rally around a president in a crisis situation. On the other side, Mr. Trump has always talked about the stock market setting records and the economy roaring and it’s the best economy in 50 years. He won’t be able to say that any longer, (but) if it comes back he will be able to make a good case for his re-election. Mr. Biden is just going to be the anti-Trump candidate.” Mr. Quayle thinks his fellow Hoosier, Vice President Mike Pence, is “doing an outstanding job. He’s a comforting voice. He knows his facts. He does his homework.” Despite the mocking criticism he often received when he was vice president, Mr. Quayle says he misses the politics, including running the country and being in the Senate. But he says: “I have no desire to go back there. It’s a noble cause. I wish more men and women would get involved in politics. We’d be better off for it.” For the last two decades, Mr. Quayle has been chairman of Cerberus Capital, an investment fund. He has an office in New York and a home in Phoenix. For him, life is good. For the country at the moment, not so much. Look for Cal Thomas’ new book “America’s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires and Superpowers and the Future of the United States."

Multiple Maryland universities cancel classes to stem coronavirus, plan to go remote after spring break
.W
Many Maryland college students are headed to spring break next week, and they likely won’t return to their campuses as multiple universities said Tuesday that they will opt for remote instruction to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Towson University and Morgan State University have canceled classes for the rest of this week, as did the private Loyola University of Maryland and Notre Dame of Maryland University. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County has canceled classes on Thursday and Friday and will hold online classes in the two weeks following spring break. Additionally, Johns Hopkins University canceled in-person classes for all students starting Wednesday, and planned to transition to remote instruction at least through April 12. “It is all a matter of balancing the risks and being as prudent as we can in the public health sense,” said Joann Broughman, senior vice chancellor for academic affairs and student life for the University System of Maryland. Jay A. Perman, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, “strongly urged” the system’s 12 campuses to prepare for remote instruction for at least two weeks after the break. Perman said the campuses would remain open for students, including those from abroad, who can’t or hadn’t planned to go home or away during the weeklong break. College presidents in the system have wide latitude to make their own decisions, but if they followed Perman’s directive, some 177,000 undergraduate and graduate students would continue their studies online after the break. Several of his presidents quickly issued directives Tuesday for faculty to begin online teaching when classes resume March 23. The flagship University of Maryland, College Park told students that before leaving for break to “please take all essential belongings, medications, and materials” from dorms and workspaces. Classes are canceled the week after break, March 23-29, and they will be taught remotely for at least the following two weeks. Students should plan not to return to classes on campus until at least April 10, although the university will remain open and will accommodate those who need to be there. The fast-moving and fluid situation threw campuses across the state into a flurry of activity as students and faculty tried to plan for any number of scenarios. “It’s a little chaotic,” said Ireland Lesley, student government president at the College Park campus. “Right now a lot of students are in this limbo.” But Lesley, 21, a senior, said she is confident that school, health and government officials are working together to come up with “what’s best for the health and safety of our campus." “It’s really not impacting young people as much. But we’re trying to take precautions for the most vulnerable members of our community,” she said of older, higher-risk students and staff. Several faculty members said that while they believe in-person instruction is most effective, they understand the need to address the potential spread of the virus. They expressed concern about classes such as science labs that can’t be conducted remotely. Towson University faculty “take teaching seriously,” said Jennifer Ballengee, an English professor who chairs the school’s Academic Senate. “I think a lot of us worry that the online class might be somewhat less effective; in other words, we don’t like the idea of students not getting the best learning experience they can have.” Still, she said, students and faculty understand the need to go off campus when possible. “This is a public health crisis and it means that we can’t expect anything to be as usual,” Ballengee said. "I had a good talk about it with my students. We talked about how it’s a bit unusual in the country at this time to think of doing something ‘for the public good,’ but in this case that’s what has to happen. “While they themselves might not suffer much from the virus, if they were to contract it, they might spread it to someone who could be severely affected by it, or even die,” she said. “In addition, the spread of the virus could put a severe strain on our hospital system, affecting all kinds of people who might need hospital care anyway — someone having a baby, or having a heart attack or suffering some other kind of health issue.” Jasmine White, 21, a junior at Coppin State University in Baltimore, said she saw “a lot of people already packing” in her dorm Tuesday. Coppin officials told students Tuesday that after next week’s break, professors would teach classes remotely and students should prepare to remain off campus at least until April 6. “I think it’s a good idea,” said White, who co-chairs the school’s Student Activities Programming Board. “I think our top priority is for students to be safe." White said students are tech-savvy and already comfortable online, and Coppin was offering video instruction on how to navigate the Blackboard digital learning app. “This is not just a campus issue,” she said. “It’s a worldwide emergency.” Students at St. John’s College in Annapolis are on break this week. They won’t be back on campus for an additional two weeks, returning for class March 30, college spokesman Michael O’Connor wrote in an email statement. Anne Arundel Community College, with campuses in Arnold, Glen Burnie and Hanover, goes on spring break Monday. It will be extended an additional week, with students also coming back March 30. Frostburg State University will remain open this week, however all classes will shift to online instruction until at least April 6. The campus will remain open following spring break, with food service, the library and the computer labs available to students. Salisbury University has canceled classes on Thursday and Friday of this week, and will conduct classes online from March 23 to April 3. Students should not return to campus until April 4. The University of Baltimore will move its classes online for at least two weeks beginning March 23. Harford Community College announced plans to cancel all classes Thursday and Friday and will “implement an online working and learning environment” following spring break. Nine people in Maryland have now tested positive for the virus in Maryland. The novel strain of the coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has sickened 118,596 people across the world and killed 4,262 of those. There have been 959 cases of the virus confirmed across more than 30 U.S. states, with 28 dead from the disease. Perman gave university presidents the leeway to tailor their preparations to their individual campuses and give staff enough time to prepare for the coming weeks. Perman said he was consulting with the USM presidents and public health experts about additional operational issues, such as services offered to students who have to remain on campus during and after spring break, as well as upcoming large gatherings, such as graduation and athletic events. He said he expected to provide additional guidance in the coming days. “Given the residential nature of the universities within the System,” Perman said, “USM must apply an abundance of caution to ensure that students and employees are protected and safe.” UMBC President Freeman Hrabowski said in a university announcement that classes are canceled Thursday and Friday. The decision was made to allow students, staff and faculty “time to prepare for the transition to fully online instruction when classes resume after Spring Break," the announcement said. The university is advising students to not return to campus for at least two weeks after break and said online instruction will take place instead. Staff members are expected to return to work March 19. UMBC will remain open for “essential purposes," including the academic and administrative offices. Campus events also are canceled through April 6. Morgan State University has decided to cancel classes for the remainder of the week and will go to remote teaching after spring break, according to spokesman Dell Jackson. At the end of the two-week period, the university will reassess the situation to determine what to do next, he said. The Peabody Conservatory, part of Johns Hopkins University, announced that from Wednesday to Sunday all classes, lessons, rehearsals, performances and events are canceled. This includes Wednesday’s PSO concert at Shriver Hall, all four public performances of La Rondine, and any student recitals scheduled during this time. Loyola said all in-person instruction is discontinued starting Wednesday for the rest of the month. After spring break, faculty will teach all classes online starting March 18. Residence halls are expected to close Friday and all students should return home “as soon as possible,” the university said. The university said it will remain open and expects classes to resume April 1. Employees are expected to report “as scheduled." Notre Dame of Maryland officials said classes will resume via remote instruction after spring break next week through at least April 5, with the exception of programmatic clinical, practicums, and internships. Face-to-face classes are tentatively scheduled to resume on April 6. The class cancellations this week will allow faculty and staff to finalize plans for remote instruction beginning March 23, Notre Dame officials said in a statement. Employees were told to report to work as scheduled. However, students were told to take home all essential belongings including medication and course material when the Notre Dame residents halls close Friday at 3 p.m. In an email to students and faculty on Tuesday, Towson University wrote that it will cancel classes for the rest of the week starting Wednesday. A follow-up email from the university official canceled all Towson-sponsored events and activities through April 4. Additionally the university said all face-to-face classes would resume April 6. After spring break, which extends from March 14-22, the university is planning to institute distance learning. “Beginning Wednesday, March 11, TU is cancelling all university classes for the remainder of the week on all campuses (including [Towson University in Northeast Maryland], Shady Grove, College of Southern Maryland, and Hagerstown) to prepare for potential remote teaching, learning and working after spring break,” the email reads. “When preparing to leave for spring break, we ask students to take all essential belongings, medications, and materials from your residence hall or work space in case it should become necessary to restrict return access to campus for at least two weeks,” the email continues. Towson wrote that there are no confirmed cases on the university’s campuses, but the school recognizes “that these are extraordinary times that require exceptional measures to deal with a health risk that affects us all.” University officials this week asked nine students and a professor to self-quarantine after attending a conference in Washington, D.C., after several other attendees were diagnosed with the virus. A group of 14 students at Loyola have self-quarantined after school officials learned they might have come into contact with an individual who may have had the virus while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor last month, spokeswoman Rita Buettner said. McDaniel College announced Wednesday that all instruction will be moved online for two weeks after spring break out of “an abundance of caution” to prevent spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. The last day of face-to-face classes before spring break will be Friday. Residence halls will close at 5 p.m. on Sunday, and classes will resume — but in an online format — on March 23. David Kass, a finance professor at College Park, said he’s canceled an annual trip to Charlottesville, Virginia, with his students. He’s been practicing how to conduct his classes online, and said that’s where university instruction was headed even before the outbreak. He still prefers to teach in person, and wonders how he will be able to gauge class reactions. “I read the body language in the room and I can react,” he said. "I look to see if a student is confused. I can sense if they’re engaged. “But obviously, I have 50 students in each class,” Kass said, “I can’t see how they’re reacting in 50 different remote locations.” Baltimore Sun reporters McKenna Oxenden, Phil Davis and Lillian Reed contributed to this article.

Lawmakers push for racial breakdown in Maryland’s public coronavirus data, seek to spot disparities early
.W
Every morning at 10 a.m., the Maryland health department publishes an update to its sobering data about the rapidly spreading coronavirus. The latest state data showed the number of cases among people ages 10 to 19 more than doubled over three days. It documented how the number of cases among women in Maryland surpassed those among men. And it registered cases as they’ve sprung up in county after county after county. But absent so far is a breakdown of cases by race. Some lawmakers say publishing this information while the pandemic is ongoing is vital so that state officials can monitor any disparities as they arise. “We’ve always known that, historically, there’s been health disparities in communities of color. It’s important to get ahead of it," said state Del. Nick Mosby, a Baltimore Democrat who is running for City Council president. Mosby started using social media Sunday to push the state to begin publicly tracking cases by race, in addition to age, gender and geographic location. Doctors across the country are making similar calls as some researchers caution black people in America could be hit especially hard by the public health crisis. Baltimore’s population is more than 60% black. Asked during a Monday news conference whether the state could report cases by race, deputy state health secretary Fran Phillips said, “I’m not aware that we have looked into that.” A spokesman for Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, Mike Ricci, said Monday he didn’t have an update on Mosby’s request. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet made data available by race, either, although high-profile Democratic lawmakers are pushing for more public information. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley said comprehensive demographic data on people who are tested or treated for the virus that causes COVID-19 is not available. “This lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” the Massachusetts lawmakers wrote Friday. Healthy equity advocates say detailed data is an important tool in the fight against the virus. U.S. cities with large black and brown populations, such as Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and New Orleans, have emerged as hot spots of the coronavirus outbreak. “We need a tangible picture of what is happening, so we can plan better and not, after this is over, look back and see gross disparities in treatment and in outcomes,” said Gail Christopher, executive director of the National Collaborative for Health Equity. Communities of colors have faced documented disparities that could exacerbate the impact of the new coronavirus. Black people in America suffer higher rates of asthma and diabetes — the kinds of underlying health conditions that could put patients at a greater risk of COVID-19 complications. Mosby said health care workers’ implicit bias and other barriers to treatment also could "imperil communities already on the front lines of multiple public health threats.” “Because of the stress that this pandemic will place on hospital capacity, soon residents will not be able to walk into hospital emergency rooms for screening,” he said. “This will have an adverse impact on populations who are less likely to have insurance and primary care physicians.” Dr. Lisa Cooper, who leads the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity, said many people of color have fears about the way they will be treated by hospitals. The story of Henrietta Lacks, a black woman whose cells were collected for research without her permission or knowledge, is ubiquitous in Baltimore. With better data, Cooper said, Maryland officials could perhaps tailor their public health messaging to specific at-risk communities. Early in the pandemic, some people spouted a myth that black people can’t contract the virus. Some Baltimore community organizers say they must combat such misinformation and apathy as they fight the disease’s spread in their neighborhoods. Dr. Ebony Hilton, a University of Virginia School of Medicine professor of anesthesiology, said she’s both concerned that there is a disparity in who is getting tested and that there’s a lack of data to prove whether or not her concern is justified. Hogan said Monday that drive-through testing sites have opened at Motor Vehicle Administration emissions stations in Bel Air, Glen Burnie and Waldorf, as well as at FedEx Field in Landover. Testing at the sites is limited to people with doctor’s orders and an appointment. Hilton questioned which patients will be able to get such a doctor’s order, especially when some of the symptoms could be considered subjective. How will implicit and explicit racial bias, she asked, play into a doctor’s decision about who receives a sought-after test? A handful of other Maryland lawmakers echoed Mosby’s call for racial data on coronavirus cases. “We know that racial bias in health care exists and only data can help ensure we make any necessary course corrections,” Del. Jheanelle Wilkins tweeted Monday. “Every Marylander benefits from a crisis response that takes an equity approach."

Gov. Hogan’s tightening of coronavirus restrictions: a stay-in-place order by another name | COMMENTARY
.W
Worried about rising coronavirus cases and fatalities, and still angry that some people aren’t taking COVID-19 restrictions seriously enough in the region (as evidenced by weekend crowds viewing the cherry blossoms in D.C.), Gov. Larry Hogan attempted to thread the needle Monday, announcing tighter rules to close “non-essential” businesses in Maryland, and offering expanded aid to small businesses and unemployment insurance benefits. He stopped short of ordering a shelter-in-place directive, and made a point of saying so — a message likely meant to convey that he needs to address the public health threat, but is also mindful of the economic consequences. Still, what other states — including neighboring Delaware — are calling “shelter-in-place” looks a great deal like what Mr. Hogan sees as the “closing of nonessential businesses.” Just look at what he said after declaring there was no such directive: "We are telling you unless you have an essential reason to leave your house, then you should stay in your homes.” That’s not exactly a shelter-out-of-place order. And there’s good reason for it. As Mr. Hogan observed, Maryland has now reported nearly 300 COVID-19 cases in most of the state’s 24 subdivisions, including a third fatality that was announced Saturday, a Montgomery County woman in her 40s. Maryland’s numbers are in what might be described as the second tier of the outbreak within the U.S. — having “widespread” community transmission, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and reported cases in the “100 to 500” category similar to Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio, all of which have either already imposed a shelter-in-place rule or closed nonessential businesses. If anything, Maryland has been slightly behind the curve in business restrictions. Mr. Hogan is correct to attack the matter on two fronts, though, as a public health emergency and also as an economic crisis in the making. But at least on that latter front, there are some positive signs. While unemployment numbers are already rising and there is certain to be hardship ahead, it appears the Baltimore area, for one, is less at risk than many of its peers. According to a recent Brookings study, of nearly 400 U.S. metropolitan areas in danger of economic hardship from the COVID-19 outbreak (those more dependent on “high risk” industries such as tourism or consumer spending, for example), the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson area ranks No. 232. San Francisco, in contrast, is pegged at 162 and Chicago at 81. Within Maryland, the jurisdiction most in danger can be found near the Atlantic Ocean resorts with Salisbury rated at 25. But if the governor is showing symptoms of cold feet, we would urge him to be bold and call his order what it is to avoid confusion and impart the seriousness of the situation. Marylanders understand (better than most, perhaps, an advantage gained from the presence of the National Institutes of Health and preeminent medical research centers like Johns Hopkins) that the tougher the restrictions now, the less severe the outbreak later. We can handle the words “shelter in place.” If anything, we like our medicine undiluted, the better to get well faster. What we don’t appreciate is the kind of dithering we are seeing from just down the road in the nation’s capital. And sheltering in place does not have to mean staying inside and locking your doors. It’s not a lockdown or a quarantine. It can be narrowly tailored to allow some movement — to retrieve or deliver essential items, goods and services, say, or movement for sanity’s sake, like taking a walk in the woods (staying at least 6 feet away from other walkers, of course). It can be tailored to be exactly what Governor Hogan has already ordered. By refusing to call his directive a shelter in place order, many residents could still see this as a time to socialize and run out to the grocery store whenever the mood strikes, rather than to carefully plan ahead and consolidate trips. We undertand that Mr. Hogan and other governors dealing with this scenario are like race car drivers building their vehicles while zooming along at 100 miles an hour. Caution is certainly in order. But doing too little and watching the fatality rate go up, as seniors and those with compromised immune systems bear the brunt of those decisions, is as great a risk as making the tough choices now and dealing with economic consequences of that as the public health threat subsides. We simply don’t get a second chance to contain the spread of a highly contagious disease.

Feds give $7 million to Maryland health centers to expand coronavirus testing 
.W
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is giving nearly $7 million to expand coronavirus testing in underserved communities in Maryland. The Health Resources and Services administration will distribute the money, $6,975,492, to 18 health centers in the state, according to the HRSA website. In Baltimore, awards include: $929,779 to Baltimore Medical System Inc.  $699,529 to Chase Brexton Health Services Inc.  $611,314 to Total Health Care Inc.  $178,054 to Family Health Centers of Baltimore Inc.  $238,969 to Health Care for the Homeless  $204,274 to Park West Health Systems Incorporated In a statement, department secretary Alex Azar called widespread testing “a critical step in reopening America.” Health centers, he said, play a vital role particularly in vulnerable and minority communities. Health centers will use the money to buy tests and personal protective equipment and to pay for training, outreach and laboratory services. Centers may also expand walk-up or drive-thru testing capabilities and notify the contacts of infected patients of exposure to COVID-19, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Nearly $583 million total was awarded to 1,385 sites across the U.S. The amount of money varies widely by state; health care centers in California received a total of more than $97 million, while New York, one of the states hardest hit by the virus, was allocated around $40 million. The Health Resources and Services administration previously awarded $1.42 billion to health centers to address the pandemic. The latest funding comes from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, signed into law April 24.

Under pressure, Maryland to post data on coronavirus at nursing homes, which account for most COVID-19 deaths in some counties
.W
Amid pressure from families, patient advocates and the nursing home industry itself, Maryland said Monday that it will begin releasing data on coronavirus infections and deaths at long-term care facilities this week. The announcement comes days after state officials denied requests for that information from The Baltimore Sun, and after health officials also refused to share it with the state’s largest nursing home associations. A state health official said disclosing how many cases or deaths have occurred at specific facilities would compromise patients’ right to privacy and serve “no public health purpose.” The about-face comes as county health officials revealed to The Sun on Monday that nursing homes and other long-term care facilities account for a significant portion of the 858 COVID-19 deaths reported across the state as of Monday. In Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties, for example, residents of those communities represent two-thirds of deaths confirmed or suspected to be coronavirus-related, county officials said. Long-term senior care facilities account for 17% of deaths in Prince George’s County, 29% in Baltimore City, 36% in Harford County, 54% in Howard County, 67% in Baltimore County, 71% in Anne Arundel County, and more than 90% in Carroll County, where more than two dozen people have died in an outbreak at a single Mount Airy nursing home. Officials in Montgomery County did not respond to similar requests Monday. Baltimore officials had said Monday that nursing home residents account for 20% of the city’s coronavirus deaths, but data posted on a city website Tuesday showed the rate to be higher. In announcing that the state would make the information public after all, Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement that transparency is “at the heart of our response to COVID-19.” Maryland is one of 15 states that has not made public detail about the prevalence of coronavirus cases and deaths in elder care facilities, according to data gathered by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said that while state health officials had legal reasons for keeping nursing home-level data secret, “given that we are in a crisis, and a fairly extraordinary situation, we are overriding those concerns in the interests of public health.” Anna Palmisano, director of Marylanders for Patient Rights, said she is glad to see more information released. But she said it’s most important that nursing homes follow guidance from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which has proposed requiring nursing homes to inform residents and their families within 12 hours of a positive coronavirus test at their facility. “That’s really important so that families and their representatives know,” Palmisano said. “Families are investing a lot of money so their relatives can be safe and the irony is, it’s the opposite that has happened.” Some nursing home administrators may be “unhappy” with the decision because of concerns the information will cause them to lose staff and residents, said Kevin Heffner, CEO of the LifeSpan Network, an association of nursing homes across Maryland and Washington, D.C. “Of course we’ll support what the governor is trying to do,” he added. At the same time, the information will help nursing home leaders who have been asking the state for lists of facilities that have confirmed coronavirus outbreaks because they say they need the information to help contain outbreaks. Many nursing home staff and contractors work in multiple facilities. Because visitation to nursing homes has been restricted since the pandemic reached Maryland, it is believed outbreaks have largely started with staff members, who in many cases may not be showing symptoms. A lack of testing for people who aren’t showing typical COVID-19 symptoms has increased that risk, said Morgan Katz, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University. Katz, who has been working with nursing homes on “strike teams” assembled by the state to address nursing home outbreaks, said investigations have backed up concerns about the asymptomatic spread. When she has helped conduct testing of all staff and residents at nursing homes, as many as two-thirds of people who have tested positive were not showing symptoms at the time of their test, Katz said. Such broad testing revealed an outbreak of 170 infections, including both residents and staff, at FutureCare Lochearn in Baltimore. But, Katz said, such large outbreaks are likely far more typical than is realized. “What we found is that in most of these facilities, if they had one or two symptomatic residents, it had spread really throughout the facility and we really weren’t capturing the asymptomatic residents,” she said. So Katz said she was not surprised to learn that nursing homes are accounting for such a large proportion of deaths in counties such as Anne Arundel and Baltimore. “We’re seeing these numbers really across the world and across the U.S.,” Katz said. “You have a highly vulnerable [population] in a group living setting. They are going to be at highest risk.” The information could help direct how resources and other assistance are provided to nursing homes during the pandemic going forward. Heffner said the nursing home industry is making the case to state health officials that a host of resources, equipment and attention given to hospitals to prepare for an expected surge should be shifted in part to nursing homes. “How about we take care of the people who are sick now, and figure out, if there is a [hospital] surge, how to manage that then?” Heffner said. Joe DeMattos, CEO of the Health Facilities Association of Maryland, said the data on nursing home deaths underscores a request his organization and two others sent Hogan last week, asking for a greater emphasis on coronavirus surveillance at nursing homes, regardless of residents’ or staff members’ symptoms, or lack thereof. “What they really need to do is get serious about testing,” he said.

Westminster man allegedly violated Maryland stay-at-home order, shouted he had coronavirus
.W
A Westminster man faces multiple charges after being caught violating Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home order, according to police. Anthony M. J. Simon, 32, of the 200 block of A Mandy Drive was charged with one count each of possession of a controlled dangerous substance that’s not marijuana, possession of paraphernalia for a controlled dangerous substance, equipment to administer controlled dangerous substance, resisting or interfering with arrest, disorderly conduct, failure to obey reasonable and lawful order, and violating state of emergency, according to online court records. Simon was released Tuesday on a $7,000 bond. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, also known as the novel coronavirus, Hogan issued a stay-at-home order on Monday instructing Maryland residents to not leave their homes after 8 p.m. unless for a necessary reason. According to charging documents, Westminster police responded to a call for two disorderly subjects, locating the duo, Simon and a woman, in the 30 block of Carroll Street in Westminster. Police warned them that they were in violation of the state executive order, the documents read. Simon and the woman said they understood and began to leave, but Simon then allegedly became agitated, screaming obscenities and yelling at the woman. Police tried to tell Simon again that he needed to leave and he told them he wasn’t going anywhere, according to the documents. The woman tried to calm him down and he yelled at her again. Police placed Simon under arrest but he tensed up, turned his body and attempted to yank his left arm free. While trying to place him under arrest, Simon repeatedly claimed that he had the coronavirus, police said. According to the documents, police searched Simon and found a syringe in his jean pocket that was attached to a gray shoe string and appeared to have residue of a cloudy liquid substance. Officers believed the residue to be heroin. Police restrained him and arrested him as he continued to resist and yell. Police placed a mask on him as a precaution. Simon removed the mask while handcuffed, continued saying he has the coronavirus and yelled a racial slur as an officer attempted to buckle him in, according to the documents. Once secured, Simon allegedly kept yelling and banging in the back of the vehicle. While officers were trying to get him out of the vehicle, Simon attempted to charge at them, police said, but he was secured in a restraint chair, where he made threats to spit on officers but made no attempts before police put a spit guard on him, according to the documents. The woman had not been charged as of Tuesday evening. Simon could not be reached for comment Tuesday, and no attorney was listed for him in court records. He has a court date scheduled for June 5.

Carroll County announces 18th death at Mount Airy nursing home, holds town hall on coronavirus response
.W
Two key coronavirus-related numbers for Carroll County on Thursday: 18 and one — the first because the day marked the eighteenth death of a resident of a Mount Airy nursing home, the latter because Carroll County held its first-ever virtual town hall meeting to answer community questions about the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is all about ensuring our citizens know up-to-date information on the process that everyone is working on and the ability to clear up some things they may be challenged with,” Wantz said. Beginning at 6:30 p.m. and ultimately running until just after 8 p.m., the town hall brought together Board of County Commissioners President Stephen Wantz, R-District 1, Sheriff Jim DeWees, Carroll Hospital President Leslie Simmons, Health Officer Ed Singer and Carroll County Public Schools Superintendent Steven Lockard, each joining the conversation by video conferencing and carried live on YouTube and Comcast Channel 24. But with the latest death of a resident of Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy — a man in his 60s with underlying health conditions, according to a county health department spokesperson — and the total number of confirmed cases in the county having risen to 205, there were many questions for the health officials on the call. Speaking to the health department’s response to the growing number of cases at nursing homes and long-term care facilities, Singer said that just as with cases in the community, it’s important to keep patients who did not require hospitalization out of the hospitals and manage them in place. “We are cohorting patients and trying to keep them in the same area and using a cohort of staff to deal with those patients,” he said. One resident of Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster has died, and another Carroll countian has died as well. At Carroll Lutheran Village, 21 residents and five staff members have tested positive, up from 18 residents and two staffers Wednesday. A total of 85 cases — up from 77 Wednesday — have been reported among people in the “community,” that is, not residents or staff of an elder care facility. Of those 85, 39 are women and 46 are men, while one is between the ages of 10 and 19; 17 are between ages 20 and 29; seven are between ages 30 and 39; 12 between ages 40 and 49; 33 between ages 50 and 59; 10 between ages 60 and 69; three between ages 70 and 79; and two between the ages of 80 and 89. At Pleasant View, 81 residents and 31 staff members have tested positive. COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, is particularly threatening to older populations and those with compromised health, so elder care facilities are of especially high risk. In response to a question about age and COVID-19, Singer said that given how new the disease is, it’s been very difficult to get good data about its effect on people. But he said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have suggested age and underlying medical conditions are the major factors in how severely people are impacted. “About 4 to 11% ... of adults in the age range of 65 to 84 years old ... die from the disease,” he said. “There are also estimates of 10 to 20% that are 85 or older die from the disease who are confirmed to have it.” The health department’s efforts have been focused on nursing homes and other similar facilities because older populations are at such a high risk, Singer said. Simmons noted that there are three different types of symptomatic COVID-19 patients from the hospital’s perspective: those who can stay at home and recover on their own, those who are moderately ill and may need some support at the hospital, and those who are quite seriously ill and will require a ventilator. “We have seven patients currently on ventilators,” Simmons said. “The great news is we have someone who came in quite critically ill, who had to be put on the ventilators … they just got off yesterday and they are doing good. It’s important we do understand that people can recover from this virus — even people who are critically ill can.” Carroll Hospital currently has 20 ventilators, Simmons said, with an additional 11 anesthesia machines that could be converted into ventilators if necessary. There are also further resources that can be pulled from LifeBridge Health, of which Carroll Hospital is a part, she told viewers. “LifeBridge in total has 508 ventilators, and we can move them across the system," Simmons said, “for whoever needs it most.” In preparation for a surge in the possible number of patients needing critical care, the hospital’s Shauck Auditorium has been converted into a 30-bed, negative pressure space, using special stretchers made available by the Carroll County Health Department, according to Simmons. “That setup is now ready and waiting, and I pray to God we never have to use it,” she said. “But if we do, it’s ready to go.” The Carroll County Agriculture Center’s Shipley Arena, meanwhile, has been surveyed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a possible temporary hospital site to expand surge capacity to treat COVID-19 cases, something that is still under consideration, according to Wantz. “We haven’t heard from [the Corps of Engineers],” he said, “but I want to assure people that if it would be used it would be self contained and there would be no danger, no clouds rolling over the City of Westminster.” “It’s not different than pulling the USNS Comfort [hospital ship] up to the New York harbor to take care of patients,” Singer added. The arena is “in an ideal location; it’s right near the hospital.” DeWees noted that people and businesses have been good about complying with the stay-at-home order from the governor and requirements of social distancing. While he has had deputies called out to Westminster City Pond several times, he said that Gov. Larry Hogan’s order allows for recreation and that, “They were staying away from each other.” “That’s a big area … where people can actually exercise,” he said. Law enforcement is still enforcing the law, DeWees noted, and his deputies are making arrests, but the crime rate is also down. “Most people think that crimes and crashes are up,” he said. “We are not seeing that in Carroll County. I compared numbers through the same time period last year … we’ve seen a slight reduction.” That being said, DeWees added that owners of businesses that are closed and considered nonessential during the pandemic are free to check in on their buildings, and are encouraged to do so. “I did get one other question about hunting,” DeWees said. “The good news is this is Carroll County and you can hunt if you are providing food for your family. I know there are some seasons coming up.” Lockard described successes the school system has had since the last in-school day on March 13, from distributing more than 6,000 meals to children a day to setting up thousands of virtual classrooms for remote learning. But, he said, everyone at Carroll County Public Schools is aware that everyone is at a different place when it comes to being able to help keep their children engaged in learning while school is out. “We get it, we understand,” he said. “We have no expectation of perfection, we know we simply cannot use distance learning to replace our traditional face-to-face learning.” Lockard asked parents to reach out to their children’s teachers and schools if they were having any problems or frustrations. While he said he was only speculating, he believed it very likely schools would continue to remain closed past April 24. Nationwide, as of Thursday evening, the coronavirus had resulted in more than 16,200 deaths in the United States out of more than 454,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic March 11. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Ravens, Stephen and Renee Bisciotti Foundation donate $1 million to local coronavirus relief efforts
.W
The Ravens and The Stephen and Renee Bisciotti Foundation have donated a combined $1 million to support four local nonprofit organizations with relief efforts during the coronavirus pandemic, the team announced Friday. The Baltimore-based Fund for Educational Excellence, the United Way of Central Maryland, the Baltimore Community Foundation and the Maryland Food Bank have each received $250,000, the Ravens said in a release. Bisciotti has been the team’s majority owner since 2004. “We want to help those in our community who are most affected by the COVID-19 crisis,” Ravens president Dick Cass said in the release. “We chose to donate through these four organizations because we are confident they will apply our funds quickly and directly to people in need. “We have worked closely with each of these organizations, and the life-altering work being done by them is incredible. We salute their dedication and the manner in which they continue to inspire and serve so many people.” As of Friday afternoon, Maryland now has 149 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the virus more commonly known as the coronavirus, according to Kata Hall, spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan. That’s up from 107 cases on Thursday.

Baltimore police already don’t have enough officers. What happens when they get sick from coronavirus? | COMMENTARY
.W
Public safety depends on the ability of our law enforcement agencies to continue to operate at full capacity at the least. Among other things, during the coronavirus pandemic that means safeguarding the health of front line employees and carefully monitoring for signs of infection, in order to prevent the transmission of the virus to other employees. This is even more critical in Baltimore in light of significant demands placed on the police department and the significant shortage of officers. Law enforcement organizations must maintain a state of operational readiness throughout this event. The most important ingredient to maintaining readiness is a healthy workforce able to deliver services that are absolutely essential to maintaining even a basic level of public safety. The Baltimore Police Department is particularly vulnerable to a loss of officers due to illness because it is already woefully understaffed by hundreds of officers and it faces a high volume of serious, violent crime. Maintaining even the minimum level of police protection in Baltimore will only happen if the police department takes unprecedented, proactive measures to protect officers and other essential employees from infection, then identifying and quarantining infected employees. Preventative measures put in place so far are insufficient to adequately protect these mission-critical first responders from acquiring and spreading infections to each other and members of the community. In short, the police department must become much more proactive about monitoring the health of its front line employees in order to minimize the risk of widespread infection. The centerpiece of the current strategy is responding to fewer routine calls and allowing officers to interact less often with potentially infected individuals. This is a good start, but it’s just not nearly enough. Very significant measures must be put into place now to manage the imminent risk to public safety presented by the widespread infection of police department personnel. Even a modest outbreak within the department could dangerously reduce police staffing in a city in which policing needs far outstrip available resources, even in the best of times. Internal leadership messages to rank-and-file employees have not indicated any plan to medically monitor employees’ temperatures or other early signs of infection, at regular intervals. Doing so could help prevent the rapid spread of the virus to other officers. Several days ago, the Miami Police Department began proactively monitoring even asymptomatic employees’ temperatures. Based on what little we know about this virus, any system that relies on employees’ assessment of their own health would be unreliable at best. According to officers I have spoken with, there have also been problems acquiring and distributing cleaning and hygiene supplies throughout the agency. The Fraternal Order of Police also recently confirmed that the police department is relying on a limited quantities of hand sanitizer and other protective equipment. The department must identify a sustainable source of quantities of hygiene and personal protective supplies to protect its employees and to prevent widespread infection. When COVID-19 tests are available, first responders and health care providers who become symptomatic, must be able to receive testing immediately. In light of the organizational risk to the police department, it is a disconcerting thought that there are no available alternatives to maintain the security of the city. While Gov. Larry Hogan has activated the Maryland National Guard, it is not a law enforcement agency and not able to assume the Baltimore department’s policing role. And unlike the response to the riots of 2015, county law enforcement agencies must remain in their communities, as they will all be facing the same challenges. The time is now to put out a call to recently separated Baltimore police officers to return, even if only temporarily, to help support the city and their comrades during this crisis. To the casual observer, it appears that the police department and city government leaders are crossing their fingers and hoping for the best, with little more than feel-good preparation measures. These measures largely ignore the elephant in the room — widespread infection of first responders and how to maintain continuity of service if that should happen. Based on what we have already seen abroad, hoping for the best just isn’t going to work this time. It is time to get very serious about the sobering challenges that lie ahead. Jason Johnson (jason@leldf.org) is a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department. Since January 2019 he has served as president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, which educates the public about risks to police officers and raises funds to defend wrongfully accused officers.

No ‘free pass’ on crime, violating executive orders during coronavirus crisis, Carroll County state’s attorney says
.W
While Baltimore police won’t be making low-level arrests and the city’s state’s attorney ordered her staff to dismiss certain low-level criminal charges during the current coronavirus crisis, Carroll County has no plans to follow suit. Carroll County State’s Attorney Brian DeLeonardo made it clear in a March 19 statement from his office that his staff “stands ready to enforce and prosecute all criminal laws of Maryland, any violations of the Governor’s executive orders in response to COVID-19, and any violations of orders for quarantine and isolation should that become necessary.” Gov. Larry Hogan has declared a state of emergency, and has issued several executive orders that prohibit gatherings and events of more than 10 people and close all restaurants, bars, fitness centers, enclosed shopping malls, movie theaters, bingo halls, and simulcast and off-track betting facilities to the public. “Any person who knowingly and willfully violates these orders is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment up to one year, a $5000 fine, or both,” according to the release, which goes on to say that individuals who are infected with the coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 disease it causes, or have been exposed to it and refuse to voluntarily isolate or quarantine can be ordered to do so by the local health department. Those who violate an isolation or quarantine order could face imprisonment of up to one year, a $3,000 fine or both. DeLeonardo was moved to announce this to the community in order to clarify some confusion based on actions taken by Baltimore City to not prosecute certain crimes, the release said. On March 18, Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby ordered her staff to dismiss pending criminal charges against anyone arrested for possessing drugs including heroin, attempted distribution of any drug, prostitution, trespassing, minor traffic offenses, open container violations and urinating in public, according to The Baltimore Sun. These crimes pose no risk to public safety and the defendants would be released before trial in normal times, she wrote in a memo to prosecutors. Additionally, Baltimore Police are encouraging officers to use discretion for low-level arrests to limit coronavirus exposure, department officials announced Thursday. The Carroll County State’s Attorney’s Office plans to take a different approach. “Now more than ever is a time for law and order — there is no ‘free pass’ because there is a declared state of emergency locally, statewide and nationally," DeLeonardo is quoted as saying in the release. “I fully anticipate that everyone accepts the gravity of the situation, and the part they must play in keeping their families and neighbors safe by following the governor’s orders. “At least in Carroll County, we will not allow this community to become a safe haven for criminals and lawbreakers seeking to capitalize on this state of emergency. We stand ready, willing and able to continue to prosecute the laws of the state, as well as any violations of Gov. Larry Hogan’s executive orders.” At least 107 people have confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday morning, though the third Carroll case was not included in that total. The first Marylander to die from the disease was a Prince George’s County man in his 60s, Hogan announced Wednesday night. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911.

These Baltimore businesses are collectively giving millions to coronavirus relief efforts 
.W
Businesses, large and small, have had to close their doors in a collective effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Monday morning announced additional measures to limit the COVID-19 outbreak, closing nonessential businesses effective 5 p.m. Monday. While the economic impact of prolonged closures is predicted to be drastic, it hasn’t stopped some of Baltimore’s most recognizable businesses from lending a hand during the pandemic. Here is a list of some Baltimore businesses and organizations that have donated money and resources to help fight the new coronavirus: T. Rowe Price What they’re giving: $540,000 to nonprofits and more than 160,000 N95 respirators What they’re saying: Funds will be allocated to the Fund for Educational Excellence, Emergency Artists Relief Fund, Center for Disaster Philanthropy and nonprofits in Colorado Springs, New York City, and San Francisco.

Baltimore Philanthropy What they’re giving: $1.2 million in funding What they’re saying: A group of eight funders in the Baltimore region announced on April 9 the COVID-19 Response Funding Collaborative of Greater Baltimore, a streamlined opportunity for nonprofit organizations to apply for funding to sustain, deepen, or pivot their operations to address critical needs in local communities resulting from the pandemic. SECU What they’re giving: $400,000 in grants and relief efforts What they’re saying: Announced on April 3 a commitment of $200,000 in grants to its members and an additional $200,000 in community relief efforts, including grants for nonprofits, donations to schools and United Way, and meal delivery to frontline medical workers. BGE, Constellation and Exelon What they’re giving: $1 million to relief organizations and small businesses What they’re saying: This is part of more than $5 million in donations in total by Exelon Corporation and its family of companies nationwide to relief organizations in support of communities impacted by the spread of the coronavirus. Weinberg Foundation What they’re giving: $4 million in emergency grant funding What they’re saying: The emergency grants will support current grantees that are providing vital services within their communities while facing severe operational challenges as a result of this pandemic. Sinclair Broadcasting What they’re giving: Multimillion-dollar emergency fund to help freelancers at two of its sports networks What they’re saying: Nearly 1,000 eligible freelancers at Fox Regional Sports Networks and Marquee Sports Network, the Chicago Cubs’ network, will be able to receive an immediate interest-free advance of $2,500 starting April 3.  Under Armour What they’re giving: $1 million each to Feeding America and Good Sports. What they’re saying: “It’s our mission at Under Armour to make athletes better, and in these unprecedented times we are even more committed to providing our communities with essential resources,” CEO Patrik Frisk said in a statement. "Through access to nutrition and fitness, we want to support the health and wellness goals that are being challenged at this time.” BGE What they’re giving: $175,000 to Maryland relief organizations, including the United Way of Central Maryland, the Maryland Food Bank and the Baltimore Community Foundation. What they’re saying: “BGE is committed to helping our community during this challenging time,” CEO Carim Khouzami said in a statement. “These donations and our continued partnerships with the United Way, the Maryland Food Bank, and the Baltimore Community Foundation are essential in efforts to help our customers address their needs during the COVID-19 health crisis. Getting through this requires everyone to lean in and do their part to lift up our community and help protect its most vulnerable members. We are grateful to support such worthwhile relief organizations making a difference in central Maryland’s pandemic response.” T. Rowe Price What they’re giving: $500,000 to global and local organizations, including $250,000 to the Fund for Educational Excellence to support food security issues for Baltimore City Public Schools students and their families What they’re saying: “This is a challenging time for families, entrepreneurs, the institutions that serve them, and our hearts go out to those most directly impacted by the coronavirus,” president John Brothers said in a statement. “It is critical we minimize the disruption in services on which our communities rely, and we’re pleased to partner with Baltimore City and other organizations to help minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” T. Rowe Price What they’re giving: More than 130,000 N95 masks What they’re saying: The masks were split between Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Maryland Medical System in Baltimore and UCHealth Memorial Hospital Central, Centura Health and Children’s Hospital Colorado Springs in Colorado Springs.

What they’re saying: “Motivated by the desire to help some of the most valuable members of the baseball community, each Club has committed $1 million,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. “The individual clubs will be announcing more details surrounding this support effort in their local communities. The timing of these announcements will vary because of the need to coordinate with state and local laws as well as collective bargaining obligations in an effort to maximize the benefits realized by each group of employees. I am proud that our clubs came together so quickly and uniformly to support these individuals who provide so much to the game we love.” CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield What they’re giving: $2 million to nonprofit organizations working to provide relief to communities during the pandemic, including the Baltimore Community Foundation. What they’re saying: “Now, more than ever, is the moment for empathy, urgency and corporate social responsibility. It is critical for organizations to join together and combine efforts during this time of uncertainty to help limit negative impacts to the people and communities we serve,” president and CEO Brian D. Pieninck said in a statement. “As a not-for-profit company, it has always been our commitment to serve not only our members, but individuals, families and communities throughout the region in pursuit of new pathways to improve health equity. We are honored to work with community organizations on the front lines to help ensure people’s short and long-term needs are met during this public health crisis.” Towson University What they’re giving: Nursing and biology department faculty are donating unused lab equipment, including syringes, medical gowns, face masks and gloves, to the University of Maryland St. Joseph Medical Center. What they’re saying: “We want to be as engaged as possible and working together to get through this,” biology professor Harald Beck said. “We know this is a time of shortage, so we just wanted to find a way to help the community. We’re hoping that we can work with other departments in the university and deliver more supplies.” M&T Bank What they’re giving: $100,000 to the Baltimore City Public Schools’ Fund for Educational Excellence to help feed the city’s students and their family members affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. What they’re saying: "We always are looking for ways to make a difference in the communities we serve — even more so at a time like this, Augie Chiasera, M&T’s regional president for Greater Baltimore, said in a statement. “Helping to alleviate the impacts the coronavirus is having on the young and most vulnerable is where we felt we could make the greatest difference in collaboration with the City of Baltimore and our corporate partners.”

Give Secretary Neall some credit for Md.’s coronavirus response | READER COMMENTARY
.W
During a time such as this when leadership is all the more important, some say government is all the same and it doesn’t matter who is there. Yet it does matter. It has always mattered. Now, it is ever more important. Why? Because the decisions being made literally will mean the difference between life and death. Maryland is fortunate in its leadership in two ways. First, there is a governor who actually listens to knowledgeable advisers while being respectful of the science behind the recommendations. And secondly, the state’s leadership is making decisions that result in the recommendations and concordant implementations that will help ensure our safety. The point person in Maryland is Secretary of Health Robert R. Neall (“Maryland coronavirus updates for March 16: Gov. Hogan issues series of executive actions to stop spread, bolster medical facilities,” March 16). I have known Secretary Neall as my representative in the Maryland House of Delegates, as a member of the Maryland Senate and as Anne Arundel County Executive. He is used to making difficult decisions. I am certain, however, that this event is decision-making on a whole new level and in truly uncertain times. As health secretary, he is responsible for bringing together relevant parts of state government necessary to making decisions about which critical actions to recommend, when they will occur and and how they will be implemented. From all indications and given the history of the coronavirus around the world, there will be deaths related to these decisions. The challenge: Determine which decisions will result in fewer deaths. Each decision may well have unfortunate trade-offs and I am sure each decision will weigh heavily on him. The people of Maryland should be confident in the state’s leadership responding to this threat. Given my age, I am in what is considered a high risk category of threat to life from the coronavirus. I know of no one I would rather having making decisions and recommendations than the current health secretary.

Prepare for the worst: Baltimore is vulnerable as coronavirus spreads | COMMENTARY
.W
Baltimore has entered the national health care discussion in the worst possible way. Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus task force, has identified Baltimore, along with Philadelphia and the District of Columbia, as the next potential coronavirus “hot spots," parts of the country where the epidemic is spreading uncommonly fast. It surely came as no surprise. The numbers have been growing and Charm City has long been regarded at risk in the same way that current hot spots New Orleans, New York and Detroit have already proven themselves — concentrated poverty and large numbers of older people with pre-existing conditions and living in close quarters. If COVID-19 is a possible wildfire, we are sitting on dry tinder. As much attention as the state and federal preparations for what’s coming next have garnered, this is a war that will ultimately be fought block by block, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood and not in the White House briefing room or even the halls of the State House. Have Baltimoreans gotten the message about social distancing? Can they recognize the symptoms of the virus? Do they know where to find testing? Where to get medical help? What happens to the homeless when the dry cough shows up and they have no place to turn? To long-term care facilities if staff come down with the disease? Can we even keep accurate data about where the outbreak has hit hardest as the numbers of casualties mount? On this subject, there is at least a glimmer of hope. Behind the scenes, Baltimore’s robust non-profit community, along with others in the private sector, have been rallying to buttress the city’s health department for an emergency on a scale that simply has no contemporary equal. This is not about calling in the National Guard. In many ways, it’s about calling in everyone: the Johns Hopkins Health System, the University of Maryland Medical System, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, MedStar Health, LifeBridge Health and on and on. Those involved are calling it a public-private partnership and it is unusual in its breadth and ambition because, frankly, it has to be. Turning the Baltimore Convention Center into a coronavirus field hospital, a key step in adding 6,000 hospital beds to the city’s inventory, has already demonstrated that these are not, pardon the expression, conventional times. If the pandemic is a war, the city’s response must turn on massively scaling up its supply chain. It’s not about heroics, it’s about logistics, it’s about coordination. The work of many is already bearing some fruit — an around-the-clock call center to advise people on health matters and resources and even schedule tests, a communications plan along with a public “dashboard” on the internet to get up-to-the-minute information, and outreach efforts to the “special” population that is most vulnerable such as the homeless who, should they show symptoms, may be eligible for temporary housing and support. These are programs that didn’t exist a few weeks ago. Not even on paper in many cases. Will it be enough? We don’t know. It’s impossible to predict with any certainty how bad things are about to get. But we are certain of this: Baltimore’s health department could not possibly have mounted this defense on its own. Nor could any single private institution for that matter. We are grateful to those who have taken on this thankless task of preparing for the worst, for a potentially massive increase in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Baltimore used to celebrate its “Old Defenders,” a terminology that dates back to the War of 1812. In the coming weeks, we are relying on the city’s new defenders to support the front lines in a battle that has already proven to be far more deadly than any fought at Fort McHenry.

Day in the Life: With baseball season on hold due to coronavirus, Orioles infielder Rio Ruiz bides his time
.W
Day in the Life is a series of occasional articles in which The Baltimore Sun looks at how Marylanders have been making their way through the coronavirus pandemic. Today: How Orioles infielder Rio Ruiz and the rest of the major league baseball players have had the start of their 2020 season suspended. Orioles infielder Rio Ruiz and the rest of the major league baseball players have had the start of their 2020 season suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no organized team workouts, so Ruiz continues to do his own strength training and cardio work to stay in shape. He often finds time to throw with teammates, such as Chance Sisco, whenever possible. After a strong second half last season, the 25-year-old Ruiz had hoped to pick up where he had left off, but the baseball shutdown has given him the opportunity to be a stay-at-home dad for a little while longer. He enjoys watching movies and listening to music with his wife, Michelle, and playing with his 9-month-old son, Luca, in Sarasota, Florida, as he waits to see when and if the baseball season will begin.

Few Maryland prisoners eligible for early release as coronavirus spreads behind bars
.W
As the coronavirus spreads in Maryland prisons, Baltimore defense attorney Natalie Finegar continues to receive phone calls from worried former clients behind bars. They hear people are being released from local jails because of the virus. Can they be freed from state prisons, too? “We tell them that we don’t really have a clear sense of what we can do inside the [Department of Corrections],” Finegar said. While prosecutors, public defenders and criminal justice advocates have called for the release of nonviolent offenders during the pandemic, the small number of inmates actually set free have come mostly from local jails — not state prisons where the virus has been more rampant. Two orders this week from Maryland’s chief judge, Mary Ellen Barbera, don’t change this: She encouraged the release of nonviolent youths and adults, instructing the trial courts to consider coronavirus a factor in decisions. But state’s attorneys say they already have been working to identify and set free the small number of men and women in local jails who qualify for early release. Meanwhile, state prison officials say the number of coronavirus infections has increased to 136 people who either serve time or work in 10 Maryland prisons. They counted the largest number, 40 cases, at the Jessup Correctional Institution. A prisoner in his 60s died of the virus there last week. Nearly 18,400 people are serving time or awaiting trial in state prisons, a department spokesman said. In general, these men and women are not candidates for early release because of the corornavirus. They are serving longer terms for more serious crimes. “People who are in the Department of Corrections aren’t here for shoplifting,” Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger said. “They either have a really bad record or they did a really bad crime." Whether in a state prison or local jail, inmates live together in close quarters, making precautions such as social distancing difficult. Since the virus spread in Maryland, inmates have become worried about their safety. Some have fashioned masks out of clothing; others have shouted out their fears from open widows. Coronavirus outbreaks have run rampant behind bars, sickening hundreds of guards and inmates in New York prisons, including the Rikers Island jail, and the Cook County Jail in Chicago. In Maryland, Shellenberger and other state’s attorneys have released some people awaiting trial or finishing a prison sentence in a local jail. Top prosecutors from Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties say they generally do not have the authority to intervene and set free the men and women serving time in state prisons. In most cases, there is no reason for these prisoners to be called back before a judge. An inmate must have filed a motion to modify his or her sentence, and such a motion usually must be filed within 90 days of a sentencing hearing. “The judiciary can act on cases that are in front of them, but they don’t really have a lot of power over cases that are not in front of them,” Howard County State’s Attorney Rich Gibson said. Instead, Gov. Larry Hogan and the Maryland Parole Commission have the power to release state prisoners. Members of the Parole Commission did not return messages through a spokesman. Hogan, meanwhile, has publicly expressed a reluctance to release state prisoners, saying “they’re safer where they are." Maryland’s Congressional delegation sent a letter to Hogan Thursday, urging him and the Parole Commission to identify and release state prisoners who pose no danger to the public. “The sharp increase in confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst the state’s prison population illustrates the need for more action,” they wrote. At a news conference in Annapolis on Friday, Hogan said he was “obviously concerned about potential outbreaks” in the prisons. But, he added, “I’m not sure how many more letters we need to get" about the issue. Of the state’s attorneys, Baltimore’s Marilyn Mosby alone has publicly called on Hogan to release prisoners. Her office also has recommended the courts release 114 people awaiting trial, about half of them for allegedly violating their probation. These people still will stand trial, Mosby said. Her office found another 40 people should be released early because they were within 90 days of finishing their sentence. “It’s a drop in the bucket,” she said, “which is why I’ve been calling on the governor to use his power and his authority to really make a dent in this.” Michael Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said Maryland was one of the first states to suspend all visits to state prisons, volunteer programs and intakes from the local jails. Authorities also are distributing face masks to state prisoners, he said. “With every decision the governor makes, he has in mind the health and safety of Marylanders, including our incarcerated population,” Ricci said. Meanwhile, in Baltimore County, Shellenberger said his staff has reviewed cases of everyone held at the local jail who is older than 60, locked up for a nonviolent crime, or suffering health problems. They decided to release between 50 and 75 people. County jails are generally smaller than state prisons and vary in size, from as many as 1,300 people in the Baltimore County Detention Center to between 200 and 300 at the Harford County Detention Center. In Anne Arundel, State’s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess said her office conducted its own review and released at least 40 people awaiting trial. Howard County’s Gibson released four people, his spokeswoman said. Carroll County State’s Attorney Brian DeLeonardo said his office released about 45 people. And Harford County State’s Attorney Al Peisinger Jr. said he knew of no releases, but he’s allowing people serving weekends in jail to postpone the start of their terms.

Coronavirus is so contagious it warrants two-week quarantine, CDC and Johns Hopkins experts say 
.W
How contagious are people? When are they spreading the virus? These are the questions scientists and public health officials are asking as the novel coronavirus outbreak spreads further every day. Definitive answers remain unknown, but the virus appears to be easily passed and the two-week quarantine period that has become standard is reasonable, according to researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Johns Hopkins University looking at available data. “China describes this as being highly contagious, and there essentially is no immunity against this virus in the population because it’s a new virus,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a Monday news conference. “It’s fair to say that as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States either this year or next year will be exposed to this,” she said. “And there is a good chance many will become sick.” People are potentially contagious longer than those infected with the flu or common cold, according to a Johns Hopkins study published Monday afternoon. The median time, or halfway point, between when people are exposed and develop symptoms is just over five days, and most people are back to normal after two weeks, said Justin Lessler, an associate professor in the Bloomberg School of Public Health’s department of epidemiology and the study’s senior author. Most likely won’t become seriously ill from the respiratory disease caused by the virus, named COVID-19. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Messonnier said 80 percent appear to have mild illness. Another 15 percent to 20 percent become more seriously sick. At highest risk are people over age 80 and with underlying health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, though younger people with health issues also are at greater risk. The virus doesn’t appear to be a significant threat to children. People likely are passing the virus before they show symptoms, Lessler said. They are certainly more contagious while they are actively sick because they are coughing out droplets that contain virus onto their hands and surfaces where others can pick them up. That is why officials recommend people wash their hands and avoid touching their face. And for COVID-19, that’s why the CDC recommends they quarantine themselves for two weeks. “Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of 14 days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable, although with that period some cases would be missed over the long term,” Lessler said. There will be people who develop symptoms and remain contagious after being released from the 14-day quarantine. Lessler said the number would be about 101 people for every 10,000 cases. He said extending the quarantine period likely wouldn’t be practical because two weeks already is a significant amount of time for people to leave behind their normal lives and their day jobs. Lessler said health care workers could end up quarantined in larger numbers because of their exposure, and taking so many off the front lines could be detrimental to fighting the virus. Quarantines have consequences. An absence of firefighters or police could endanger public health in other ways. Teachers keep schools operating, which in turn allows parents to go to work. And so on, he said. “Particularly at this point, it’s not necessarily the goal of quarantines or active monitoring to make sure every case develops in that period,” he said. “You have to balance costs and benefits.” About 97.5 percent of people who develop symptoms of COVID-19 do so within 11.5 days after exposure, the Hopkins study found. The incubation period is similar to that of other serious coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS. It’s longer than the coronaviruses that cause the common cold, which is about three days, and the flu, which is about two days. The study, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, looked at 181 cases from China and other countries where exposure dates and development of symptoms were known. Lessler said studies will continue as more data becomes available. There are more than 113,000 cases of COVID-19 globally, more than 600 in the United States in 34 states. There are six cases reported in Maryland.

Baltimore judge irks prosecutors by holding court and accepting pleas during coronavirus
.W
Even with schools, offices and restaurants closed by the coronavirus, Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn was on the bench Tuesday morning to hear guilty pleas. This continued business required the presence of lawyers, clerks and other courtroom staff — leading city prosecutors to urge Phinn to suspend her busy docket for risk of spreading the virus. Michael Schatzow, the chief deputy state’s attorney, asked Phinn to close her docket of reception court. He noted an order Monday from Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera to close courts across the state except for emergency operations such as bail reviews. Later Tuesday, she reaffirmed her position by announcing in a message that she would continue to hear guilty pleas through April 3. All other cases are postponed. Phinn did not return a message to her chambers. Instead, a spokeswoman for the courts provided a statement from the administrative judge. Circuit Judge Audrey Carrion wrote she decided to continue reception court so defendants aren’t left waiting in jail. “It is our responsibility to address those cases that may result in plea deals that would result in the defendant returning back to the community,” she wrote. Prosecutors have expressed frustration that such hearings continue despite the pandemic. In a letter to the court Friday, Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby wrote that her prosecutors worried about appearing in the busy reception court. The docket was designed to streamline cases and free up other courtrooms for trial. Phinn handles dozens of guilty pleas, postponements, and other routine matters that don’t require a jury. Each day, lawyers hurry in and out. The cases proceed at rapid pace. “In light of the fear and anxiety that my prosecutors have all expressed in not only appearing for work but appearing in Reception Court, which is arguably a breeding ground for the spread of this exceptional virus, my office is operating with a skeletal crew,” Mosby wrote. The coronavirus has disrupted or closed public offices across Maryland. Offices of the public defender closed, too. Chief Judge Barbera shutdown all courts and court offices. She ordered each jurisdiction to keep on hand enough judges to hear emergency matter, including arraignments, juvenile detention hearings and bench warrants. On Saturday, U.S. District Judge James Bredar ordered the federal courthouse in Baltimore shutdown except for emergencies. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in Maryland continues to rise. State officials now say at least 57 people have confirmed COVID-19 infections. Gov. Larry Hogan has closed bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms. He has also postponed the elections, banned congregations of 50 or more people, and declared a state of emergency.

David Driskell, prominent authority on black art, dies from coronavirus complications 
.W
FALMOUTH, Maine — David Driskell, one of the nation’s most influential African American artists and a leading authority on black art, has died. He was 88. Driskell was a multimedia artist who used the trees around his Falmouth, Maine, cabin home as a feature in his work. A spokeswoman for the David C. Driskell Center at the University of Maryland said he died on Wednesday. University officials said Saturday his death, in a hospital near his home in Hyattsville, Maryland, was due to complications related to coronavirus. Driskell went to Maine in the 1950s to study at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. He was part of a wave of artists who came to the state from New York, the Portland Press Herald reported. He would go on to become the author of several books and more than 40 catalogs, curating ”Two Centuries of Black American Art: 1750-1950” at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the 1970s. The show was pivotal in paving the way for the study of African American art history. Driskell once said of Maine: "I dream about it when I’m not there.” The spokeswoman for the Driskell Center said services are not planned at this time due to concerns about coronavirus, which has disrupted funeral services around the country.

To prevent strain on hospitals amid the coronavirus pandemic, this Towson firm created an ‘E-Triage’ device
.W
When patients enter a medical emergency room, one of the first steps to treating their illness is triage. Health care providers assess their condition and assign priority levels for their care. Medical systems worldwide are facing the same challenge during the coronavirus pandemic, “that we need to be able to decentralize care,” said Dr. Sarah de Ramirez, vice president of clinical innovation at Illinois-based OSF HealthCare. Struggling against a national shortage of supplies, medical systems have been scrambling to roll out solutions to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus to other patients within hospitals and to prepare for the expected surge in coronavirus patients that could overburden facilities. A mobile app developed by a Towson medical technology firm could help reduce the number of in-person hospital visits for coronavirus and other illnesses by at least 20%, its chief technology officer estimates. StoCastic, a business start-up that began at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 2016, designed the “E-Triage” tool to enable health care providers to triage patients over the phone in order to prioritize their level treatment, including where they are treated, using artificial intelligence. The app is being rolled out this month through the Pandemic Health Worker Program at OSF HealthCare, which purchased the electronic tool. The goal of the Illinois program is to pare hospital visits by treating patients with COVID-19 in their homes through digital monitoring kits, de Ramirez said. E-Triage helps determine the severity of a patient’s symptoms and “which direction in the health care system they should go” by assessing that patient’s vulnerability to COVID-19 complications based on underlying health conditions and medical history, their risk of in-hospital mortality, the patient’s demographics and other factors, said Scott Levin, StoCastic’s chief technology officer and an associate professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins. The tool is being applied for lower-risk patients, John Vozenilek, vice president of OSF HealthCare, which operates 13 hospitals in Illinois, said in a statement. For those patients, "health care workers will be sent to the patient’s home for further assessment, follow up, and testing,” he said. Through the program, health workers will drop off kits that include computer tablets and hand sanitizer to monitor quarantined patients for 14 days, the amount of time recommended by health officials for those who have been exposed to the virus. The E-Triage tool is the first piece of the Pandemic Health Worker Program, de Ramirez said. The program is expected to serve about 8,400 patients in their homes each month, according to OSF HealthCare. The system also could be used to signal and predict “hotspots” — areas where COVID-19 cases have proliferated — allowing health care units to mobilize more quickly in those areas, de Ramirez said.. A version of the app is already being used in Johns Hopkins Medicine emergency rooms for in-person visits, Levin said. The firm is in preliminary discussions with state health officials to start using the E-Triage tool in Maryland health care systems, but that “those discussions are ramping up,” Levin said.

Vigliotti: The Constitution matters more than ever during an emergency such as the coronavirus crisis
.W
There are two divergent modes of thought on the quarantine due to coronavirus. There are some who believe we cannot risk being too safe; and there are those who feel we are doing ourselves more harm than good. The truth is there is a point at which things can go too far. Both perspectives are reasonably grounded. Those who seek a sustained shutdown are concerned about a worsening of infection and mortality rates, while those who seek a resolution to the lockdown are troubled by personal, social, economic, and constitutional reasoning. Most Americans seemed willing to respect social distancing, quarantining, and employing protective measures early on – voluntarily. After all, who wanted to risk getting sick from a virus that was largely unknown in our country? Everyone wanted to do what they could to help, even if it was staying at home, using 3D printers to produce personal protective equipment, sewing masks, donating food and more. Carroll County residents have been extraordinary in their generosity. Even when the first rounds of mandated shutdown occurred, most Americans were willing to listen because they wanted to flatten the curve of infections, and because there were set periods of time for those shutdowns. They knew things would be tough, but were willing to take on their role. But two weeks of quarantine became three or four; and then suddenly the winter became the spring, and the amount of virus information — sometimes seemingly contradictory — surged. Meanwhile, thousands have died. More than 800,000 Americans are known to have contracted the illness. More than 20 million Americans have gone out of work. The economy is ruptured. Friendships, families, and love have been strained by isolation. Americans are not unfamiliar with sacrifice. During World War II, for example, food, gasoline, electricity, and more were rationed in order to conserve and provide for the war effort against tyranny. Indeed, a lot of comparisons were made between early experiences with coronavirus and the second World War. The analogy goes only so far. It’s one thing to find that the local grocery store doesn’t have toilet paper or that you can’t go out to dinner for your birthday. It’s another thing entirely to be arrested in front of your child at a playground for violating quarantine restrictions. When Americans see this, they know their elected leaders have gone too far in their legal prescriptions. The difference between the two perspectives over quarantine has become divisive. Some of those who favor a sustained quarantine have wished death on those who don’t; and some of those who don’t have accused those who do of statism. It is wrong to cheer for the death of fellow Americans who want the country reopened, and there are some — like the governor of Michigan — who have taken quarantine to an extreme. Americans are hurting. President Trump’s call for a safe reopening of the economy and society recognizes this, approaching the problem from a commonsense, middle ground. Many of America’s governors are realizing this as well. The governor of Georgia is slated to begin opening up his state this weekend, while our own governor is set today to begin stepping back restrictions with urging from Carroll’s delegation. Meanwhile, Carroll’s commissioners have stepped forward to reopen the landfill. It is important to remember that no sincere elected leader wants to be responsible for an order that causes harm in terms of human life or human freedom. What were initially intended to be practical safety measures have stirred a necessary debate about constitutional rights as many of those measures have become excessive, and a critical discussion about the long-term health of the United States is directly related to it. As Attorney General William Barr and others have rightly noted, constitutional rights don’t disappear in an emergency, whether it is during wartime or pandemics. The Constitution is especially crucial in moments of trial and uncertainty, because it is then that who we are and what we believe in is not only in practice, but matters most to us as individuals. If what we cherish cannot withstand an emergency, how can we expect it to withstand the peace? In common law countries like the United States, what is past is prologue — and precedents will shape the future. The experience of internment camps during World War II, for example, meant that in subsequent wars, such as the war on terror, internment camps were never utilized. We can learn and grow from our present circumstances, too, and we can counter the excesses. Barr has indicated that the Department of Justice could side with American citizens suing over such extreme cases — and the DOJ should. Part of preparing for the next pandemic means not only stockpiling medical supplies and equipment, but evaluating social and legal protocols under such an occasion. Being safe and being free are not mutually exclusive. We will get through this. Joe Vigliotti, a contributor to The Flip Side and a Taneytown city councilman, writes from Taneytown.

Baltimore comes close to meeting April 1 deadline for eliminating 311 backlog, even hampered by coronavirus
.W
When Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young stood at the mouth of a trash strewn alley in late January and vowed to eliminate the city’s steep backlog of 311 cleaning requests by April, he knew he faced some challenges. But he couldn’t have predicted that by mid-March, he would have to suspend much of the Department of Public Works’ operations in response to the rapidly escalating coronavirus pandemic. His signature “Clean it Up!” campaign, a widespread effort to reduce grime across Baltimore, had to be put on hold, just like almost everything else. Still, members of his administration say they’re heartened by the progress they were able to make in plowing through overdue requests for dirty alley and street cleaning before their April 1 deadline. “In this moment in which we’re all frantically trying to deal with the coronavirus, I wanted to mark the achievement of workers at DPW and other agencies who made this happen,” said Sheryl Goldstein, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff for operations. Residents were waiting on more than 17,000 overdue cleaning and property maintenance work orders in September. By January, city crews whittled the backlog down to roughly 7,500. And as of this week, there were only about 260 overdue requests for cleaning an alley or street. The city managed to get the number of late requests for overgrown weeds down to zero, said John Chalmers, head of the city’s Bureau of Solid Waste. On March 23, the public works department suspended “nonessential” services like bulk trash pickup, rat abatement and alley cleaning to preserve resources and keep more employees safe. “Instead of going a few more days to get to zero, we made decision in the best interest of the city and department to stop the services to focus on what we needed to focus on in this time,” Goldstein said. Depending how long the city remains in a state of emergency due to the public health crisis, Goldstein said, workers might have to do another “blitz” to clear out whatever backlog accrues. “This is an opportunity for us to really implore residents to keep our city clean,” she said. “We need to protect our workers, and we need to make sure we have enough workers to be picking up trash and recycling every day.” Chalmers said that his agency, like those around the country, is struggling to keep up with the demand for protective gear, though he said staff still has access to it. “We have wipes and hand sanitizers coming in,” he said, “but it’s a challenge to keep up because we utilize these materials everyday.”

Plans for Howard Community College commencement that was postponed due to coronavirus unveiled
.W
Howard Community College on Monday released preliminary plans for its Class of 2020 graduation that was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The rescheduled commencement is currently set for Aug. 21 at the UMBC Event Center in Catonsville, with Dec. 20 as a backup date if necessary, according to a statement from HCC President Kate Hetherington. The original graduation, which was set for May 22, was postponed by the college on March 20. The recognition ceremony for nursing and allied health students, which has been separate in the past, will also occur on the same date as the regular commencement this year. HCC will make an official decision about which date will be used at the beginning of the summer, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Homan. “We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to hold commencement on Aug. 21, but if things do not improve and large-scale events aren’t allowed, then we would use our fallback date of Dec. 20,” Homan said. “The reason for that is we don’t really know what the situation is going to be with holding public events, especially a large-scale event like a commencement. That’s why we thought it was important to hold two dates and not just one date.” The two dates, Homan said, gives the college flexibility to have as few conflicts as possible. The August date is before most students start classes at HCC — or transfer institutions — and the December date is during when HCC and most colleges will be on winter break. While some colleges and public school systems have opted for virtual commencement ceremonies, Homan said it was important to Hetherington and her leadership team to reschedule the celebration for a later date rather than host it online. “We recognize that our graduates deserve the best commencement possible,” Homan said. “We knew with [a virtual ceremony] they wouldn’t be able to have that same experience with their friends and families.” HCC also recently announced it will be continuing virtual learning through the summer. The summer session, which begins in May, will be completely online, Homan said. “We haven’t made a decision yet on the fall,” she said. All events at the college have been canceled through at least June 30.

Harford 911 operators screening for coronavirus over phone, sheriff’s office taking precautions
.W
Though Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler is not familiar with any of his deputies coming into contact with anyone who tested positive for the novel coronavirus sweeping through Maryland, his office and the county’s dispatch service are taking steps to ensure the safety of personnel. The sheriff’s office, Gahler said, has an increased presence at its southern precinct in Edgewood, where it is taking reports of some lower-level crimes over the phone — no personal contact necessary — to decrease the chances of deputies getting sick. The telephone reporting unit is being staffed by school resource and community policing officers. Harford County’s emergency services are also asking 911 callers a question to screen them for any possible sickness and prevent first-responders’ exposure to the virus. Director of Governmental and Community Affairs Cindy Mumby said 911 operators are now asking callers if anyone on the scene of an incident has a fever or has been coughing, so law enforcement and other first responders “know what the situation is [they] are entering into.” If they answer yes, Mumby said, callers are directed to keep themselves and others away from the person in question, and first responders are equipped with personal protective equipment — gloves, gowns, masks and eye-shields — when they respond. “We do that to alert first responders that they could possibly be exposed to coronavirus,” Mumby said. Even in view of the pandemic, deputies still have to do their jobs, Gahler said, which puts them in close contact with people. "We have a service to provide … but we are trying to figure out how to provide that services with as little citizen/deputy contact as possible,” he said. “With this outbreak, we want to limit the exposure of our deputies.” All deputies are equipped with personnel protective equipment — N-95 masks, rubber gloves and eye protection — and though Harford’s sheriff’s office is “adequately” staffed, there is a national shortage of the protective equipment, Gahler said. Most of the protective equipment was purchased in years past to protect deputies from exposure to fentanyl, the synthetic opioid responsible for many overdose deaths, but can be just as easily used for viral protection. “You are trying to keep something as small as a grain of salt from being inhaled,” Gahler said of fentanyl. Keeping the virus away from deputies is the same in principal. Though county residents should not expect a loss of service, Gahler said, the office is worried the self-sequestration recommended by the CDC could spur overdoses while people wait out the virus at home. “That certainly concerns me,” Gahler said. The office has not seen an uptick in domestic violence reports that some have speculated could arise from people being stuck in their homes, Gahler said, though it is a fluid situation. “Sometimes people, I guess, they are cooped up together and don’t know how to tolerate individuals too long … necessitating a police response at inopportune times,” he said. “We have not seen it. I hope we will not see it.” Local law enforcement agencies, Gahler said, are also responsible for enforcing Gov. Larry Hogan’s ban on gatherings of 10 or more people. Previously, the governor banned gatherings of 50 or more people; on Thursday he dropped the number to 10 or more. Gahler said the citizens of Harford County are treating the virus seriously and keeping off the streets. As of Thursday, gatherings of 10 or more people are temporarily chargeable misdemeanors and carry a penalty of one year in jail, a $5,000 fine or both, according to the governor’s Thursday order. “I’ll be shocked if we have to charge anyone through this,” Gahler said, before adding, “I’ve been shocked before.” The Harford County Detention Center is also a cause for concern, Gahler said. No cases have been confirmed there, but infection could ripple through the closely housed population if introduced there. For that reason, the jail adopted screening guidelines for incoming arrestees and people reporting for weekend detention, checking their temperature on arrival, isolating inmates with a temperature higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately notifying medical personnel, who will check the inmate for other symptoms of COVID-19. Between March 5 and 19, the jail processed 131 new inmates and 66 have been released, sheriff’s office spokeswoman Cristie Hopkins reported. Gahler said that deputies at the jail are also having their temperatures taken. As of Thursday, the virus has sickened 107 Marylanders and killed one Prince George’s County man in his 60s.

Maryland prepares for coronavirus amid conflicting directions from federal officials and President Trump
.W
As countries across Asia and Europe continue to report new coronavirus cases, and more than four dozen cases are logged in the United States, Maryland officials say they are preparing for what might come. Gov. Larry Hogan confirmed Thursday that two Maryland residents were being tested for the virus. The officials outlined their readiness after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned states and residents to start making plans for inevitable cases, though President Donald Trump denied at a Wednesday news conference that there was much of a threat. He said the risk remains low because of steps taken to close the border to potentially infected visitors. “I don’t think it’s inevitable,” Trump said after announcing he had put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of overseeing further preparedness and pointing to a Johns Hopkins index that showed the United States to be well-positioned for a health threat. “It may get bigger and may not get bigger at all.” The Maryland officials, however, said planning had been ongoing since well before the CDC made its recommendations. In hospitals, schools and businesses and at the Maryland Department of Health, which is coordinating the state’s response, officials are relying on what’s known about this virus and outbreaks of other viruses, including the flu, which is currently widespread in the state and country. “The State’s preparedness builds on decades of planning, experience and expertise gained from previous public health events such as SARS, MERS, H1N1, Zika and Ebola,” said a statement from the health department about the new disease, called COVID-19. The health department said it “continues to coordinate across all state and local agencies and to regularly provide COVID-19 guidance to the state’s physicians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and local health departments.” Two people in Maryland have tested negative for the virus since it first appeared in the United States earlier this year. But the planning continues, given public health warnings that the virus could become a pandemic, meaning the outbreak has spread globally. The CDC warned Tuesday that the virus likely would continue spreading to the United States and that preparation is necessary. Individuals should be prepared for cancellation of events, closing of schools and orders to quarantine at home if there is extensive “community spread,” meaning it’s unclear how patients became infected. The first suspected case was reported Wednesday in California. “I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the head of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Unlike during the last pandemic that heavily affected the United States, the 2009 H1N1 flu, there isn’t likely to be a vaccine ready to prevent spreading COVID-19 this year, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease doctor and scientist for the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health in Baltimore. He was a principal investigator on the vaccine trials for the H1N1 pandemic, also known as swine flu, and Chen said a vaccine was ready in months. Scientists prepare a new flu vaccine every year with new strains and there is an established system. A vaccine for the coronavirus is in the works, in part through the work of University of Maryland researchers and based on an existing coronavirus vaccine; however, it’s unlikely to be ready this year, partly because there is no established system or manufacturers at the ready, Chen said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said as much during the Trump news conference. He said a vaccine could be used if there is a new outbreak next year, though a treatment could be ready this year. Chen said the state and federal governments will need to rely on other methods that some may find “draconian" if the outbreak becomes a pandemic. “We need to be very transparent with the public and tell them why we are doing these things,” Chen said. “Some may interpret them as draconian and others may say they sound reasonable. But there will be no public trust, or cooperation, without transparency that starts early on.” He said that’s what the CDC intended with its comments, to ensure such measures don’t come as a shock if they are needed. Chen said there are several possible scenarios with the virus. One is that the virus is contained through measures such as travel bans and quarantines overseas before it’s widespread in the United States. A second is that it continues over weeks and months into a pandemic that is far harder to contain. And a third is that the infections abate in warmer weather, much like the flu, then return with a larger wave in the fall. Others in Maryland are preparing for any scenario in which many people here are infected. Hospitals are laying out plans to operate with fewer medical staff and send office staff home to telework, said Dr. David Marcozzi, who is in charge of COVID-19 preparedness for the University of Maryland Medical System. Hospitals already were prepared to quarantine patients, but now there are protocols to care safely for COVID-19 patients, who could grow rapidly in number. They also are evaluating circumstances in which health professionals could forgo masks, gloves and other protective equipment so they can be stockpiled, as supplies are becoming low. (Masks, the doctors noted, shouldn’t be stockpiled among the general population because they only help prevent spread from someone already infected and are unlikely to protect people from becoming infected.) “We know this will be coming to Maryland. The question is how large of an impact will it have,” said Marcozzi, also associate chair of population health in the Maryland medical school’s department of emergency medicine and assistant chief medical officer for acute care at the University of Maryland Medical Center. “Our plan not only speaks to care for our patients, but our facilities,” he said. “Everyone needs a plan: schools, businesses, community leaders, city and state leaders. Things like telework don’t happen overnight. You need to plan, steps need to be in place when we realize there is significant disease burden in our community, though we hope it doesn’t get to that point.” It’s the same story at local schools, where officials said they are coordinating with local health officials. “We are very closely monitoring the development of the virus,” said Charlie Herndon, a spokesman for Baltimore County schools. “It’s a matter right now of getting as much information as we can.” Filipa Gomes, supervisor of health services for the Carroll County schools, said officials are emphasizing precautionary measures similar to those used to prevent the spread of flu — such as washing hands with soap and water and coughing into a tissue. The Baltimore City school system is following the direction of the state health department and has handed students a fact sheet in English and Spanish, said Gwendolyn Chambers, a schools spokeswoman. The Howard County Public School System has developed an infectious-disease response plan to deal with flu that will be used, according to spokesman Brian Bassett. Some schools could close, as they did in 2009. Acting on recommendations from the CDC, then-Gov. Martin O’Malley closed several schools where students were suspected of being sick with H1N1. The University System of Maryland also began preparations before the CDC recommendations. Presidents of the 12 campuses were briefed last week by University of Maryland Baltimore experts, said Joann Boughman, the senior vice chancellor for academic and student affairs. “If the people in leadership feel they are prepared, then it brings down or helps reduce the fear and eliminates the sense of panic," she said. "I think continuous calm but substantial communication is one of the greatest assets we might have.”

Sleuths at National Center for Medical Intelligence at Fort Detrick in Maryland tracked, warned of the new coronavirus
.W
In late February when President Donald Trump was urging Americans not to panic over the novel coronavirus, alarms were sounding at a little-known intelligence unit situated on a U.S. Army base an hour's drive north of Washington. Intelligence, science and medical professionals at the National Center for Medical Intelligence were quietly doing what they have done for decades — monitoring and tracking global health threats that could endanger U.S. troops abroad and Americans at home. On Feb. 25, the medical intelligence unit raised its warning that the coronavirus would become a pandemic within 30 days from WATCHCON 2 — a probable crisis — to WATCHCON 1 — an imminent one, according to a U.S. official. That was 15 days before the World Health Organization declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. At the time of the warning, few coronavirus infections had been reported in the United States. That same day, Trump, who was in New Delhi, India, tweeted: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA." Soon, however, the coronavirus spread across the world, sickening more than 2 million people with the disease COVID-19 and killing more than 26,000 people in the United States. The center's work typically is shared with defense and health officials, including the secretary of health and human services. Its Feb. 25 warning, first reported last month by Newsweek, was included in an intelligence briefing provided to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but it's unknown whether Trump or other White House officials saw it. Various intelligence agencies had been including information about the coronavirus in briefing materials since early January, according to the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to confirm details about the alert. At least 100 epidemiologists, virologists, chemical engineers, toxicologists, biologists and military medical experts — all schooled in intelligence tradecraft — work at the medical intelligence unit, located at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. Requests to interview current workers were denied, but former employees described how they go through massive amounts of information, looking for clues about global health events. “You feel like you’re looking for needles in a stack of needles," said Denis Kaufman, who worked in the medical intelligence unit from 1990 to 2005 and again later before retiring. Most of the information they study is public, called “open source” material. A local newspaper in Africa might publish a story about an increasing number of people getting sick, and that raises a flag because there’s no mention of any such illness on the other side of the country. A doctor in the Middle East might post concerns about a virus on social media. But unlike organizations such as the WHO, the medical intelligence team, part of the Defense Intelligence Agency, also has access to classified intelligence collected by the 17 U.S. spy agencies. The medical unit can dig into signals intelligence and intercepts of communications collected by the National Security Agency. It can read information that CIA officers pick up in the field overseas. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency can share satellite imagery and terrain maps to help assess how a disease, like Ebola or avian flu, might spread through a population. “Every day, all of us would come into work and read and research our area for anything that’s different — anything that doesn’t make sense, whether it’s about disease, health care, earthquakes, national disaster — anything that would affect the health of a nation,” said Martha ”Rainie” Dasche, a specialist on Africa who retired from the DIA in 2018. “We start wondering. We look at things with a jaundiced eye.” They don't collect intelligence. They analyze it and produce medical intelligence assessments, forecasts and databases on infectious disease and health risks from natural disasters, toxic materials, bioterrorism as well as certain countries' capacity to handle them. Their reports are written for military commanders, defense health officials and researchers as well as policymakers at the Defense Department, White House and federal agencies, especially the Department of Health and Human Services. The center was originally in the U.S. Army Surgeon General’s office during World War II, but military leaders throughout history have learned the hard way about the danger that disease poses to troops. “In the Spanish-American War, there were major epidemics of typhoid fever and dysentery,” according to a report written in 1951 at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. “World War I saw widespread outbreaks of influenza and malaria. In World War II, there was a high incidence of malaria and infectious hepatitis. ... In all wars prior to World War II, losses from disease exceeded losses from battle injury.” Today, the team's success comes in providing early warnings that prevent illness. That can be difficult if a country doesn't report or share information out of fear that the news will affect its economy or tourism. Some undeveloped countries with poor health systems might not compile good data. Information from countries trying to play down the seriousness of an epidemic can't be trusted. Kaufman said massive amounts of information come out of China, where the first reports of the new coronavirus surfaced in the city of Wuhan. But because the country is run by an authoritarian government, the medical intelligence researchers glean information from the local level, not Beijing. “Researchers, in some cases, have more success in learning information from the bottom up — not from the central communist government, but from localities,” he said. “That’s where some guy in Wuhan might be saying ‘I can’t report this because I don’t want to look bad to my boss’ or there’s a guy who says he can’t talk about avian flu because his cousin runs the bird market and doesn’t want to hurt his business.”

Maryland works to expand coronavirus testing, but not yet for the general public
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday that Maryland is expanding testing for the new coronavirus by taking steps including collecting samples at several drive-thru sites. But weeks after the first cases were confirmed, the general public still can’t drive up and request a test, according to state officials and those doing the testing. A doctor’s order is necessary. “Testing is only for individuals with physician orders who meet specific protocols from the Centers for Disease Control and the Maryland Department of Health,” said Michael Schwartzberg, a spokesman for the University of Maryland Medical System, which is the latest to begin testing patient samples outside the state-run lab in East Baltimore. The protocols call for testing of hospitalized patients with symptoms, and symptomatic people outside the hospital who are considered high risk, include those in nursing homes, in long-term care facilities or who have underlying health conditions. Medical personnel, health care workers and first responders with symptoms also are being tested. Those with mild symptoms of the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus are encouraged to notify their doctor but isolate themselves and self-treat at home unless they start having trouble breathing. Health experts believe there are many more cases than those currently confirmed by testing. Testing remains limited because the state continues to face a shortage of testing supplies, said Fran Phillips, deputy state secretary for public health services during a morning news conference at which Hogan issued a stay-at-home order for everyone in the state. “The availability and speed for COVID-19 testing is an absolute health care industry priority across the country,” Schwartzberg said. The university health system now can perform some diagnostic testing at five of its 13 hospitals, including the flagship University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore and others in Cheverly, Glen Burnie, La Plata and Towson. Its capacity is expected to continue growing as supplies increase, officials said. The system’s Upper Chesapeake Medical Center was also among the first to open a drive-thru station to take swabs for testing. John Hopkins Hospital began diagnostic testing about two weeks ago, and others, including LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are testing samples collected at Maryland hospitals and elsewhere in some of its labs. The state Department of Health reported Monday that Maryland had run fewer than 15,000 tests for the related disease COVID-19, confirming infections in just over 1,400 people in a state with a population of about 6 million. The relatively slow pace of testing is not unusual in the United States, where testing has lagged behind some other countries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bungled development of the initial test and catching up there and at private labs has been slow as supplies have been limited. Since the first three cases were confirmed March 6, testing has shown about 45% of the state’s 1,413 cases as of Monday have been in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. Hogan noted in Monday’s conference that the cases are not all among seniors. He said 51% of all positive cases involve people who are age 50 and younger and 56% of hospitalizations involve people younger than age 60. To prevent more cases, Hogan has joined several other states ordering most everyone to stay home and away from others who could be infected and do not know. Many people are asymptomatic and others don’t show symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath for days. “This virus and this disease is sneaky,” Phillips said. “What you do today, what you do tomorrow, matters.” It’s unclear when the availability of testing will expand, which health officials consider important to understanding the virus and how to stem its spread. More expansive testing would help “situational awareness,” said Justin Lessler, an associate professor in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s department of epidemiology. That means understanding just how much disease is out there or how much was out there. He said that can help show policymakers whether social distancing fails to stem the spread and whether other measures are necessary, something that should be clear in two to three weeks as those who are just infected become sick enough to head to the hospital. Widespread testing also can show that measures are working and restrictions can be lifted. Then testing could be used to aggressively identify people who are infected so they, and anyone they’ve come in contact with, could be isolated rather than the public generally, Lessler said. “We’re not there yet,” he said of widespread testing. “I know capacity is building fast." While the state is now releasing more data on how many tests are being performed, officials haven’t said how fast testing is expected to ramp up. Johns Hopkins began testing about two weeks ago, and it’s now testing about 500 to 600 samples a day, with results in about 24 hours, said Dr. Karen Carroll, director of the division of medical microbiology at the Hopkins School of Medicine. She said supplies of materials for testing are sufficient and she expected the lab to reach 1,000 a day in the next week. Hopkins had hoped the lab also could offer more rapid testing on other platforms, however, “kits are in high demand and inventory is low,” Carroll said. Most hospitals are now able to take samples to send to labs. The samples taken at the state’s drive-thru sites will add to the workload at those labs. The sites include Motor Vehicle Administration emissions stations in Bel Air, Glen Burnie and Waldorf, as well as another at FedEx Field in Landover. They, too, will be “strictly limited” to those with doctor’s orders and an appointment, Hogan said.

Trump’s irresponsible endorsement of malaria drug for coronavirus treatment boils the blood | READER COMMENTARY
.W
There have been no completed scientific controlled studies for the efficacy of the drug hydroxychloroquine as an effective preventive medication for COVID-19 (“Fact check: Trump pitches unapproved drug for coronavirus,” April 5). Yet President Donald Trump continues to tout it and has suggested that he might even take it himself. As an autoimmune patient myself (fortunately, not dependent on hydroxychloroquine), I have seen the suffering of patients with diseases that depend on this medicine. As other writers to this paper have elaborated, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can cause tremendous pain and totally restrict daily activities. And then these diseases, uncontrolled, can attack major organs. Now, there is already a severe shortage of hydroxychloroquine in the United States and long-term patients cannot get their supply. I am beyond angry over our leader’s promoting the drug before scientifically controlled studies are released. Surely, the proven needs of patients already severely suffering should come before healthy people relying on thinly-studied unproven reports. It is unconscionable!

Anderson, a cellist who performed with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra for more than three decades and was also a keyboardist and music teacher, died of the coronavirus April 13 at Sun Valley Assisted Living in Westminster. The former longtime Pasadena resident was 89. “Eva was fantastic. She could play anything that was put before her,” said Bob Kennick, a percussionist with the BSO from 1948 until his retirement in 1988. “She also did piano orchestrations. She’d put down her cello, go play the piano, and return to her seat and pick up her cello.” “She played the cello and played it well,” said Don Tison, former principal BSO trumpeter, who retired after 31 years with the orchestra in 2000. Missie Zaraya, a BSO violinist for 47 years before retiring in 2014, said: “Eva was a great sort of old-school musician who was reliable, hardworking, loyal and always pleasant to be around. She also played the keyboard and whenever they needed a keyboardist, she was always willing and able to do that.” The former Eva Mathews Frantz, daughter of Luther M. Frantz, a civil engineer, and his wife, Eva Ness Frantz, a private piano teacher, was born in Baltimore and raised on Oakley Road and later Everton Road in the city’s Pimlico neighborhood. Something of a child prodigy, she began playing the piano when she was 6 years old under the guidance of her mother, who was a Peabody Institute graduate, and later added the cello, while at the same time composing pieces. By 1939 she had composed 15 pieces. “As for her pieces, Eva just plays them. Her mother will be in the kitchen and hear a new, unusually simple tune. She will come back in and ask, ‘What’s that you’re playing?'" The Sun reported in a 1939 article. “The reply often is, ‘Why mother, that’s my new piece.’ Eva says she 'just hears’ the tunes in her head of course. One of the most unusual is her ‘Song of the Radiator,’ which she wrote after hearing one at her home.” After she had attended her first symphony concert, she went home and wrote her first piece, “Wake Up Sally. It’s Time to Get Up.” Other youthful compositions included “In the Woods,” “Spring Makes the Flowers,” “The Grasshopper,” “Butterflies,” “March of the Tin Soldiers” and “Waltz.” She was 8 years old when BSO conductor Werner Janssen performed her “Go to Sleep My Teddy Bear” at the first young people’s concert of the 1939 season at The Lyric. "Eva takes the bear to bed with her every night, and the song she wrote was a lullaby, “Go to Sleep My Teddy Bear.' Yesterday the bear was dressed in a colorful gypsy costume,” The Sun reported. Brought to the stage where she received the applause of an appreciative audience, as the orchestra prepared to repeat the lullaby, young Eva instructed them to play it “very softly,” reported the newspaper. “That was one of her favorite music memories,” said a daughter, Marty Dunbar, of Highland. A 1948 graduate of Eastern High School, she completed her education at the Peabody Institute where she earned a teacher’s certificate in piano, harmony and violoncello. In 1954, she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in music, piano and supplementary subjects. In 1958, she earned a master’s degree in violoncello, also from Peabody. “While she was in high school she received a three-year scholarship to the Peabody. She also had a one-year piano scholarship at the conservatory, and in 1957 received the Harold Randolph Prize for achievement during the period of study,” The Sun reported in a 1958 profile. “She and I were taking a class together at Peabody and little did we know it at the time that we would have professional musical careers,” said Mr. Kennick, an Owings Mills resident. “I admired her keyboard tactics and she could innovate like crazy. I told her I wish I could do that, and she told me she admired my rhythm patterns. I guess we had a mutual admiration society.” According to the 1958 profile, “Just as her musical tastes range from Bach to jitterbugging, her other interests range from the serious to the light.” She told Philip Greenfield, a Sun contributing writer, in a 1989 interview: "The music of Bach that I studied as a keyboard player gave me a genuine understanding of the way music fit together, once I began playing in orchestras. I remember at Peabody that I’d get so caught up listening to the unfolding of the music that I’d totally forget to come in and play my part.” Mr. Kennick described her as being “a little laid-back but friendly. We got along very well.” In 1954, she married John Meredith “Andy” Anderson, a surveyor for the old State Roads Commission, who was very supportive of her music and career, family members said. He died in 2006. Mrs. Anderson auditioned for the BSO in 1961 and at first was told there were no openings, then a position soon opened and she was invited to fill it. “She hesitated taking the job,” her daughter said. “My father pushed her to go to the BSO and do what she loved.” Mrs. Anderson soon added the keyboard to her role with the symphony where she performed from 1961 until retiring in 1995. In her retirement, she periodically served as a substitute. Mary Plaines, a Tuxedo Park resident, who had been principal BSO orchestra librarian and is now secretary-treasurer of the Musician’s Association of Metropolitan Baltimore, said of Mrs. Anderson: “She was a warm and generous person and people remember her very fondly, and music was her life.” Ms. Dunbar said, “One of the highlights of her career was accompanying Metropolitan Opera soprano Beverly Sills." Another career highlight was being a part of the BSO’s 1987 European tour. “A lot of us remember that 1987 tour to Europe,” Ms. Plaines said. “She and her husband, Andy, were with us.” “We would get time off to go sightseeing and I remember me and my wife spending a delightful day exploring Vienna with the Anderson’s,” said Mr. Tison, formerly of Parkville, who now lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. In addition to her work with the BSO, she played with the York and Gettysburg symphonies, in trios and quartets. She also taught music at Peabody and in her home. When she was a young woman, she had been the organist and choir director at the Glyndon United Methodist Church and for 30 years, was the organist at the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Annapolis. The former Timonium resident and her husband who later moved to a home in Pasadena that overlooked Bodkin Creek and where they enjoyed entertaining family and friends at summertime crab feasts, as well as BSO colleagues and artists. “My father was so supportive of her career that he did all of the cooking because she didn’t know how to cook,” Ms. Dunbar said. “I remember trying to explain to her while doing some baking that a stick of melted butter was a half a cup.” In 2017, Mrs. Anderson moved to Sun Valley Assisted Living. “One of the big selling points of her going there was that she could take her piano and organ,” her daughter said. “Her piano and cello were in her room and the organ was in the common room where she performed for fellow residents and guests. She was also organist for their church.” Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, plans for a memorial service are incomplete. In addition to Ms. Dunbar, she is survived by another daughter, Marie Burnham of Summerfield, North Carolina; four grandchildren; and 18 great-grandchildren.

Will Baltimore’s Little Italy survive the coronavirus? Here’s how some restaurants are coping.
.W
Ray Alcaraz has been eating well during the pandemic. Homemade ravioli at Chiapparelli’s, the meatballs from Joe Benny’s, lemony veal piccata from Aldo’s, and of course, cannoli from Vaccaro’s: Alcaraz, who grew up in Little Italy, is on a one-man mission to patronize the neighborhood’s restaurants in crisis. “I have gone to almost every restaurant to get a meal and I’m still not done,” said Alcaraz, president of the promotion center for Little Italy. There’s not much else to do but eat, these days, here, or anywhere else. The bocce court is empty, and so is the church, though the Italian tricolor bunting still hangs overhead, primed for celebration. “I sit on the corner with a couple of the neighborhood guys and watch nothing,” said Alcaraz. "The only activity is the food delivery people.” In a time when the pandemic is devastating restaurant businesses, ground zero in Baltimore is the nine-square-block patch of downtown where generations of Italians have made their home, and their livelihoods. The close-knit community has weathered crises from the Great Fire of 1904 to civil unrest in the 1960s and rising competition. Restaurants are Little Italy’s backbone. With the oldest dating back to the 1940s, the mostly family run eateries here have changed little in recent decades, even as other areas of the city morphed into dining hot spots. Now, the abrupt end to dine-in service brought by the coronavirus has forced many into the 21st century. Some places are offering specials and advertising through Instagram. They’re making use of delivery apps and are appealing to the loyalty of longtime customers. Others are creating videos as part of #KeepTheLightsOn, the Maryland comptroller’s campaign to support local businesses. In a video shared on Facebook, Dominic Vaccaro demonstrated his technique for “wrangling” cannoli. Standing in front of a barn door he dubbed the “Vaccaro ranch,” he lunged after the tawny cannoli shell and trapped it beneath a cowboy hat. The concept was lighthearted, but Vaccaro closed with a message that was decidedly more serious: “We’ve been in business 64 years. Don’t let this be our last.” The day before Easter, the Vaccaro family packed up their famous desserts, driving around the region as far as Silver Spring to deliver their cannoli, a first for the pastry shop. They didn’t make a profit, but they got their treats on customers’ holiday tables for another year. “Tradition is so hard to keep as it is,” said Dominic’s mother, Maria, whose Italian born father-in-law started the family business years ago. Some old school customs have already taken a hit. St. Joseph’s Day, March 19, is usually a time to eat Vaccaro’s sfinci di San Giuseppe, a doughnut filled with ricotta. But this year, the coronavirus’ arrival put an abrupt halt to sales. A few restaurants are taking out personal loans to make payroll, and hoping that state and federal loans will come through for them. Dan Stewart, who runs Isabella’s Brick Oven with his nephew, is trying to avoid laying people off. “I’m borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.” He’s hoping for relief from the Paycheck Protection Program. Amiccis owner Scott Panian expanded the restaurant’s catering and delivery business after the unrest of 2015, when many customers became unwilling to venture downtown. His sales have dropped more than 50 percent — but the early preparation for carryout has helped. In recent weeks, staff have used social media to aggressively market daily specials — three courses for $20 or “two dinner Tuesdays.” Amiccis also uses apps like Uber Eats and Grubhub to deliver to customers. While some have criticized such companies and the hefty commissions they charge, Panian said he needs that business to survive. But even the carryout business comes with baggage. While the company takes precautions, it’s hard not to worry as he hands off bags to customers. “You feel this guilt as an owner. Am I putting people at risk?” Panian said. “You go home and put on the news and you worry about it.” Many are counting on the appetites of longtime customers. At Sabatino’s, regulars have come from as far as Baltimore County to pick up orders. “Our really good regulars I’ve seen every week,” said manager Lisa Morekas. Carryout business still doesn’t come close to pre-pandemic sales, but Morekas is undaunted. “We had a strong business going into this nightmare,” said Morekas, whose great Uncle Joe started it in 1955. “We have loyal customers. That's all you need.” Located across from what was once the bustling President Street train station, the neighborhood today called Little Italy became “100 percent Italian” in 1920s, says historian Suzanna Rosa Molino, author of Baltimore’s Little Italy: Heritage and History of The Neighborhood. Italian immigrants like Morekas’ grandparents — many of whom had come to the U.S. together — lived in boarding houses there, gathering for weekly mass and celebrations at St. Leo’s, built at Exeter and Stiles streets in the 1880s as an all-Italian parish. It was “the neighborhood that had everything you needed in 9 square blocks,” said Alcaraz, who lives in Lutherville, but comes back every day to the neighborhood where he grew up. When Alcaraz was a kid in the 1960s and 70s, there was a pharmacy, sandwich shop, butcher and funeral home. His parents still reside in the house where his mom was born. To outsiders, perhaps the biggest draw were the neighborhood’s restaurants. Yale history professor Paul Freedman charts the rise of Italian-American cuisine in his book “Ten Restaurants That Changed America.” He found that these restaurateurs dropped traditional ingredients like organ meat and invented dishes like spaghetti and meatballs to accommodate American tastes. Such eateries were meant to appeal not to fellow immigrants, but to bohemian city dwellers of the era. “They’re not as fussy,” Freedman said. “They’re not going to say, ‘My grandmother in Amalfi makes this better than you.’” In the 1920s, Neapolitan baker Pasquale Chiapparelli opened a bakery on High Street where he sold some of the first pizzas in Baltimore. The bakery later became a restaurant; an ad for it in The Baltimore Sun explained in parentheses that pizzas were “Italian tomato pies.” Today, Chiapparelli’s is the neighborhood’s longest running eatery, though the menu includes much more than pizza. Before the Inner Harbor, Harbor East, Canton and other city neighborhoods developed their own dining scenes, Little Italy was more or less the only game in town. At Sabatino’s, regular guests included Little Italy’s most famous residents, the D’Alesandro family. “Tommy the Elder” — the father of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — was Baltimore mayor. Pelosi’s late brother, Thomas J. D’Alesandro III, “Tommy the Younger” served in that role too. In the 1970s and 80s, there were more than 20 eateries in Little Italy. Vince Culotta, Morekas’ father and owner of Sabatino’s, remembers that as the heyday. He enlarged the dining room at Sabatino’s from 125 to 250 and later 450 seats. Recent years have seen numerous closings: Boccaccio closed in 2008 after the death of its owner; Vellegia’s, once the oldest restaurant in Little Italy, shuttered the same year. In 2013, Caesar’s Den, Rocco’s Capriccio and Della Notte all ceased operations. In January, so did Da Mimmo. With just a handful remaining, many believe the pandemic will kill even more. “I don't think everybody’s going to survive it and that’s scary,” said Panian. Though he’s determined to shepherd Amiccis through the current crisis, he’s aware of just how different the future could be. Will he ever use his upstairs dining room again? He’s not sure. Across the country, 40 percent of restaurants are currently closed due to the pandemic, according to a recent survey from the National Restaurant Association. In Maryland, that amounts to 4,500 businesses. Freedman predicts up to half will close permanently, with older diners reluctant to go out and younger diners lacking the funds to do so. In his book, “Burn the Ice: The American Culinary Revolution and Its End,” James Beard Award winning author Kevin Alexander argued that the restaurant industry in the United States was oversaturated. He predicted a recession would close up to 30 percent of eateries that were already in a financially tenuous situation. In light of the coronavirus, he now places that percentage at 40-50 percent. “It’s going to be a real struggle,” he said. Yet some Little Italy institutions may be uniquely poised to weather the storm. While recent years have seen a dining culture dominated by Instagram and the quest for the latest trend, the aftermath of the crisis may see diners seeking out comforting and familiar foods they’ve eaten for years. “It was all about new, new, new for so long,” said Alexander. Post pandemic, diners may care less about innovative cuisine, and more about the people making their dinner at their favorite neighborhood spot. And in Little Italy, nostalgia is always on the menu. At Sabatino’s, old fashioned lace curtains adorn glass windows. The bookmaker’s salad, overflowing with shrimp and salami, tastes the same today as it did when it was invented in the 1970s — even when ordered for carryout. So does the cannoli at Vaccaro’s. It’s a consistency that produces both eye rolling and admiration. “We’re often criticized for doing the same old thing,” said Morekas. “That's who we are. That's what we do.” Regardless of the coronavirus, Morekas has no plans to stop. “When it's a family business, it’s your life. It’s your name,” Morekas said. “I’ve been here since 1983, what else am I going to possibly do at this stage of my life?” Her father, Vince Culotta, agrees. When anyone asks him about the future, he gives the same answer: “I’m going to sell spaghetti — no matter what.”

Most Baltimore-area hospitals halt elective surgeries to ease strain on resources amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
More Baltimore-area hospitals and medical and dental offices are postponing elective procedures after the nation’s top doctor asked facilities to consider halting them as new coronavirus cases spread. On Tuesday, March 17, Kaiser Permanente and MedStar Health were the latest to announce they are canceling certain procedures. Kaiser offices are rescheduling non-urgent surgeries and other procedures and health assessments for the coming weeks in anticipation of demands on the health care system from COVID-19. Kaiser, which is expanding in Baltimore, also plans to add six walk-up and drive-up testing sites at its medical centers and to expand telehealth services and mail in pharmacy services. “As the COVID-19 situation rapidly advances, the demands on the nation’s health care system threaten to exhaust supplies, equipment, and our people, said Machelle Behzadi, Kaiser’s vice president of quality and safety. In a statement, MedStar said it’s postponing all elective procedures and surgeries starting Thursday. “Our department leaders and our physicians will make case-by-case decisions using the specific clinical circumstances of each of our patients,” the hospital system said in a statement. This comes after Johns Hopkins Medicine, the University of Maryland Medical System and Lifebridge Health announced Monday that they will postpone elective procedures for two weeks starting Wednesday. Hopkins, UMMS and Lifebridge have multiple hospitals in the region. Also starting Wednesday, officials at Anne Arundel Medical Center near Annapolis and Doctors Community Hospital in Lanham said they will “limit our surgeries and procedures to emergencies or urgent cases only." They plan to reassess the decision every 72 hours. Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson canceled elective procedures beginning Tuesday. The Maryland State Dental Association also said Tuesday that it was recommending all practices in the state voluntarily suspend non-essential dental care for at least three weeks, following guidance from the national organization. The group also said more stringent and mandated restrictions are possible. Over the weekend, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams said on Twitter that continuing with elective procedures could expose facilities to the virus, overtax medical staff who are needed to respond to the pandemic, and use up reserves of personal protective equipment needed for health care workers. “Hospital & healthcare systems, PLEASE CONSIDER STOPPING ELECTIVE PROCEDURES until we can #FlattenTheCurve!” Adams wrote. In his Twitter post, Adams cited new recommendations from the American College of Surgeons that say hospitals should “thoughtfully review all scheduled elective procedures with a plan to minimize, postpone, or cancel” them until it’s clear the health care infrastructure can handle “a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.” Another issue is the availability of beds to treat those with the COVID-19 illness who need hospitalization. The state has about 8,000 acute hospital beds of which 1,200 offer intensive care. That’s fewer than most expect will be needed. Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday morning that the state is attempting to open up another 6,000 acute care beds. Tinglong Dai, an associate professor of operations management and business analytics at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School, said that for hospitals, “the stake at hand is not just resource limit, it is also about being part of the broad effort to ‘flatten the curve’ through social distancing.” “Hospital-acquired infections are another important concern,” he said. “From what we have seen from the rest of the world, particularly in Wuhan, China, quite a lot of patients were infected while seeking elective care in large hospitals at the early stage of the outbreak.” GBMC said in a tweet Sunday night that it’s canceling the elective surgeries to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and because it’s “consistent with the CDC’s recommendations.” UMMS announced its decision Monday, saying it will review the policy in two weeks. It made the move to minimize the risk of exposing patients and staff to the virus and “to ensure adequate availability of supplies and equipment that can be redirected to the care of COVID-19 patients,” said Dr. David Marcozzi, the system’s COVID-19 incident commander, in a statement. At Hopkins, officials said Monday that their policy “will be reassessed routinely over this period of time to determine if it should be modified in any way or extended.” LifeBridge, too, said it would reevaluate every two weeks and noted that the suspension does not apply to urgent or emergent procedures. The changes affect Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Northwest Hospital, Carroll Hospital, Levindale and Grace Medical Center, but not its Surgicenters in Owings Mills and Ellicott City. Baltimore Sun reporters Meredith Cohn and McKenna Oxenden contributed to this article.

Baltimore leaders ask state for more help ensuring food is accessible during coronavirus shutdowns
.W
Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young and East Baltimore Del. Stephanie M. Smith are asking Gov. Larry Hogan to put more state resources into making sure food is available for those who need it during the coronavirus pandemic — including a new system to allow participants in a federal food assistance program to purchase food online. A Hogan spokesman said the federal government has not approved a statewide system to purchase food online, but is looking to speed up a pilot program in development. Baltimore City estimates a third of its residents will qualify for federal food assistance in the coming weeks as businesses suspend operations and furlough or layoff workers during the coronavirus pandemic. The city’s projection is based on the past five years of unemployment data and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, said Holly Freishtat, the city food policy director. Currently, 166,000 city residents participate in SNAP each month. A total of 200,000 residents used SNAP when the unemployment rate was 7% in 2015, and Freishtat said the city could exceed that within 30 days. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last April that Maryland and six other states would join New York State in a pilot program in which SNAP recipients could purchase groceries online. Baltimore has spent years trying to launch its SNAP pilot, but it’s been delayed “due to federal and state technological issues,” according to a March 31 letter Young sent Hogan. “My request will likely significantly increase the workload for Maryland’s [electonic benefit transfer] processor ... yet, as you’ve repeatedly stated and shown, the response to the Coronavirus pandemic requires aggressive actions,” Young wrote. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said the USDA has not approved online SNAP use statewide. However, he said, the state Department of Human Services “is exploring the feasibility of accelerating the current implementation schedule" of Baltimore’s pilot due to the pandemic. Baltimore City has provided over 250,000 meals at 100 meal sites like recreation centers, schools, and public housing over the past two weeks, according to a letter Smith sent Hogan on Sunday. Even so, Smith said food relief organizations face “unprecedented demand with a dwindling volunteer base.” She told The Sun older adults and disabled residents, who depend on others to help them shop, “have pleaded for help.” Maryland’s confirmed number of coronavirus cases exceeded 4,300 Tuesday. Public services have been restricted and Hogan has closed nonessential businesses. He also issued a stay-at-home order in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. The federal government’s $2 trillion response package is expected to give some SNAP participants more funding than usual in April and May, said Michael Wilson, director of Maryland Hunger Solutions, but people who already receive the maximum SNAP benefits likely will not receive more money. Ricci said the state Department of Human Services is providing more than $66 million in additional SNAP benefits to over 319,000 Maryland households in response to COVID-19. The additional funding comes after 84,000 Marylanders filed for unemployment in March, according to the state Department of Labor. Smith, an assistant director in the city’s Department of Planning, said the online SNAP pilot would give eligible households the ability to stay home and order food without exposing themselves to the virus. Smith also said she’s “deeply concerned that a lack of state coordination and financial support” to address food insecurity will leave Baltimore residents stuck in their neighborhoods without enough food. Calling hunger “one of the most biologically desperate states you can be in," she stressed that hunger has led to “civil unrest around the world.” The state Department of Human Services has been targeting a fall 2020 launch for the online SNAP system, according to Young’s letter. Wilson said he supports online SNAP use, but he thinks Maryland’s program won’t be ready until 2021. “While we have pressed [state government] to do as much as they can as fast as they can, I am not optimistic that online SNAP is going to get done in 2020,” Wilson said. SNAP benefits don’t cover delivery fees, for instance, and Wilson said he doesn’t want SNAP recipients to deal with out-of-pocket costs from online expenses. Wilson said companies like Amazon and Walmart need to waive delivery fees for Maryland SNAP purchases, as they’ve done in other pilot states. Meanwhile, phone calls for SNAP application assistance have “dramatically increased” at Wilson’s organization since the pandemic began, he said. Wilson said applying for SNAP online can be complicated for people who have difficulty with, or no access to, technology, and local Human Services offices are currently closed. Marylanders seeking online SNAP application assistance can call Maryland Hunger Solutions toll-free at 1-866-821-5552. Smith also urged Hogan to establish an emergency food budget prioritizing support for jurisdictions with the highest concentrations of food insecure residents. Additionally, Smith asked the governor to direct the Maryland National Guard to commit more soldiers to support food distribution to communities where food is needed. Only "a fraction” of the soldiers present are being used for food distribution, she said. “People always need to eat, but we also want to reduce their interactions with one another, so whatever we can do to get food to people that can last a longer period of time can also reduce their need to have to leave their home,” Smith said.

Maryland nursing homes ask Gov. Hogan to allow all their residents and staff to be tested for coronavirus
.W
Maryland’s nursing homes are asking Gov. Larry Hogan to use a surge of 500,000 coronavirus tests obtained from South Korea to conduct universal testing on all of their residents and staff. Testing has remained limited for anyone who isn’t showing symptoms of COVID-19 infection, but who are believed to have introduced the virus to vulnerable elderly populations. The leaders of three nursing home industry groups, the Health Facilities Association of Maryland, LifeSpan Network and Leading Age Maryland, say that has made it difficult for nursing home administrators to “proactively manage their communities.” “While we understand the challenges associated with testing asymptomatic individuals, waiting for both employees and residents to develop symptoms almost guarantees additional infections,” they wrote in a letter to Hogan. Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci said “all options are under consideration” as the state moves to roll out increased testing, noting that the governor on Monday said the surge of new tests would go to “high-priority areas, such as nursing and group homes.” Nursing homes in Maryland and around the country have been hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Maryland officials have said coronavirus cases have been confirmed in 169 of the state’s 226 nursing homes, and that 74% of the people the virus has killed in the state are age 60 or older. The state has declined to provide lists of nursing homes with confirmed outbreaks, however, or to break down how many of those deaths have involved nursing home residents. Health officials have said that it was an asymptomatic staff member who sparked the outbreak at Pleasant View nursing home in Mount Airy, where more than two dozen residents have died from COVID-19. And it was universal testing of residents and staff, sought out by nursing home operator FutureCare over concern about possible asymptomatic spread of the virus, that revealed an outbreak infecting at least 129 residents and 41 staff members at FutureCare Lochearn. At least two residents there have died, according to family members. The nursing home groups told the governor that facilities “have been left to contract with labs on their own for testing, a challenging and frustrating endeavor, but one deemed necessary to protect staff and residents.” Hogan recently secured enough equipment to test 500,000 people through a deal with South Korea that the governor said his wife, Yumi Hogan, largely negotiated. He called it “an exponential, game-changing step forward on our large-scale testing initiative.” This article will be updated.

State ‘strike team’ deployed to Cecil County nursing home as additional coronavirus cases confirmed, county officials say
.W
A Cecil County nursing home is preparing for spike in new coronavirus cases and has called in a state “strike team” to battle the disease’s spread, which has proved deadly at other nursing facilities. “What started out as two isolated cases two days ago has now infected other residents and staff" at the Calvert Manor Health Care Center in Rising Sun, said Cecil County Executive Dr. Alan McCarthy at a news conference Saturday. County officials were alerted Thursday after two residents tested positive. Since then, additional residents and staff have tested positive, and additional test results are pending and more testing is underway, officials said. A total number of positive cases at the facility was not available Saturday. No deaths have been reported at the facility, and no residents or staff from the facility have been hospitalized, according to County Health Officer Lauren Levy. A state “strike team” of healthcare workers from local hospitals and National Guard members have been dispatched to the facility. Additionally, county officials said the health department and Christiana Care Health System are working to make sure the facility has enough masks and other personal protective equipment. Testing, however, will be limited. “Unfortunately, the testing availability remains limited and we have to be strategic in our use of testing kits," Levy said. At least 90 such nursing homes have confirmed cases of the virus in Maryland, including one the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Carroll County, which has experienced at least 18 deaths and dozens of other infections among residents and staff. State officials have not said how many of the state’s more than 200 coronavirus deaths were tied to nursing homes, but many victims have been elderly. “I am deeply saddened this disease has spread to a location which houses some of our most vulnerable citizens,” McCarthy said. Cecil County has had one death and 74 cases.

Baltimore Police: Southwest District station reopened after deep cleaning that followed positive coronavirus test
.W
Baltimore Police Department’s Southwest District station reopened Monday after all employees were ordered to self-quarantine this past weekend when an officer tested positive for the coronavirus, one of eight police employees who’ve contracted the disease. Department spokeswoman Chakia Fennoy wrote in an email Monday that the building at 424 Font Hill Ave. has reopened “after the building and all cars associated with the district were sanitized over the weekend.” The department said 94 officers have been cleared to return to work while 40 Southwest District officers continue to self-quarantine. There are 120 officers throughout the department who are self-quarantined. Mike Ricci, spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan, wrote on Twitter on Monday that Maryland State Police Col. Woodrow Jones III “has offered more resources to Commissioner Harrison” and the department “in response to the issues in the Southwest District.” “Our troopers and MD Transportation Authority Police officers are continuing their regular patrol assignments in Baltimore City,” Ricci wrote. “Troopers work patrol in areas of need as directed by BPD command staff.” Police announced late Saturday that the district had been closed after an officer assigned to the district tested positive for COVID-19, commonly known as the coronavirus. In a news release Sunday, the department said that the officer was one of eight police employees — six officers and two civilian employees — who have tested positive for the coronavirus. In addition, 219 employees are out while they self-quarantine, the department said. “The department continues to adjust and modify the delivery of police services to meet the evolving demands [of] the COVID-19 response,” the department wrote. “The safety of our members and citizens continues to be our top priority during this critical time, and we continue to take the necessary steps to protect our members and the community.” As of Sunday, 305 officers and employees have been quarantined for some time, including 133 officers at the Southwest District. Eighty-two officers and four civilian employees have since returned to work, the department wrote. The release came after the department announced late Saturday that the district building would be temporarily closed after at least one officer tested positive for the coronavirus. The Southwest District building and all vehicles assigned to the district are being sanitized, the department said Saturday. Officers from other districts will backfill coverage in the district. “Out of an abundance of caution, the department is temporarily adjusting operations as a precautionary measure for the agency,” Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said in a statement. Officials said the department is expediting testing for all employees assigned to the Southwest District station. Harrison said in a statement that all of the officers that tested positive for COVID-19 "are all recovering and are in good spirits.” Harold Diggs, president of the Southwest Neighborhood Community Development Corp., said he’s anxious about having officers policing an area they’re unfamiliar with. “It’s very concerning,” Diggs said. “We have never had officers coming in the area that we would have to build a temporary relationship with." Diggs, who is from the Edgewood neighborhood, said he’s also worried less-experienced officers will be plugged in to fill gaps left by the other officers’ absence. Anita Cathcart, president of the Allendale Community Association, was one of a handful of community leaders on a 4 p.m. call Sunday with Harrison. She said the commissioner told the group that the department is in the process of cleaning the building so officers can return. He told them he’s waiting for the test results of other officers before coming up with a long-term plan. “They’re moving the chess pieces around and they’re seeing what fits and what doesn’t,” she said. Cathcart said that though there are concerns about whether the department will respond more slowly to lesser crimes, she had not seen any indication of that. She said officers responding to an alleged robbery at a nearby construction site after the station closed did so in a similar fashion and time as before the closure. “It was responded to immediately. There was no lagging in time,” Cathcart said. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said in a statement that the closure and self-quarantining will protect the health of officers, and that steps were immediately taken once the department was made aware of the potential exposure. “I am confident that Commissioner Harrison and his team are taking every precaution to avoid the possible spread of this virus,” Young said. “All of our residents need to remain vigilant, and continue to comply with the governor’s stay-at-home order to limit the risks of exposure to this dangerous and deadly disease." Democratic City Council President Brandon Scott called for Young’s administration to “institute a practice of pre-work-shift temperature testing for all our frontline employees in city government.” In recent weeks, the police and fire departments have been creating policies to enforce social distancing statewide mandates, as well as reduce officer exposure, including closing police buildings to the public. Other agencies across the country are also grappling with staffing shortages as officers become ill or are forced to self-quarantine to slow the disease’s spread. In New York City, which has been the hardest-hit region, media reports say about one out of every six officers is out sick or in quarantine.

Baltimore to turn downtown convention center, hotel into field hospital amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Baltimore Convention Center on West Pratt Street and the adjacent city-owned Hilton Hotel will be converted to a field hospital to accommodate a surge in patients amid the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday. A joint partnership between the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine will operate the hospital, which is being set up by the Maryland National Guard. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to provide at least 250 beds for the sites. “My administration is marshaling every tool in the arsenal of public health to combat and slow the spread of this pandemic,” Hogan said as he outlined a sweeping new set of measures Maryland will take to combat the spread of the virus. The Republican governor did not say when the facility was expected to open. Opening the field hospital is part of Hogan’s plan to add 6,000 hospital beds in the state to accommodate an anticipated surge in patients needing treatment due to the coronavirus. The first phase, he said, has yielded 900 more beds that are immediately available. Another 1,400 beds should be ready by early April. The plan for more beds includes re-opening the Laurel Regional Hospital, which will be able to accommodate 135 patients “in short order,” Hogan said. After it was acquired by the University of Maryland Medical System in 2017, Laurel Regional was converted to an outpatient medical center and its acute care functions were transferred to Capital Region Medical Center in Cheverly. But with the coronavirus outbreak, hospitals have been rushing to meet Hogan’s calls for more beds, canceling surgeries and moving patients and their procedures to outpatient facilities. The planned 250 beds to be added in downtown Baltimore barely scratches the capacity available between the hotel and convention center. The city-owned Hilton Baltimore offers 757 rooms, while the convention center spans 1.2 million square feet. Conventions and other scheduled events have been canceled or postponed, making the hotel’s rooms and center’s halls available for use. The governor also said health care providers are to cease elective procedures and prioritize coronavirus testing for patients who are hospitalized. Hogan also outlined plans for more drive-through testing sites. His administration has five converted vehicle emission inspection centers “ready to immediately open” as soon as the state can secure testing kits, protective equipment and lab capability. Also, he said, the Prince George’s County Health Department is working with the state to set up a drive-through screening station at FedEx Field in Landover. Hogan said he issued orders Monday to authorize a process to “fast track” more testing capability in Maryland without waiting for federal action or approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although the governor said “this will dramatically shorten” the timeline, he did not describe what the actions will involve. The governor acknowledged the personal sacrifices being made by those who work in health care. “I just want to take a moment to say thank you to the countless health care professionals, the doctors, and the nurses, the first responders, who are on the front lines every day, working around the clock to help keep us safe,” Hogan said.

Howard County students make, donate 1,200 face shields to Maryland hospitals amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
While schools across the state have been closed or practicing remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic, a group of Howard County students have joined together for a project that would likely impress many of their teachers. The Clarksville Youth Care Group — comprised of 40 Howard County students — has made and donated more than 1,200 face shields to 25 hospitals in Maryland. “We felt like we couldn’t just sit back and let doctors be in danger for us,” said Atholton High School freshman Arthur Wang. “We wanted to help the community. It feels great that our project was needed and it’s actually playing a big role in hospitals near here.” The project, like others that have cropped up in the past two months since the coronavirus pandemic altered everyday life in the United States, started with a small goal. The first phase, funded by the students’ parents, ended with nine hospitals receiving a total of 200 face shields created with everyday items like foam, plastic sheets and elastic bands and based on directions from Johns Hopkins. The second phase, which ended a few weeks ago, augmented the scope of the project with 1,000 donated face shields. “We’re Chinese, and we have some relatives in China. My uncle is a doctor in China, so basically he opened our eyes to the circumstances we’re in right now,” Arthur said. “Even when China was dealing with it, they were short on protective equipment. We saw the shortage in protective equipment and decided that we needed to help them.” The Clarksville Youth Care Group was founded by Arthur and his younger sister, Amanda, a seventh grader at Clarksville Middle School. The group now has more than 40 members from 13 different Howard County schools. “It really just started off with me and Arthur and a couple of friends we reached out to,” Amanda said. “From there, we made a volunteer form and started spreading the word.” “I know Arthur and Amanda, and my mother brought the project up to me,” said David Wen, a sixth grader at Clarksville Middle. “I wanted to help the community, so I decided to try to give back and help with the project.” Following the first phase, the group grew in numbers and needed donations to increase the amount of face shields it could make and donate. Along with funding from parents, the group received donations from real estate agent Shun Lu, Ivy Mortgage Inc. and the We Care nonprofit. The majority of the hospitals receiving the face shields are local, including Howard County General Hospital, Johns Hopkins Hospital, University of Maryland Medical Center, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, St. Agnes Hospital and Anne Arundel Medical Center. The group has also donated about 200 face shields to two hospitals in New York: St. Francis Hospital and Strong Memorial Hospital. Johns Hopkins Bayview, St. Agnes and several others have sent letters of appreciation to the Clarksville Youth Care Group for the face shields. “Many thanks for your generous donation of the face shields for our doctors and nurses. Your very thoughtful donation will be put to great use in caring for our St. Agnes Hospital patients during this health care crisis,” wrote Richard Pomerantz, St. Agnes Hospital Department of Medicine chairman. “The great community support from organizations like yours is of tremendous comfort to us in our daily roles caring for our patients who have contracted this disease. We are most grateful for your efforts and support. It is great to know we can count on our community when we need them most.” “It felt pretty good that our product that we made was useful in helping people stay safe in hospitals,” Amanda said. The group is now in its third phase, with a goal of donating 1,200 additional face shields. Doctors can request face shields at bit.ly/2SEdB2l, while those looking to help the Clarksville Youth Care Group can donate to its GoFundMe page at gofundme.com/f/face-shield-donations-for-doctors. “It’s been an amazing experience,” David said. “In school, I’m learning about heroes and what people do to help others. So I think it’s cool to take action and help others, too.”

Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation launches Strike Out Hunger campaign with $100,000 donation during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Orioles legend and Baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. joined Twitter on Tuesday to announce that the charity he runs with his family in honor of his late father, the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation, was diverting some of its resources away from its typical mission to fight the hunger crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In coordination with Cal and Bill Ripken, the foundation announced a $100,000 donation to Feeding America to launch its Strike Out Hunger campaign, with Ollie’s Bargain Outlet and the Kevin Harvick Foundation contributing an additional $150,000 to start the program. “For nearly two decades, our foundation has helped kids across the country through after-school programs and the building of fields to provide safe places to play and learn," Cal Ripken Jr. said in a statement. "However, we have decided to temporarily shift our focus due to the current crisis to address a more urgent need. We are proud to partner with Feeding America and food banks here in Maryland and across the country to make a difference to the underserved kids and families we impact and we are hoping that others will join us.” The announcement comes on the day ESPN is planning to re-air Ripken’s defining professional moment, from Sept. 6, 1995, when the Orioles played the California Angels and Ripken set the all-time record for consecutive games played with 2,131. Scheduled to air at 7 p.m., the game is part of a weekly series of Tuesday broadcasts on ESPN of defining games in baseball history.

Olszewski pares back Baltimore County budget plans anticipating coronavirus economic impact
.W
Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. has proposed a $3.9 billion operating budget for fiscal year 2021 that includes over $2 billion for education, funding for his public safety plan and two previously negotiated pay raises for all county employees. Olszewski estimates county revenues for the fiscal year beginning July 1 will be $40 million less than previously estimated because of an expected “steep economic decline” from the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, Olszewski said, the proposed budget only prioritizes the immediate needs required for the county “to weather this storm.” “This is not the budget I hoped to present to you this year, but it is the budget that meets the moment. Today, we are focused on responding to an immediate and evolving crisis," Olszewski said. The Democratic county executive’s latest budget proposal doesn’t include any tax increases, unlike the historic tax increase proposed — and passed — during fiscal 2020. Education and public safety Olszewski said the record $2 billion funding for education includes a proposed Baltimore County Public Schools budget that’s nearly $36 million above fiscal 2020′s funding levels and $20 million more than the required maintenance of effort. Specifically, Olszewski’s proposal provides a 1% cost-of-living increase for all Baltimore County Public Schools employees, effective July 1. It also provides more than $1 million to hire additional school counselors and support staff to help address the mental health, social and emotional needs of students. Additionally, the proposed budget allows the Community College of Baltimore County to freeze in-county tuition for the second year in a row, and it provides funding for a continuation of the College Promise scholarship program. The proposal is less than the $114 million increase the school system requested, and Olszewski said he would have liked to provide county schools with more of the requested resources. To avoid class size growth this year, he said he has advised the school system to place the 169 staff development teachers directly into classrooms to grow the ranks of the county’s "front-line teachers.” Olszewski said the budget will protect Baltimore County’s portion of capital funding for all remaining Schools for our Future construction projects, which cannot move forward until the state provides its share of funding from the Built to Learn Act. Olszewski said he also is asking County Council to approve a measure to place cameras on school buses to record drivers who pass stopped school buses illegally. The money collected from school bus camera violations will pay for public safety programs, he said. Olszewski said the 49 county homicides last year — the most in a year since 1985, according to FBI data — is “unacceptable.” Olszewski’s budget would use existing and new funding to hire two new police squads to focus full-time on “targeted law enforcement” priorities. The budget also includes a “real time crime center” that will combine data, human intelligence and technology to deploy resources more effectively, and money to build two Police Athletic League Centers through the Department of Recreation and Parks. Additionally, the proposed budget would give $1 million to support volunteer fire companies. The budget also would support the first phase of funding to purchase a second set of turnout gear for firefighters, he said. Workforce, community support Olszewski said the proposed budget would fully fund a deferred 2% cost-of-living adjustment for the county government’s workforce, effective June 30. The county’s budget would provide an additional 2% cost-of-living adjustment for county employees on January 1 — agreements made with labor unions before the coronavirus outbreak, Olszewski said. Olszewski’s budget also provides funding to fully implement the county’s new 311 program. He also wants to expand the county’s new Office of Ethics and Accountability. His proposal would create an “audit compliance unit” to ensure audit findings are effectively deployed to improve county operations and to help track tens of millions of dollars in COVID-related expenditures. The budget proposal also provides funds for planning and implementation of the Towson Circulator pilot program, building on a $1.6 million federal grant. Olszewski also wants to resume glass recycling after the prior administration suspended it. Olszewski stressed the “new reality” of the pandemic doesn’t leave "much room for extras,” however, he stressed the proposal still provides new funding for park acquisition and a “more equitable” distribution of park and recreational infrastructure. COVID-19′s impact Maryland’s confirmed number of coronavirus cases exceeds 9,400, and the state’s cumulative death toll from the pandemic is over 300. The virus has forced many companies to furlough or layoff workers, and Olszewski expects the county will continue to feel the impact of the pandemic after it ends. Citing dire economic projections from the International Monetary Fund, Olszewski said the county Office of Budget and Finance updated their projection at the beginning of April, resulting in a budget that spends about $46 million less than the county had planned as recently as a month ago. Olszewski said the budget he’s submitting is more than $8 million below the guidelines set forth by the Spending Affordability Committee and reserves nearly $6 million to top up the county’s rainy day fund — “a fund that we may need to help our recovery should some of the worst-case scenarios materialize,” he said. “Given both the rapidly changing nature and severity of the economic decline ahead, it is reasonable to expect another revenue write-down before the County Council completes its work on this budget. It is also reasonable to expect that mid-year adjustments to the Fiscal Year 2021 budget will be necessary as we better understand the depth of the crisis,” Olszewski said. The county implemented a hiring freeze last week to avoid furloughs and layoffs. Olszewski acknowledged the proposed budget means the county will not be able to hire additional people, such as teachers. It also means programs and initiatives will need to be deferred or reconsidered. The county will have to do without funding for more turf fields, updates to county senior centers, street paving and major flood mitigation projects, “just to name a few," he said. The County Council is scheduled to vote on the budget on May 21. Details for the full budget are available on the county government’s website.

After coronavirus case confirmed in Harford, government and health officials say there’s no danger to community
.W
A Harford County woman who has been hospitalized with coronavirus didn’t show symptoms until six days after she returned from an overseas trip, health officials said Monday. Harford County Health Officer Russell W. Moy said the 86-year-old did not leave her house after she returned home from the trip until she started feeling ill, when she went straight to the hospital. Gov. Larry Hogan specified that the woman contracted the virus while traveling to Turkey, at a Monday news conference in Annapolis. “This appears to be the first case of COVID-19 anywhere in the world to be associated with travel to Turkey," Hogan said. At an earlier press conference with other county officials Monday in Bel Air, Moy declined to identify the person and where she was traveling from — leaving it that there is no danger to the community. "We are hopeful that based on the current information we have there will be no community mitigation recommendations made by the Maryland Department of Health,” Moy said. Two other family members who drove the woman to the hospital are also in quarantine, Moy said. They are not showing symptoms. Harford County government and health officials said the county will continue to operate as it usually does against the backdrop of its first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus. Harford County confirmed its first case of coronavirus Sunday after Gov. Larry Hogan announced the respiratory virus had sickened two additional Marylanders, bringing the state’s total to five. The woman tested positive for the illness after traveling overseas. Asked if any of the other people on the plane with the woman were at risk, Moy said the disease is new and its contagiousness is still unknown. But because she did not show symptoms on the plane, she would not have met the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for an investigation. The woman was not symptomatic on the plane, Moy said, and her first symptoms started six days after she landed. During that time, Moy said, she did not leave her house except to seek medical treatment. Moy declined to say where the woman was being treated. University of Maryland Medical System, which operates both Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air and Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace, along with others throughout the region, confirmed Sunday that a COVID-19 patient was being treated at one of its hospitals. The Harford County case is not connected to any of the other four confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state, all in Montgomery County. Harford County Executive Barry Glassman said the county is working closely with the Maryland Department of Health — which is leading the state’s investigation into coronavirus cases — and does not plan on curtailing or limiting any of its services, though it does have a plan should that become necessary. Superintendent of Harford County Public Schools Sean Bulson has been in contact with local principals to reemphasize the need for sick students to stay home. He said schools are also considering making allowance to perfect attendance records in view of the coronavirus scare. “We do not have plans to close schools or cancel activities at this time,” Bulson said, though he has asked schools to not add additional activities to their calendars. Glassman will also meet with Gov. Larry Hogan to receive updates and coordinate response efforts. “We will be operating how we normally do in Harford County,” he said at the Monday press conference. The virus, originating in Wuhan, China, has sickened over 200,000 people and killed thousands, primarily in China, according to the Wold Health Organization. Moy said people over 60 with chronic underlying conditions, people with compromised immune systems and those who have recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan are at the most risk. “This is a new and unpredictable public health topic,” Moy said, "but if it is addressed like other public health emergencies in the past, we will be OK.” The virus in Maryland has been mostly confined to Montgomery County. Hogan announced last week that three people had tested positive for the virus after going on a cruise of the Nile River. Officials announced that another Montgomery County man tested positive and was briefly hospitalized alongside news of the Harford County resident testing positive for the virus. State health officials said there were “no major concerns over exposure risk to the community,” from the two newest cases. Still, concerns over the virus’ spread have rippled through Harford County. The John Carroll School, which planned to host a Holocaust remembrance day on this coming Wednesday, had to modify their programming. Holocaust survivors were scheduled to speak, but fears of the virus coupled with the vulnerability of senior citizens made them reconsider. With some speakers pulling out of the event, the school will show a selection of movies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends avoiding contact with sick people, covering mouths when sneezing and washing hands to prevent the virus’ spread. The officials also warned against misinformation on social media and encouraged citizens to get updates from credible resources like the CDC and the Maryland Department of Health.

Sixth Mount Airy nursing home resident dies of coronavirus as more staffers test positive, Carroll County officials say
.W
Carroll County officials on Friday acknowledged a sixth resident from Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy had died, and said six additional staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total to 24. The sixth resident to die was a man in his 80s with underlying conditions, county officials said. A total of 77 residents have been confirmed to have the virus. The county also announced Friday that Carroll Lutheran Village, a retirement community in Westminster, now has a total of seven residents and two staff members who have tested positive for the coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 disease it causes. The resident is a woman in her 80s, and the staff member is a woman in her 60s. “The Health Department and the Maryland Department of Health continue to work closely with Carroll Lutheran Village to discuss infection control, conservation of personal protective equipment, disinfection and cleaning, patient care and isolation, and communications,” county officials said in a news release. “Carroll Lutheran Village continues to monitor all residents and team members and require anyone exhibiting symptoms to self-isolate and seek medical care if needed.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and other state officials on Friday said they have identified coronavirus cases or clusters of cases in 60 different nursing home facilities and multiple correctional facilities across the state. Although older populations can be particularly vulnerable to the virus, state officials warned again Friday that it does not only affect the old or vulnerable, and has been found in people of all ages and backgrounds as it continues to sweep across Maryland, the nation and the world. As of Friday, there were 416 coronavirus patients hospitalized in the state, with 43% — nearly 180 people — in intensive care, Hogan said. “We now have widespread, community transmission," he said. “This virus is everywhere and it is a threat to nearly everyone.” To control the spread and protect residents in the hobbled economy, Hogan also expanded housing protections to homeowners and commercial and industrial renters, issuing an executive order that bars banks and other lenders from initiating foreclosure proceedings against mortgage holders, and preventing landlords from evicting commercial and industrial renters. Hogan had previously halted evictions of residential renters. The Republican governor also put a halt during the current state of emergency on the repossession of cars and motor homes. And he said 70 banks, mortgage lenders and other financial lenders in the state have agreed to provide additional flexibility to those in debt. As of Friday evening, Carroll County officials have confirmed a total of 136 people have tested positive. Six have died — all of them Pleasant View residents. County officials also announced four community members have tested positive: a man in his 20s, a woman in her 40s, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 50s. The governor made his comments in Annapolis on Friday afternoon, after officials reported an 18% jump in the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state from the day prior, to 2,758. There have been 42 deaths in Maryland. “I wish that I could tell you when we’re going to turn the corner," Hogan said. "We simply don’t know just how bad things are going to get, or exactly how long this is going to last.” Frances Phillips, the state’s deputy secretary for public health services, said nursing homes have been hit hard. “We have outbreaks across the state now,” she said. She noted the cluster of more than 90 cases among residents and staff at the Pleasant View Nursing Home, but said multiple other homes have clusters of seven to 10 cases. Phillips said there is “clear evidence” now that asymptomatic staff are helping the spread. She said the state is now ordering “universal masking” among staff, meaning all workers within nursing homes must wear masks. The acute respiratory disease caused by the virus has now affected more than a million people globally. The pandemic has forced strict control measures, including a stay-at-home order that Hogan instituted in Maryland. Hogan has said the spread of the virus, which is overwhelming health care facilities, including in the New York area, is only going to get worse in Maryland before it gets better. Phillips said state officials have looked at models for the trajectory of the virus in the state, and that the governor is leaning on experts to interpret those models. She said each model is only as good as the “assumptions that are built into them." ”Clearly what the governor has said is that we are on the beginning of a curve," she said. Phillips repeatedly called the coronavirus a “sneaky virus,” about which new information is constantly emerging. She said healthcare workers must wear high-quality masks. Information about whether members of the general public should wear “cloth masks” is evolving, she said, but such masks would be beneficial if worn by people with symptoms, to not spread the virus to others around them. Everyone should be careful, because the virus is affecting both young and old residents, she said. “It’s important that we smother these nursing homes with infection control,” she said, “but do not think that virus is only in nursing homes." ”This virus is here and it’s in our communities." Phillips said the most important thing state officials are doing right now is procuring ventilators — looking everywhere they can to increase capacity at state hospitals, including on the open market and in medical schools and other facilities across Maryland. “Believe we are scouring this state for all of the available ventilators that we can put into use,” she said. Anyone who thinks they or a family member might be showing coronavirus symptoms can call the Carroll County Health Department’s COVID-19 hotline, which is available 8 a.m. through 5 p.m. seven days a week at 410-876-4848, or contact their doctor. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. People with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Hogan, other Maryland officials are ‘suspending the normal social order’ to halt coronavirus. Is that legal?
.W
Closing schools. Shuttering bars. Barring evictions. Banning large gatherings. Delaying an election. In the last week, under threat of the deadly new coronavirus overwhelming the medical system, Gov. Larry Hogan and other Maryland officials have issued a slate of sweeping orders that would have been unthinkable only a short time ago. “We’re suspending the normal social order,” acknowledged Attorney General Brian Frosh, the state’s top lawyer, whose office has been advising Hogan. The measures have been called draconian by some, overdue by others. People, including many health experts, have praised Hogan for taking actions that will save lives, while others have challenged him for undercutting the incomes of landlords and bartenders, card dealers and other wage earners. The orders straddle the line between the public and private good, pitting the financial health of some against the physical health of all. And because of their sweeping, intrusive impacts, they raise a simple question: Are they legal? The answer, according to legal experts, is yes — largely because of the state of emergency declared by Hogan March 5. “Once the governor declares an emergency, he has extraordinary powers to do what is needed to meet the emergency,” said Michael Greenberger, director of the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland School of Law. President Donald Trump and other federal officials are making similar moves under a national emergency declaration. Greenberger and his 25-person staff are among the nation’s foremost experts on executive powers in emergency settings, and have particularly in-depth knowledge of laws in Maryland. They are currently advising a whole host of other jurisdictions and agencies across the country, having been inundated by questions not only about "what the law is, but what the best practices are.” Asked about the orders by Hogan and other state executives — like Maryland State School Superintendent Karen Salmon, who ordered schools closed — Greenberger said there is no question they have flexed their executive powers in accordance with the law. “Those powers cannot be used in an arbitrary and capricious manner, so that there are both express and implied abilities of citizens in Maryland to challenge what the governor has done,” Greenberger said. “But the governor, in a case of declared emergency, has extraordinary powers.” Making the case that Hogan has been “capricious” would be tough, he said. Hogan has tried to show a steady hand in introducing additional measures, day by day, as the crisis has built. He has acknowledged some represent burdens, but asked for cooperation. “I know that right now there is a lot of anxiety and stress out there — folks are worried about what lies ahead and how we will get through this,” he said this week. “But I want Marylanders to know that if we continue to lead and work together — if we rely on and help each other — we will get through this.” Frosh, a Democrat who has clashed with the Republican governor over various matters in the past, said Hogan has been going “methodically down the right path” in considering the options before him. And Frosh supports the decisions he has made thus far. “There is going to be a lot of financial suffering, but it beats death," Frosh said. Historically, some of the earliest examples of governments being granted sweeping emergency powers over their citizens came amid epidemics and pandemics, when special ad hoc committees were empowered to take over sanitation and disposal efforts, said Wendy Parmet, director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University School of Law. Later, around the second half of the 20th Century, communities and states began to legislate such emergency powers into law, so that the authority didn’t have to be reestablished each time an emergency arose. “What’s interesting about public health law is that ... it’s a history of emergency law, of empowering extraordinary things to be done" during sudden health crises, Parmet said. “There has always been extraordinary legal responses to those emergencies.” While the United States hasn’t seen such drastic health measures in 100 years, “in some sense we are just back to the future, living in a nightmare that so many of the generations before would have been more familiar with," Parmet said. “Horrible pandemics and epidemics that could almost destroy a city — that’s part of the human fate. That’s part of our history as a species.” Long before the current pandemic began, the Maryland legislature had vested great powers in the governor whenever an emergency has been declared. This week, it gave him even more powers, including the right to halt price gouging on certain items in high demand. Throughout the past few weeks, as Hogan’s staff has worked to devise executive orders to help the state halt the spread of the deadly new respiratory disease, they have bounced ideas and questions off assistant attorneys general who work out of all the various state agencies being affected, from health and education to elections, insurance and transportation, Frosh said. “His lawyers will talk to our lawyers, some of his agency people will talk to our lawyers,” Frosh said. “We don’t make the decision about what to do, but we do tell them what we think they can do, and the best way of accomplishing their goals." Hogan’s chief legal counsel, Michael Pedone, who was previously responsible for legal and risk management affairs as general counsel for Tradepoint Atlantic, could not be reached for comment, but Frosh and others say he has been a central figure in the administration’s actions. A Hogan aide called Pedone “a machine.” Frosh said as a general rule, the governor is empowered to prioritize the good of the whole. As an example, he pointed to Hogan’s recent order barring evictions of renters who can show they have suffered substantial financial loss due to the outbreak. “The eviction piece is an interesting one to think about, because it really does intrude upon people’s private property rights,” Frosh said. “But as a society, the last thing in the world we need right now is more homeless people, people who are out on the street without a stable place to live, coming into contact with all types of other people and locations.” Landlords may have the right to try to challenge the order in court, Greenberger said, but when governors “act on behalf of the health and welfare of the entire population, they have a lot of legal leverage in terms of impacting individuals.” Frosh said that “owning an apartment or a home or a business is really irrelevant if you don’t survive to take advantage of it.” He also said that, once the state of emergency is lifted, he expects “a series of rolling crises that stem from this,” including some linked to landlords and tenants clashing over back rent and other issues. “It’s not possible to predict them all, but there are going to be a series of economic consequences that are going to be extremely serious." There may also be more orders to come, shaking up our understanding of the future even more. Greenberger said that Hogan has explicit powers “that would go far beyond” those he has already taken, including the power to order geographic quarantines and issue directives to medical personnel licensed in the state. “There are many levers left to pull," Greenberger said. Parmet said it will be interesting to see how far Maryland and other states go during this pandemic, in part because the “outer limits” of their powers have never been fully tested in the past, and “are not completely known.”

McCormick says it can’t yet tell impact of coronavirus on China business
.W
The impact of the new coronavirus on McCormick & Co.'s China operations remains unknown and executives are closely watching efforts to contain the outbreak. China is the Hunt Valley-based spice maker’s second-largest market in terms of sales and it has three plants there, including a manufacturing facility in Wuhan, where the virus began and remains centered. “Our concern, first and foremost, is for the health and safety of our employees and around product safety,” McCormick President and CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said Tuesday as the company announced financial results for the end of last year. “A lot of our efforts and responses are directed to that. “It’s too early to really know what the impact is going to be.” Chinese officials have reported more than 4,500 cases and 106 deaths. The illness has spread to other countries, including the United States, where five cases, all among travelers, have been confirmed in California, Washington, Illinois and Arizona. Maryland health officials are testing a patient suspected of being infected. The CDC has said Americans remain at low risk for infection from the virus. All of the confirmed cases are in people who recently traveled from China. McCormick does not break out and disclose its sales in China because that business makes up less than 10 percent of revenue. But it is a profitable and growing segment and an important part of McCormick’s focus on emerging markets. All McCormick’s Chinese plants, located as well in Shanghai and Guangzhou, are closed for the Chinese New Year holiday. But the Chinese government is expected to allow the plants to reopen on their regular schedule, Kurzius said. That could mean Monday, or in Shanghai, where officials imposed special restrictions, by Feb. 10, he said. The plants get raw materials and distribute products only within the Chinese market, he said. “So far it’s not a business interruption, and it really remains to be seen how far this goes,” Kurzius said. Fewer people traveling, going out to eat or going shopping at grocery stores “is not a positive for business,” he said. “We can’t really quantify it right now. We think more facts will come out in coming days.” The uncertainty spooked the market and McCormick shares tumbled nearly 4% to $166.06 each. But even with that question about China, McCormick said it expects sales this year to grow from 2% to 4% compared with 2019, driven by new products, brand marketing and expanded distribution. The spice maker ended its fiscal year with sales up 1% to $5.3 billion compared with the year before. For the three months that ended Nov. 30, the company reported that sales grew 1% to $1.48 billion, while its profit dipped slightly. McCormick said it earned $213.4 million, or $1.59 a share, in the three months that ended Nov. 30, compared with $214 million, or $1.60 a share, a year earlier.

Dr. Leana Wen, frequent national commentator during coronavirus pandemic, has her baby
.W
It’s a girl! Former Baltimore city health commissioner Dr. Leana Wen gave birth to a baby girl, Isabelle Wen Walker, on Friday, according to the physician’s Twitter account. It’s the second child for Wen and her husband, Sebastian Walker. Wen left the city in 2018 to head Planned Parenthood, but was ousted after a contentious eight-month tenure. She is a visiting professor at George Washington University in Washington. In recent weeks, Wen has lent her public health expertise to numerous TV programs regarding the outbreak of COVID-19 in the U.S., including appearances on CNN and BBC News. Late last month, she penned a column for The Washington Post about being pregnant during the pandemic, and the precautions expectant mothers should take. “Even in the best of times, childbirth is a time of uncertainty and major life changes," she wrote. "Add to that a world thrown dangerously off-kilter by a public health crisis, and the rising stack of unknowns can feel close to toppling.” Wen wrote that her worst fear was having to be separated from her newborn immediately following delivery, as is necessary should a mother test positive for the novel coronavirus. But in a photo posted to Twitter, she’s snuggling the sleeping baby against her chest.

Instagram account announcing 2-week coronavirus shutdown for Carroll County schools fake, all facilities open

A post on an Instagram account featuring a Carroll County Public Schools logo said the school system would be shutting for two weeks to prevent spread of coronavirus. The post is false and the account is fake, school officials said Monday. Carroll County Public Schools does not have an Instagram account, spokeswoman Carey Gaddis said. CCPS does share social media posts through Facebook and Twitter. The school system wrote in an email to families, regarding a decision to close a school or group of schools for a period of time, “Please know that the decision will be made only after soliciting recommendations and input from our local and state health departments. The safety and well-being of our students and staff will continues to be the basis for any decision.” A page on the CCPS website, carrollk12.org, located in the lefthand menu, provides updates and information on preventative measures for the virus as well as other illness like cold and flu. Official channels for notifying the public of news such as school closings include phone call, email, and text message through the SchoolMessenger system. Information would also be posted on www.carrollk12.org, the legitimate CCPS Facebook and Twitter accounts and CETV – Channel 21. No cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Carroll County, though a handful had been confirmed in Maryland as of 5 p.m. Monday in those who had traveled internationally

Maryland said it has released 2,000 inmates from prisons and jails to slow spread of the coronavirus
.W
The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services announced Monday that it has released 2,000 inmates from its jails, prisons and other detention facilities over the past five weeks in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus behind bars. The announcement comes one day after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order designed to speed up the release of at least 700 men and women from correctional facilities across the state. The order speeds up processing of inmates already eligible to be released within the next four months and accelerates the processing of inmates eligible for home detention. The corrections department offered no details about when the releases began, how many had been freed in the past week or why the department remained quiet amid an aggressive push from local leaders in Baltimore, public health officials and prisoner advocates calling on Hogan to reduce crowding in the state’s prisons. Department spokesperson Mark Vernarelli said in a statement that the releases were made possible by “leveraging the acceleration and placements" into pretrial supervision and releasing others during the booking process. The department also accelerated processing releases through the Parole Commission and Home Detention Placement program. As of Friday — the last day a figure was reported — Maryland said it had 136 cases of COVID-19 in the correctional system, with the Jessup Correctional Institution having 40, the highest number in the system. The figure includes inmates, correctional officers and contractual employees. One inmate in his 60s has died, according to the department. Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera last week encouraged the release of inmates who were most susceptible to the virus and who pose no threat to public safety. Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby had been leading the charge for early release of large numbers of prisoners. In March, in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak in Maryland, Mosby issued sweeping changes to arrest policies, saying she would not jail people arrested on charges including attempted drug distribution, some thefts and prostitution. Nearly 200 doctors, professors and staff at Johns Hopkins University sent a similar request to Hogan on March 23, saying the governor’s “inaction on this issue is putting the lives of Marylanders at risk." Some inmates in Baltimore’s prisons have offered an inside look into the daily living conditions in unclean facilities and with a lack of adequate equipment. Hogan’s office has not yet said whether it will send more personal protective equipment to the prisons, including N95 masks, which AFSCME leader Patrick Moran said is essential for prison staffers and inmates. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees represents many correctional department employees.

Hoods Mill Landfill to close, payment options limited at Northern Landfill to help reduce spread of coronavirus
.W
Out of an interest in preventing spread of the coronavirus, Carroll County’s commissioners voted Tuesday to close Hoods Mill Landfill in Woodbine, starting April 4, until further notice. The Board of County Commissioners also voted in a session held remotely via live stream — both votes were unanimous — to limit payment options at Northern Landfill in Westminster to credit cards and checks only, effective immediately. A county news release states: “Minimizing public contact helps limit the spread of COVID-19 and protects everyone’s health. To help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our community, residents and businesses of Carroll County are asked to avoid all non-essential outings and close contact.” The disposal of waste is considered an essential service, according to the governor’s orders relating to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. County officials previously expressed concern about increased risk of exposure after the two landfills experienced an influx of visitors. Dwight Amoss, county landfill manager, last week said that 631 paying customers drove across the scales at the Northern Landfill to drop off trash March 21, and 278 did the same at Hoods Mill. That does not count those who came to dispose of recycling, metal or yard waste, he said. On March 27, the county issued a news release recommending customers pay by credit card only at the Northern Landfill and discouraging trips that are not immediately necessary. County officials suggest waiting until the state of emergency is lifted or contracting with a local hauler to dispose of waste and recycling. A list of licensed haulers can be found on the county’s website at County Residential Curb-side Haulers or through your local phone directory.

Gov. Hogan mandates masks in stores, on transit; warns against quick end to measures to contain the coronavirus
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan is requiring masks or face coverings to be worn in stores and on public transit beginning Saturday, as Maryland continues to face the coronavirus pandemic. The order, which Hogan announced Wednesday, comes on the heels of several local governments enacting mask requirements or guidelines, including Baltimore. Cloth masks, homemade masks and bandannas meet the requirements. The order also requires stores and carryout restaurants that remain open to mark 6-foot distances for people to stand in line, sanitize the handles of shopping carts and baskets, and allow workers to wash their hands every 30 minutes. “While this order is an important step in our immediate efforts to protect public health and safety, the wearing of masks is also something that we may all have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state," Hogan said during a news conference at the State House in Annapolis. Hogan and his staff members continued their practice of wearing masks at the event, removing them only to speak at the podium. Hogan said Maryland is beginning to see initial signs that social distancing is working. Hospitalization rates are starting to show possible signs of stabilizing. FutureCare Lochearn, a nursing home in Northwest Baltimore, reported 129 cases among its residents and 41 cases among its staff, making it one of the largest outbreaks in the country. The statewide death toll shot up Wednesday to 413, including 47 deaths of people who were confirmed to have the virus and another 64 deaths that were likely due to the virus, state officials said. Still, Hogan sees hope that the state’s measures are working. “Because of early and aggressive actions, and because of the extraordinary sacrifice of Marylanders, we’re now in a position to move from containment and mitigation to plan the gradual rollout of our recovery phase,” the Republican governor said. Hogan said such plans would be laid out in greater detail next week, though he touched on four necessary steps: greatly expanding the state’s capacity to test people for the disease, with a goal of 10,000 tests a day; increasing hospitals’ capacity to treat COVID-19 patients; boosting the state’s supply of personal protective equipment; and building a 1,000-person operation to trace the contacts of sick people. “There are some very real reasons for hope and optimism right now, and there is clearly a light at the end of this tunnel, but exactly how and when we will get to that light is going to be up to each and every one of us,” Hogan said. Hogan said his team has discussed for weeks how to reopen businesses and institutions because he expects it to be a difficult process. Asked when the restrictions might be lifted, Hogan said, “I think everybody would like to know when we’re going to get back to a normal life. “The worst possible thing we could do is to take actions too quickly and then have that spike so we look like New York. ... We are starting to slow that growth slightly. We have not yet reached the peak. Now would be the worst time to take our foot off the accelerator.” Pressure to start lifting restrictions has been beginning to grow among residents suffering economically due to lost jobs and frustrated to be stuck at home. Two groups of governors — one in the Northeast, the other on the West Coast — forged pacts earlier this week to work together on easing restrictions and reopening their economies. Maryland is not part of such a pact, but Hogan is in regular contact with Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser. Bowser has extended the District’s stay-at-home orders and school closures through May 15. Hogan said he would meet Friday with Northam and Bowser. And earlier Wednesday, a handful of state lawmakers said during a meeting of a coronavirus work group that they hoped Maryland soon would turn to planning a way forward. “This is just as much a plague on our economy as it is a health pandemic,” said Sen. Stephen Hershey of the Eastern Shore, the second-ranking Republican in Senate. “It’s time we start looking forward.” One of the governor’s precursors to easing restrictions is to increase contact tracing. Currently, 250 people are doing such work. The state wants to have at least 1,000 workers dedicated to that effort. Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for public health, said 100% of the state’s health investigators are now engaged in tracing COVID-19 cases. She said the circle of contacts for coronavirus patients has become smaller because Marylanders are cooperating with social distancing and stay-at-home orders. Phillips said more than 800 Marylanders have voluntarily registered as having recovered from coronavirus, more than the state’s confirmed number of people who have recovered. The state also needs to significantly increase the number of tests it conducts. ″We believe we’re on track to try to get there," Hogan said of the goal of 10,000 daily tests. Asked about President Donald Trump’s comments about outranking governors regarding when to reopen the economy, Hogan said an “interesting dynamic” played out over the past 24 hours. He believes Trump, a Republican, reversed himself by the end of the day Tuesday. There are certain federal guidelines states are bound by, Hogan said, but “I think the governors are going to make their own decisions within the guidelines." Hogan said he has asked the Trump administration to support the governors and states, and asked for help in breaking a “logjam” in the U.S. Senate for aid to the states. Hogan has asked the federal government to send $500 billion to state governments to help fill gaping holes in budgets caused by extra expenses to fight the pandemic and sharp drops in tax collection. One worst-case scenario shows Maryland alone could lose $2.8 billion by the end of June due to diminished collection of sales and income taxes. “Without sufficient federal investment, we will be unable to do all the things we’re being asked to do and states could be forced to confront the prospect of devastating budget reductions to essential services,” Hogan said.

Ravens wide receiver Willie Snead IV is donating $15,000 to help coronavirus relief efforts in Baltimore, he announced Wednesday. The donation to UnitedHealthCare, which the health care company matched, will help the Y in Central Maryland provide 40-pound boxes of nonperishable foods to 750 families in the city. “I just want to encourage everybody to stay positive, stay faithful, stay hopeful during these times because even though it doesn’t look good, in prayer, in faith, and together, if we believe this, this storm will pass,” Snead said on social media. Snead isn’t the only Ravens wide receiver helping out. On Thursday night, Miles Boykin is hosting a virtual meet-and-greet on Chatalyze, with all proceeds benefiting the United Way’s COVID-19 relief fund. “When you’re a kid, this is like what you dream about, and it’s crazy I can truly say I’m truly living my dream," he told Indiana’s ABC57. "That’s why I do things like this, to be able to give back, because I’m so blessed and I just want to pass it on.”

Golf courses, parks and marinas packed in Harford after Gov. Larry Hogan lightens coronavirus restrictions
.W
Thursday was like Christmas came early for those anxious to get back on the golf course and on the water, as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan peeled back restrictions on certain outdoor recreational activities. “It was a little chaotic as we had no prior warning and of course, everybody had a bit of a plan in the hopes that this would happen, but as soon as [the governor] said the words, as much as we started to celebrate the phones actually started to ring,” said Carol McCarthy, General Manager of Mountain Branch Golf Course in Joppa. “It was a wonderful thing, but it was absolute chaos.” Golf courses were one of a number of outdoor recreational places allowed to reopen. State parks, beaches and playgrounds were also re-opened and boating, fishing, camping and hunting were among outdoor activities that were allowed to resume at 7 a.m. Thursday with certain protocols in place. “I am delirious, I can’t tell you,” golfer Barbara Wolfe said from Mountain Branch. “I felt like I just had this hood over my head. As fortunate as I feel, compared to people in the city in the apartment, there was just that thing that was keeping me from feeling good. It’s spring, you know, the warm weather,” Wolfe added. McCarthy said golf courses are following all protocols laid out in the governor’s Best Practices for Businesses to Reopen in Maryland’s Roadmap To Recovery. Mike Corriggio, the pro shop manager at Bulle Rock Golf Course in Havre de Grace, said “everybody gets their own individual cart, obviously we are sanitizing the carts. No rakes out there, no divot repair/sand bottles, the cups or pin placements will have pool noodles on them.” Bulle Rock is allowing just 10 people in the pro shop at one time, no pull carts at any time and after 5 p.m. play is walkers only. “We are following the rules and doing everything we can until we hear otherwise,” Corriggio said. Thursday was a busy day at the Geneva Farm Golf Course in Street. “We are open for business, the range is open and we’ve set it up for social distancing,” said Bill Buzzell, operations manager at the course. “We’re set up on the protocols, nobody can touch a flag, have to wear a mask in the pro shop.” Hogan’s 3 p.m. Wednesday announcement, though welcomed, left course managers little time to get ready. “They were out here late in the evening last night cutting new holes in the greens and taking rakes off and getting everything prepared,” Buzzell said. “And then our tee sheet today is well over 130 or 140 golfers. It was funny, nobody was here this morning, everybody booked tee times starting at 9 o’clock and from 9 o’clock on, we’ve been pretty steady.” Beth Boyson, manager at Wetlands Golf Course in Aberdeen, said management and staff were glad to be open, regardless of the short notice. "All the guys are out here and all are happy to be outside doing their thing with their friends,” Boyson said. “They’re all social distancing and wearing their masks when they come inside. I wish it had been sooner, but we’re happy and we’re not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.” The water was also a very popular spot on Thursday. Allan Stifler brought family members living at his house in Aberdeen to Mariner Point Park in Joppatowne early Thursday afternoon. He was among a steady stream of boaters visiting the park, excited Hogan had lifted the restrictions on recreational boating. “Time to get out of the house before we go crazy,” Stifler said. “We might head out to Hart-Miller Island and make a day of it.” With a fishing trip on the Pocomoke coming up in a few weeks, Bel Air resident Andy Williams said he wanted to run his boat for a bit to make sure it was in good shape. He’s also been ready to get out of the house and on the water, but said Thursday he “wanted to play by the rules.” ”I’ve been on furlough for about two-and-a-half weeks and was anxious to get out, but I wasn’t going to break the law to do it," Williams said before launching his boat at Mariner Point. “And I couldn’t honestly say I was catching fish for food, because I catch-and-release, so that wouldn’t be right.” Tidewater Marina in Havre de Grace was also a very busy place on Thursday. General Manager Jeff Andrews said the governor’s announcement and 15 hours notice caught them by surprise. “We were really surprised that he did it that quick, when he’s been saying all along that he had certain criteria that he was going to lift the stay at home order and ban on boating at the same time. That’s what we were counting on,” Andrews said. But Andrews, along with owner Garrett Pensell and accountant Debbie Brandon, had been preparing to reopen, making sure they had cleaning supplies like gloves, masks and sanitizer when the time came. In the span of his12-minute drive to the marina from home after the announcement, Andrews said he received four emails from customers before the governor stopped talking. “We shut down March 30, that was the first full week of the launch schedule and its full until the middle of May, so we’ve got six weeks that we’re playing catch up with right now,” Andrews said. “We have less than a full staff, we’re trying to get as many guys in, we’re starting with our schedule where we left off and trying to just accelerate things so we can get people in the water. We’re just trying to launch boats as fast as we can and sanitize everything in the world.” Most Harford County parks have been open throughout the COVID-19 crisis, but county-owned playgrounds, fishing areas and other outdoor recreational facilities that had been closed were reopened Thursday, “On this beautiful spring day we are reopening all county-owned outdoor recreation spaces permitted yesterday by Gov. Hogan,” County Executive Barry Glassman said in a prepared statement issued Thursday morning. “Please remember to maintain social distancing and follow all safety precautions as you continue to enjoy Harford County’s public parks!” Aegis staffer Matt Button contributed to this article.

Mail-only voting makes sense during coronavirus pandemic, and maybe beyond | COMMENTARY
.W
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 21 states allow some elections to be carried out entirely by mail. Four of them — Oregon (since 2000), Washington (2011), Colorado (2013) and Hawaii (2019) — allow all elections to be conducted by mail, while others limit mail elections by county or type, like special elections. In fact, that’s generally how all-mail elections come to be: Some circumstance raises the need for them, and after a few smaller runs, they’re expanded because they work. Voters like the convenience, they often cost less, and several studies suggest they increase voter turnout — by as much as 12.5 points in Utah in 2016. And if anything should make the cut as a qualifying circumstance, coronavirus and its associated disease, COVID-19, certainly should. The World Health Organization officially classified the virus spread, now in at least 114 countries worldwide, as a “pandemic” on Wednesday, based on “the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction,” according to a statement from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director-general. The pandemic label is a warning that further community spread is coming, and officials should prepare. Already, 130,000 cases have been confirmed around the globe, and 5,000 people have died from it. That’s why it’s critical for Maryland officials to swiftly decide to hold a mail-only election for next month’s primary and how to do it. They should have done it weeks ago. Early voting is set for April 16th through 23rd, and Election Day is April 28th. There’s a strong chance “social distancing” could still be the norm by then, with businesses, schools and government agencies shut down or embracing telework models. Maryland law currently allows for mail-only elections during special elections that are not held concurrently with a regularly scheduled primary or general election (the special primary election held last month for candidates vying to succeed the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in Maryland’s 7th Congressional District would have qualified). But we wouldn’t need to change any laws to switch to all mail for the coming primary. Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency last week after announcing Maryland’s first confirmed case of coronavirus, which allows him to postpone elections if need be, or specify alternate voting means. Of course, doing it on the fly is not ideal, but lives are at stake; we’ve got to be prepared to take bold action at any point. Here’s how all-mail elections generally work: Every registered voter receives a ballot in the mail. The person marks it, puts it in a “secrecy envelope or sleeve,” puts that inside a separate envelope for mailing, signs an affidavit on the outside and sends the whole thing back, or drops it off at a designated location. Simple, right? Typically, there’s an opportunity for in-person voting in all-mail elections as well, for those who prefer that method or require it for some reason. But given the health concerns amid coronavirus, it’s unlikely Maryland would be able to adequately staff voting locations or even should. Election Day workers, much like the voters who most reliably turn out, are often older — the very population most at risk for serious complications from coronavirus. Maryland voters do already have the ability to vote by mail and can (and should) request absentee ballots now, regardless of the state’s decision (If you have a state issued ID or driver’s license, you can both register to vote and sign up to have an absentee ballot mailed to you online here: elections.maryland.gov/voting/absentee.html; the registration deadline is April 7th, and ballot request April 21st). One of the many significant lessons the coronavirus has imparted thus far is the importance of having solid, trustworthy leadership in times of crisis. And this is an important primary for Baltimore in particular, which is selecting a new mayor and City Council president. The city is overwhelmingly made up of Democrats, which means the primary winners in that party are extremely likely to ultimately win the the position in November’s general election. Voters will also make their choice for presidential nominees and many other political positions, including Cummings’ replacement in the short-term, and the party nominees for that spot in the general election. Voters should be given every opportunity to cast their vote in this critical time without having to also risk their lives. All-mail voting makes absolute sense in a pandemic, and it may make sense outside of one, as well. Some study would need to be done to determine the potential for fraud or coercion, the financial costs, the effects of slow counting and the possible unequal effects on different populations, including those who don’t have consistent mailing addresses.

McDaniels and writer Peter Jensen — offers opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers. It is separate from the newsroom.

From Baltimore’s rooftops, Adam Bouhmad has gotten a clearer view of the city while installing internet access points where many families can’t afford the high cost of high-speed service. Bouhmad is the founder of Project Waves, a nonprofit that installs Wi-Fi access and then asks families to pay what they can afford for the service — often $10 a month. Now, after the coronavirus pandemic shut down schools and forced students online, Bouhmad said everyone can see the city’s digital divide. “COVID really shines a light on this issue," said Bouhmad, 23. “Internet access has always been important ... without it, you’re at a severe disadvantage." School systems and tech organizations are rushing to provide computers to Baltimore students to get them connected to lessons. But the U.S. Census Bureau reported over a quarter of city households did not have a broadband internet subscription. Bouhmad, a Rosedale resident, said Baltimore has internet providers, but often the service isn’t affordable or available at every home. It’s why he founded Project Waves in 2018, after Congress repealed net neutrality rules. The Digital Harbor Foundation, where Bouhmad used to work, sponsors Project Waves. Bouhmad also teamed up with the Langston Hughes Community Center in Park Heights and No Boundaries Coalition in West Baltimore to understand what different neighborhoods need. Deborah Byers said the library was the only option for her to use the internet sometimes because she’s in a wheelchair. She and her husband, Bishop, learned about Project Waves when Bouhmad was passing out information in their South Baltimore neighborhood. The Byers have been a part of Project Waves ever since. ”Without Project Waves we wouldn’t have internet access at home," she said. Ed Mullin of the Baltimore Robotics Center said government orders asking Marylanders to stay home and practice social distancing make life harder for many residents if they don’t have access to a connection. When Mullin recently purchased antennas to provide internet access to the Pigtown and Hollins Market communities, he had Project Waves install the technology on the center’s rooftop. “Even if you have a device, it doesn’t help unless you have connectivity, and certain parts of the city are just broadband dead zones," Mullin said. “The folks there are very excited about having an option for their students." Waves hasn’t been an easy task for Bouhmad. The group handles installation and service expenses through grants and contributions. His organization relies on volunteers for labor and equipment from donors, which includes antennas, cable and firewall technology to protect people from unauthorized access. Bouhmad has spent $3,000 of his own money. But every set of antennas he installs could provide internet for hundreds of families. “It’s definitely been difficult,” Bouhmad said. “This is something that I’m going to do because this is something that needs to happen."

Howard County Council bill would provide rental protection for residents, businesses amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Howard County Council Chairwoman Deb Jung, Vice Chairwoman Liz Walsh and Councilwoman Christiana Mercer Rigby filed emergency legislation last week to protect and stabilize the rent of thousands of households and local businesses in the county. The Rental Protection and Stability Act would prevent residential and commercial landlords from increasing rents during the state of the emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic and for up to three months after it ends, the Democrats said. There are approximately 23,600 rental units in Howard County, according to a 2018 Howard County Rental Survey. The legislation also would prohibit landlords from decreasing promised services, like water or electricity, or from terminating existing leases, according to Walsh. “It seemed like everyone said they were going to do something, but no one was actually doing it,” Walsh said, referring to rental relief during the health emergency. “We’re just saying in this limited window the situation can’t be worse than it already is.” Less than a month ago, Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan announced a financial relief plan that included a possible 90 days’ deferral or even forbearance of mortgage payments. “For those of our constituents obligated to make monthly mortgage payments, Gov. Hogan’s announcement of the lenders’ initiative to temporarily defer or forbear those payments came as welcome relief,” Walsh said in a statement. “But, to date, there’s no corollary directly benefiting renters.” On Thursday, the same day Walsh and Jung filed their legislation, Montgomery County was voting on its COVID-19 Renter Relief Act. Montgomery County Councilman Will Jawando saw the lack of protection for renters in his county and introduced the bill. Jawando’s legislation was the baseline for the Howard County Rental Protection and Stability Act, according to Walsh and Jung. Jawando, a Democrat, said he had received calls from constituents who were getting rent renewal notices that had their rents increasing, in some cases by significant amounts. About one-third of Montgomery County residents are renters, according to Jawando. “I got a number of these cases. I looked into it and spoke to some of [constituents] and decided we needed to prohibit [rent increases],” Jawando said. “People are struggling enough during this time to pay their rent, let alone paying for an increase.” The legislation the Montgomery County Council ultimately passed prevents landlords from increasing rent beyond the county’s Department of Housing and Community Affairs’ guidelines of 2.6% for residential tenants for a period of 180 days after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. “We’ve never had any rent stabilization for any reason and now we do countywide, so that is a good thing,” Jawando said. “[The COVID-19 Renter Relief Act] will get rid of the more egregious increases.” Montgomery County’s bill only addressed residential tenants, not commercial ones, a group Walsh hopes the Howard County Council will agree to include. “If we’re trying to keep our economy going and we want these small businesses to return, giving them the best shot to do so is important,” Jawando said. Walsh said watching the process of Jawando’s legislation in Montgomery County helped guide how she, Rigby and Jung structured their bill. For example, Walsh included mobile home park residents as well. “I don’t doubt that there are many landlords who have passed along that relief and more to their own tenants, but I worry that there are other landlords who won’t, and some even who might seek to take economic advantage of their tenants even as evictions temporarily are stayed,” Walsh said. A virtual public hearing for the Rental Protection and Stability Act is set for 7 p.m. May 18; the earliest the council could vote on the legislation is June 1.

Maryland hospital system tells providers to save protective gear for coronavirus, avoid using it for MRSA patients
.W
The University of Maryland Medical System has sent a memo telling medical providers to preserve their protective equipment for COVID-19 cases and not to use it in treating some patients with potentially dangerous infections such as MRSA. The 13-hospital system isn’t alone in taking this or other such steps to ration protective gear, much of it directed or recommended by federal health authorities. But the memo nonetheless offers a look at how the shortage of personal protective equipment, known as PPE, is lacking in the Maryland hospitals, affecting policy and unsettling workers. “The change is a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” reads the memo dated Friday and provided to The Baltimore Sun by an alarmed medical provider. The memo explicitly says not to use “contact protections (gloves and gowns) with MRSA colonization and/or clinical infection for ALL patients." The hospital system implemented similar limits with VRE earlier. MRSA and VRE are often hard-to-treat bacterial infections spread by personal contact. But Dr. Gregory Schrank, infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland Medical Center, said Tuesday the memo applies only to routine care when there is a low risk to health care workers from the infections. Hospitals in Maryland and around the country have been struggling to maintain adequate supplies of gloves, gowns, masks and other equipment needed to shield workers from becoming infected themselves with the coronavirus as they treat a surge of patients. More than 14,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and about 600 have died in Maryland as of April 21. There have been more than 3,000 related hospitalizations in the state. To care for them, workers have been instructed on how to clean and reuse masks, for example, and have been taking donations of everything from homemade masks to 3D-printed face shields. At the University of Maryland system hospitals, staff members have been keeping close count of equipment so it can be moved where it is most needed, system officials said. Schrank, also an incident commander for the hospital’s COVID-19 response, said the MRSA decision was made after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released strategies for optimizing supplies. It’s one of several policy changes to preserve protective gear, such as using plastic face shields — which can be more easily cleaned — over masks. “Everyone is putting policies in place to help preserve PPE,” he said. “This is one component, and everything is within CDC guidance.” MRSA is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria that can infect different parts of the body and can be harder to treat than other staph infections because it is resistant to common antibiotics. VRE is Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, a bacteria that is resistant to a specific antibiotic and can infect a woman’s genital tract and the bloodstream. Both infections can be passed from person to person. And both can become deadly. Because of this, Schrank said, workers should “absolutely” wear gloves if there are fluids or wounds involved that make transmission more likely. Otherwise studies show that other measures such as hand washing are sufficient, he said. Protection of workers and patients is the top priority, he said, adding the system has been “ahead of the curve” on policies to stem COVID-19 infections. Workers wear protections whenever they are near patients with confirmed cases or suspected cases, he said, but in other situations the system thoroughly assesses risks and makes policy changes. Jania Matthews, a university system spokeswoman, said the hospital system continues to acquire more protective gear and take donations from companies such as Under Armour. The sports apparel company said it would make more than 500,000 masks, assemble and distribute 1,000 face shields and make thousands of hospital gowns for the university system hospitals and others in Baltimore. The scramble for supplies has become a national issue, with governors complaining of having to bid against one another in the absence of a federal plan. Bob Atlas, CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association, said the hospitals are getting protective equipment with help from the state and downplayed any threats to staff. He said hospitals are equipped to isolate and treat patients with a variety of infectious diseases without harming the patients or other patients, visitors and staff. “There are different processes and precautions in place for various care settings,” Atlas said. “For example, team members testing and treating COVID-19 patients will have full personal protective equipment and may get their temperature taken before and after shifts to ensure the care providers are safe. Those working with immunocompromised patients will wear a mask and gloves to ensure the patients are protected from the care providers.” Atlas did acknowledge “challenges” in obtaining protective equipment. “Maryland hospitals are seeing the same equipment challenges that hospitals across the country are facing,” he said. “They are making considerable efforts to get as much personal protective equipment as possible — working with their own supply chain providers and the state to quickly bring in additional material.” Governors in various states have complained that the federal government hasn’t taken steps to ensure states get the gear they need. For their part, federal officials say they have sent protective equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile to every state, though some of it turned out to be past its “use by” date. Charles Gischlar, a spokesman for the state health department, confirmed the state has gotten federal deliveries. “The Maryland Department of Health receives ongoing shipments of PPE from the Strategic National Stockpile, as well as through private industry donations,” he said in an emailed statement. “Although PPE shortages remain a challenge, MDH continues to search for ways to conserve PPE and maintain reliable supply sources.” Separately Wednesday, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh joined with attorneys general from 18 other states to urge PPE maker 3M to do more to combat price gouging by its distributors, including by ceasing to do business with those who violate 3M’s price gouging policies. Hogan has said that the supplies on hand at hospitals are insufficient. He said adequate protective equipment constitutes a pillar of his strategy for eventually reopening the state by lifting restrictions on businesses, schools and individuals. The other pillars are widespread testing for COVID-19, tracing contacts to identify those who may be infected and expanding hospital capacity. He took a step Monday to boost testing with the $9 million purchase of 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea with the aid of his Korean-born wife, Yumi Hogan, though the step drew the ire of President Donald Trump. Hogan has not yet outlined a plan to increase protective gear. In a statement Monday about the tests, Hogan said he would introduce a “Roadmap to Recovery” later in the week touching on all the necessary steps. “This recovery plan has four building blocks, including a robust contact tracing operation, increasing our supply of PPE, and increasing hospital surge capacity,” he said. “Our team is making significant progress on each of these criteria.”

What are your rights as a renter in Baltimore? A FAQ on rent during coronavirus outbreak
.W
As the coronavirus outbreak has kept businesses throughout Maryland closed, some left unemployed or without a paycheck are scrambling to find ways to pay rent. With landlords still threatening to incur late fees and eviction once the state’s courts reopen, here’s what those people need to know about their rights as a Maryland renter or mortgage payer during the COVID-19 outbreak. Do I still have to pay rent during the outbreak? Most likely, yes, as there is no statewide rent freeze in Maryland like in some other municipalities such as parts of Los Angeles. The executive order Gov. Larry Hogan signed last month places a moratorium on evictions if the tenant can prove they’ve “suffered a substantial loss of income resulting from COVID-19” or the various closures mandated by the state in response to the outbreak. He extended that order earlier this month, also adding a provision that prohibits foreclosures on homes during the coronavirus pandemic. However, the order did not freeze rent payments nor stop landlords from incurring late fees as a result of missed payments. While city governments can vote to freeze rent payments for privately-owned residences, like Washington D.C.'s city council did this week, no such bill has been passed in Baltimore. While the state has not frozen rent for those who live in private housing, there may be solutions for those who live in federal housing. Under the $2 trillion coronavirus response bill signed by President Donald Trump last week, homeowners with federally backed mortgage loans can request payments be postponed for up to 180 days. Homeowners can then request a second 180 postponement, if needed. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to suspend foreclosures and evictions for at least 60 days for some mortgages. Borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac also can suspend payments for 12 months. Similar mortgage relief programs are being offered for those with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration or for VA loans through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Can I be evicted for not paying? Yes, but not right now. Hogan’s executive order prohibits any eviction process from proceeding in state courts while his emergency orders restricting people in public places and closing businesses are in place. However, once the orders are lifted and courts are reopened, eviction procedures can continue. I lost my job and there’s no way I can pay rent. What should I do? First, you should file for unemployment, as those laid off because of a loss of business or production tied to the outbreak are eligible for unemployment benefits. Some people who have been ordered by a doctor or public health official to isolate themselves may also be eligible for unemployment benefits, according to the state labor department. People can also file for unemployment if their workplace is closed because of social distancing orders, even if they haven’t been formally laid off from their jobs. And the federal COVID-19 stimulus legislation, the CARES Act, also offers unemployment to a sector of the economy not traditionally eligible for the benefits — the self-employed. Maryland’s system is not yet set up to process those claims, Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci said, adding that labor officials hope to have that up and running the week of April 13. Both part-time and full-time workers can be eligible for unemployment benefits. Unemployment claims can be submitted online through the state Labor Department website, or by phone from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. weekdays. Claimants are asked to provide basic information, including name, Social Security number, address and telephone number; and employment information, including employer contact information and the reason for leaving each job held within the past 18 months. Anyone who works for the federal government or who has worked outside of Maryland for any part of the past 18 months must file for unemployment by phone, though Ricci said labor officials are looking to allow more people the ability to file online. For faster service, state labor officials are encouraging people to stagger when they call or go online to request assistance, with last names A through F filing on Mondays, last names G through N filing on Tuesdays and last names O through Z filing on Wednesdays and all names on Thursday and Friday. Marylanders will be helped whenever they file, but officials hope the voluntary system could help spread out the unprecedented surge of claims. Freeman said the state is working with employers who are ordering mass layoffs to smooth the unemployment claims process for those workers, collecting lists of names directly from the employers. To continue receiving the benefits, recipients must report any income and, typically, they must also document that they are regularly searching for new work. But Robinson said the state is waiving the work search requirement during the coronavirus pandemic. Maryland had about $1.3 billion in the fund from which it pays unemployment benefits as of the beginning of the year, according to federal data. At that level, the state is at risk of needing to borrow federal money to meet its unemployment benefit obligations, ranking 37th among states on a measure of fund solvency, according to a U.S. Department of Labor report. Whether that becomes necessary will depend on how long coronavirus-related business closures last. Are there other resources available? Renters should call their landlords to discuss their payment options. The Federal Housing Finance Agency announced Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will offer multifamily property owners mortgage forbearance if they suspend evictions for renters unable to pay rent due to the coronavirus. Homeowners need to contact their mortgage servicer to see if they qualify for a mortgage relief program. See your most recent monthly statement for your mortgage lender or servicer’s website and consumer contact information. If you do not have your statement, use the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System to search for the company by name. Expect long waiting times as servicers are likely dealing with many inquiries at this time. Have your loan statement ready and know how much your income has been reduced and what your weekly unemployment benefits are. The Maryland Bankers Association has an online list of what its member banks are doing to help customers. Likewise, the American Bankers Association released an online list of the banks offering payment deferrals with no late fees for mortgage and home equity loans. If you have an inquiry or complaint about a mortgage lender or servicer, contact the Maryland Department of Labor by email at DLFRComplaints-LABOR@maryland.gov or by phone at 410-230-6077. The Maryland HOPE Initiative (Home Owners Preserving Equity) also has resources to help you keep your home. Call HOPE at 1-877-462-7555. The Fair Housing Act is now directing people to the organization’s housing intake form online after initially offering a slew of county and municipality-specific resources to help Marylanders with rent. Carol Ott, the organization’s Tenant Advocacy Director, wrote in an email that the fact sheet was taken down “because most of the organizations had closed due to COVID-19, or their funds were tapped out pretty quickly.” The center is also continuing to update their website with relevant information for residents, business owners and property managers. United Way of Central Maryland is collecting donations to help people cover rent. Are other cities or states freezing rent? Oakland, California, is temporarily freezing rent until at least the end of May. But rent will still be owed after the freeze is lifted, leaving some to call for the owed payments to be permanently forgiven. In New York, although Gov. Andrew Cuomo sought to suspend mortgage payments for single-family homes, he has only postponed rent payments, meaning they’ll still be owed after the crisis has passed. But New York legislators have proposed forgiving 90 days’ worth of those payments completely, as well as offering mortgage relief to landlords whose tenants are impacted. Late fees would also be forgiven. Specifically in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to ban any increases in rent this year for the city’s 1 million rent-regulated apartments — a move that would require state approval. In Massachusetts, Boston and Springfield legislators are considering similar measures. Seattle City Council also passed a non-binding resolution calling for relief. At the national level, the site Rent Strike 2020 — organized by left-leaning groups such as the Socialists Alternative and the Rose Caucus — has created petitions calling on each state to enact a rent freeze, or risk a strike. Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are also calling for a rent freeze and the forgiving of back rent. The Chicago Tribune contributed to this report.

Amid coronavirus pandemic, Maryland DACA recipients face another uncertainty: imminent Supreme Court ruling
.W
Jonathan Rodas rushes in and out of operating rooms in a hospital in Towson, delivering bloodwork to labs, cleaning surgical tools, pushing gurneys and sometimes holding the hands of scared patients. Like many working in hospitals during the pandemic, the 25-year-old can’t help but imagine he might catch the coronavirus. He prays that he won’t get his mother and brothers sick. But Rodas faces another layer of uncertainty in the midst of the pandemic. He’s one of more than 8,000 young immigrants in Maryland without permanent legal status who could face deportation and lose their work permits if the U.S. Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to end the federal program known as DACA. A ruling appears imminent. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals gives some 700,000 “Dreamers” the right to stay and work in this country. Many of them are young working professionals or students whose families brought them to the United States as children. The Trump administration argued to the nine justices in November that ending DACA was “reasonable” because the Obama administration policy was illegal in the first place. The parties mounting legal challenges said the abrupt ending of DACA was unjustified. While it’s possible a ruling could be postponed until the next term, the justices are expected to make a decision before the end of June. Immigration attorneys say it can happen any week. “That really freaks me out because my whole life is here,” said Rodas, who was brought to Maryland as an 11-year-old by his mother. She feared he and his brother would be killed or recruited into gangs in El Salvador. Now, he is a full-time operating room support assistant and nursing student at the Community College of Baltimore County. “This is where I have my family, my friends.” Those who work closely with immigrants say that eliminating the program would have ripple effects in the communities where they have deep roots. Not only are they already vulnerable in many ways, with less access to health care and government services, but many also are working in key professions across the country, advocates say. "They are our children’s teachers, our health care workers, and an essential part of our economy and community,” said Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, the Baltimore director for CASA, an advocacy group for Latino and immigrant people in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. About 60% of all DACA recipients are part of Maryland’s workforce. The most common industries of employment are food prep, sales, office and administrative, health care and health care support, construction, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Despite his uncertain future, Rodas says he feels compelled to assist the nurses he looks up to, and make sure patients get the care they need. “This was my calling,” the Halethorpe man said. “I want to help people out.” Another DACA recipient, Missael Garcia, not only works at an elementary school, but also is a longtime community leader, volunteering at a local food bank during the pandemic. “I consider myself part of this city — part of this country, to be honest,” said Garcia, 29, who moved to Baltimore from Mexico when he was 12. Before DACA, Garcia worked in construction, hotels and restaurants. The introduction of DACA in 2012 opened new opportunities for him. Under the initiative, undocumented immigrants were eligible to work legally and shielded from deportation if they met a set of requirements, passed a stringent background check, and paid a $500 application fee to renew it every two years. Garcia is now a teaching assistant for English language learners at Lakeland Elementary/Middle school, where he’s mentored students for two years. “I found my place where I belong, and I love it,” Garcia said. But he’s worried about providing for his wife and two daughters. The imminent decision during the pandemic has left him in a state of anguish. “It’s very overwhelming,” Garcia said. “I cannot afford to be sick. I cannot afford to not have a job.” While the coronavirus crisis has upended life for everyone, Nick Katz, legal program manager at CASA, says DACA recipients and other undocumented immigrants have been hit particularly hard because they don’t have the same access to government resources. DACA recipients pay taxes but are not eligible for public benefits such as cash assistance, food stamps or Medicaid. They are not eligible to apply for health insurance through the Maryland Health Connection, according to the state department of health. And on Wednesday, DACA students were left out of the federal emergency aid plan by the U.S. Department of Education. Critics argue that DACA should be terminated because it entices parents to stay in the country without authorization. “The fact that they have been allowed to stay and allowed to work sends a message all around the world to parents, that it's worth it to come here on vacation and then never leave,” said Roy Beck, President of NumbersUSA, a low-immigration advocacy group in Virginia. Beck acknowledges that ending DACA will cause a disruption to the lives of many. But he believes it could force the president and Congress to come up with a permanent solution, something he argues would stop people from entering the workforce illegally. It was such sentiments that helped drive the Trump administration’s move to end DACA in 2017. But lower courts blocked the plan, and the case wound all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. During oral arguments in November, the U.S. Justice Department said the government was within its right to end DACA because it was meant to be a “temporary stopgap measure” and the policy in itself violated federal immigration law. The challengers argued that the government failed to provide a legally sound explanation for abruptly ending a government program that was supported and implemented for five years. In a November tweet, President Donald Trump said he would strike a deal for DACA recipients with Democrat lawmakers if the justices allow the program to end. Advocates worry that would mean more immigration enforcement, which would break apart the “Dreamers” from their families, many of whom are undocumented. The Public Information Office of the Supreme Court did not respond to requests for information on the case. The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment “due to ongoing litigation.” And with the coronavirus, the case has stirred more attention. In April, members of Congress, including Maryland’s Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, sent a letter urging Trump to automatically extend work authorizations for DACA recipients and other immigrants. On April 20, the Supreme Court accepted a new filing by lawyers for the DACA recipients, asking the court to consider the “catastrophic” impact that ending the program would have on the economy and on public health measures. It remains unclear whether the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency plans to go after DACA recipients based on the Supreme Court decision. In an email, a spokesperson for ICE pointed to a March statement that says the agency will focus enforcement on “public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.” Meanwhile, those with DACA protection try to put it out of their minds and focus on the day-to-day. Garcia is most concerned with helping his fifth and sixth graders with the challenges that come with online learning and raising his 2-year-old daughter. “I’m a man of faith, I’m a man of God,” Garcia said, “and I know he’s gonna help us overcome everything that is happening.” Meanwhile, Rodas tries to stay positive and reminds himself of why he shows up to the hospital every day. “I’m here because patients need our help,” Rodas said Thursday, during a break. “I wish I could do more.” He plans to finish the spring semester virtually and keep patients calm in a chaotic situation, for as long as he’s able.

Maryland man allegedly boasted about online drug operation running ‘at full speed’ despite coronavirus, FBI says
.W
ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A Maryland man has been arrested after federal prosecutors accused him of selling large-scale quantities of narcotics and other drugs over the internet. William Burgamy, 32, of Hanover, Maryland, was arrested Thursday and charged with illegal distribution of controlled substances and money laundering in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. An FBI affidavit states Burgamy operated a business on the Darknet called NeverPressedRX that sold oxycodone and other narcotics over the internet without a prescription. Court papers do not specify the volume of transactions, but show Burgamy regularly exchanged thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin used in the purchases for U.S. currency. Burgamy boasted on his vendor page late last month that, “Even with Corona Virus the shop is running at full speed.” He told an undercover FBI agent he had a number of medications available, but was waiting for a shipment because the coronavirus outbreak had hurt his inventory, according to court documents. Undercover FBI employees made multiple controlled purchases of drugs from the site, which were sent to addresses in northern Virginia, according to the affidavit. U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia G. Zachary Terwilliger, whose office is prosecuting the case, praised officers in a written statement “for moving forward with this public safety investigation amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,” Burgamy is being held pending an initial appearance scheduled for Friday. Online court records do not list an attorney for Burgamy.

Dining manager who worked at University of Maryland for 30 years dies from coronavirus
.W
A 30-year employee of the University of Maryland, College Park died Thursday from complications from the coronavirus, the first death at the state’s flagship university caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. A dining manager for the past 13 years, Luckmann Simon was beloved by his campus colleagues and friends, University President Wallace D. Loh wrote in an email to students, faculty and staff. “On behalf of the University, I offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Marie Lourdes, and to his entire family," the university president wrote. "And to those who knew and worked with Mr. Simon, may your memories of him bring you peace and strength.” Reached by phone, Simon’s wife said she was not immediately available Friday morning. Simon had not been on campus since March 23 and did not have contact with or serve food to the last remaining students on campus, Loh wrote. “Because it has been more than 14 days since he was last here, health officials informed us that there is no risk of infection to anyone who has been on campus,” Loh wrote. The university president urged the community to comfort each other “in our grief and fears, even though we must remain physically distant from each other at the same time.” “We are connected as fellow human beings," he wrote. "No pathogen is going to make us strangers to each other. Together, we will make it through.”

Baltimore’s Federal Hill Prep School drive thru event reunites teachers, students during coronavirus pandemic
.W
After about a month of virtual play dates and distance learning, Federal Hill Preparatory School first grader, Cooper Bruchey was able to see many of his teachers and classmates in real life despite the coronavirus stay-at-home order. He and his school friends visited — all from the safe distance on a sidewalk near the school —while their teachers drove by. About 30 teachers from Cooper’s school participated in the Bee Happy: Neighborhood Drive Thru. The staff spent Wednesday afternoon in their cars waving, smiling and beeping their way throughout a two-mile loop that included the Sharp-Leadenhall, Otterbein and Federal Hill neighborhoods. Some teachers attached balloons or garland to their cars. Organizers said that they reached 120 families whose children attend the school. The event was fun for the teachers and the kids and a welcome break for parents. “We’re doing it because we miss our kids,” said music teacher and organizer, Tess Owen, who got the idea after seeing similar efforts on social media from around the country. Owen and the school notified parents about the event last week. Parents were told to practice social distancing while standing with their children along the caravan route. “We are all wishing we could be back together in our school building so just being able to see each other—even from a distance—is exciting,” Owen added. The school has provided daily virtual lessons and assignments throughout the COVID-19 crisis. And parents said that their children had been able to communicate through virtual play dates and via technology. But the experience of seeing members of their school community in real life made the day special. “We weren’t sure if it would work for us since our school is located downtown and it’s not a traditional neighborhood,” said Owen, who led the caravan of 25 vehicles, including a Baltimore City Police Department escort car. “It was so much fun. All the feedback was that [this] was needed. We were shocked by how many kids showed up. We had kids at every spot on the route. “ Cooper, 6, said it felt “good” because “I could see my friends again. He admitted to being sad during the time away from school so far. Cooper’s parents, Ann-Marie and Ryan Bruchey, appreciated the school’s effort. “It was just heart-warming,” Ann-Marie Bruchey said. “It made my son’s day. It was a wonderful idea for the children.” She added: “[My husband] thought it was great. He said, ‘that was really amazing.’” Anat Gimburg’s husband, Yury, took their children, Raviv, a 7-year-old first grader, and Matan, a 4-year-old pre-schooler to see their teachers on parade. “I thought it was pretty thoughtful for them [to do,]” Anat Gimburg said. “It’s hard for the kids to express all the differences [they are experiencing.] They miss their friends. And they miss the structure. Any sort of opportunity to feel connected back to their school community is a nice thing." Raviv said seeing his teachers was the highlight of the day. “We haven’t seen them in a while in person,” he explained. “We wouldn’t get to for another month because of coronavirus.” He also misses seeing his school friends. “It’s sad because [I’m] used to seeing my friends a lot of days in a row. And it’s just sad because I don’t get to see anybody that much.” The event was a change of pace for the entire Gimburg family as they have sheltered at home, balancing work and family. Anat Gimburg is an architect and her husband, Yury, works in finance. “It’s definitely a challenge," she said. "It’s a daily coordination. We map out our calendars and trade off being with the kids and being on [work] calls. There are a lot of late nights. We try and keep the weekends work-free. It’s tough,” she said. “We do recognize how fortunate we are. We are healthy. In a lot of ways, we feel very fortunate. “

Harford restaurants are adapting amid coronavirus pandemic and shutdown; some worry about long-term survival
.W
Box Hill Pizzeria in Abingdon, known for its crab cakes and New England style pizza, has been in business in Harford County for more than three decades. The impact of the new coronavirus on restaurants is something owner Tom Kanaras and others haven’t experienced before. "We have been through two recessions. We have been here 35 years and we have never had to lose anybody,” Kanaras said Friday. “At this point, we are just trying to cover the payroll — making sure, at least, everybody can survive.” In accordance with Gov. Larry Hogan’s order, the Box Hill closed its dining room March 16, but has been offering curbside pick-up options to hungry customers, though at a great loss to business, Kanaras said. The restaurant is maintaining normal hours but not serving alcohol. Orders can be placed online or over the phone. Kanaras said the closure has hit his business and staff hard. Some of his employees have worked at the storied restaurant for 20 or more years, and he wants to keep them afloat during these challenging times. To keep as many of his workers employed as he can, Kanaras is spreading hours between those he can so everybody at least gets some work. Customers have offered compassionate messages to the restaurant and those who are out of work or have been affected by the spread of COVID-19, Kanaras said. He feels responsible for his workers’ well-being and thanked customers for their support. "It is a time for faith and hope and sticking together,” he said. “It is scary, and I don’t have any answers." That uncertainty isn’t lost on other Harford County restaurateurs, some of whom wonder how long they can survive in the current climate. Lou Ward, owner of The Bayou Restaurant in Havre de Grace, said business has “improved a little bit each day,” since the restaurant had to close its dining room and move to a carryout model, but they’ve already lost a lot of perishable items and doesn’t plan to purchase new items, fearing closure and losing product. “We’ll see how things go,” he said. Some places have innovated in order to keep business afloat. Two Havre de Grace restaurants, Coakley’s Pub and River City Public House, have teamed up to offer a “Pub on the Run” at Hutchins Park, using the Laurrapin catering trailer as a food truck, opening at noon for walk-up business. Bruce Clarke, the owner of the recently opened River City and Laurrapin Caterers, said “by no means do I want to be a food truck business,” but with the catering business on hold, “we thought we’d put the catering trailer to use and kind of help get us through this.” The two businesses were given a week by the city’s mayor, William T. Martin, to try out the experiment, as long as people were not congregating and were practicing social distancing. “The city has been over the top supportive of everyone, every business in town, including us in doing something remote like this,” said Will Nori, restaurateur of Coakley’s Pub. “It’s been steady, people are minding the social distancing. We have a sign posted and people are standing six feet apart. We’ve never had a huge line of people, but I’d say we’ve been steady.” Nori said they’ve been fortunate to be able to move their product and not throw food away. "If we go further with this into a lockdown situation, we're gonna try and make a hard press to prepare a bunch of food and then reach out to some of the unfortunate people in the community,” he said. “Just give meals to people … we can try to take care of the people here in Havre de Grace." Both River City and Coakley’s are offering carry-out orders by phone. River City is hoping to add online delivery next week. "If we could double our carry-out business, we will be fine,” general manager David Vazquez said. Others are less optimistic about their long-term survival. Joe Borkoski, whose wife Wendy owns Eats & Sweets in Pylesville, said the restaurant was offering pick-up and carry-out options for customers and considering adding curbside pickup. Their situation, Borkoski said, is rough. Usually, the restaurant ends every other Friday with 20 names on its payroll; this next pay period, however, will only have three. "If it is beyond this month, I mean, we will probably have to file bankruptcy and close the doors," Borkoski said. Thankfully, most of the eatery's workers were not reliant on the paycheck the received from the shop, and Borkoski scheduled two older workers who needed the money to continue working during the coronavirus spread. He and his wife are not drawing a paycheck, and their daughter is also working in the restaurant. Borkoski said the restaurant has lost approximately 65% to 75% of its normal business — one day pulling in less than $300 over the full day. Support from the community has been encouraging, he said, but it can only help so much. "The community can only help us out so much," he said. "If this keeps on going, the community is going to be in the same situation we are in." Scott Opdyke, general manager of The Lodge in Hickory, said if the shutdown of Maryland eateries continues, the restaurant would be unsustainable between the costs of doing business, the lease on the building, payroll and other expenses. "I have had to lay off about 40 people," he said softly, "people that have worked here a decade." The restaurant is running on truncated hours — 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays — Opdyke said, and management is trying to keep as many people working as possible. The restaurant is offering carryout and delivery of food, beer and wine. It did not previously deliver, Opdyke said. "We are just trying to keep as many as we can working,” he said. "The community has been very generous with their gratuity, their tips, so it has been really nice.” Still, business has plummeted, Opdyke said; the restaurant is doing about 17% of the business it normally would do. The management could not predict the precipitous decline. "A few of us had a gut feeling that this is going to get pretty ugly ... none of us have ever seen anything like this,” he said. Opdyke asked for the community’s continued patronage as the restaurant negotiates the pandemic. “Everybody in the country just bought six months of toilet paper and groceries,” he said. “We are just doing what we can here.” At Alecraft brewery in downtown Bel Air, co-owner Eryn Streett sat at a table in the nearly empty taproom Friday afternoon. She was putting together a customer newsletter with the latest updates on coronavirus and its impact on AleCraft, while watching CNN on a nearby wall-mounted television blaring news about the pandemic. Beer-tender Deana Fornoff was behind the bar, helping customers as they purchased beer in to-go cans. People cannot sit in the taproom and drink a pint, but they can pick up to-go orders, according to Streett. Bel Air resident Colin Mitchell came in to purchase a four-pack of beer. “I enjoy their beer,” he said of AleCraft. “I usually try to get here once a week to come to the tap room for a few, but you can’t do that right now, so I wanted to come get some to-go beer.” Alecraft’s taproom at 319 S. Main St., which is in the same building as Preston’s Stationery, has been closed to the public since 5 p.m. Monday, in accordance with the governor’s order, but customers can visit from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and purchase beer in a four-pack of to-go cans, or get their growler bottles and crowler cans filled. Beer is still being brewed at AleCraft, but “we’ve just been canning all of the beer for to-go sales,” Streett said. The owners are developing a page where people can place orders online — customers can purchase gift cards online now. In addition to the taproom and brewery, the building also houses a shop for homebrewing supplies — the Streetts started their homebrew supply operation in 2013. Many customers have been coming in to purchase homebrew supplies in anticipation of a long stay at home to avoid spreading the virus. Some are teachers who expect they will not return to school for the rest of the current semester, according to Streett. She noted regular customers have been placing orders “to help support us,” so the owners can keep paying their employees while they run with a limited staff. Adrienne DeRan, of Pylesville, stopped into Savona bistro on Main Street in Bel Air on Friday afternoon to pick up a drink and some pizza sauce, planning to make pizza for her daughter’s seventh birthday on Saturday. She had to cancel the birthday party planned for her daughter because people cannot get together in large groups. “She wants to have pizza, so we’ll make it happen,” DeRan said. Savona, which will celebrate its 15th anniversary in June, is known for its Italian food and wine. Owner Maria DeRan she could not purchase her desired cans of Don Pepino pizza sauce, pointing out two cans resting on the counter which were the last she had in stock, and those had been reserved for another customer. DeRan ended up getting a can of Pepino’s spaghetti sauce instead. "If we want our local businesses to be around, we need to support them, and we appreciate you guys for being here and being open,” she told Boeri. Boeri became emotional as DeRan stressed how such businesses are a crucial community resource. “It’s a resource, truly,” DeRan said. Savona customers can get orders to go, either by picking them up in the store or an employee will bring orders to their vehicle at the curb; they can place orders online through services such as Grubhub and DoorDash. Boeri said she is “not really” participating in deliveries of alcoholic beverages now, but customers have been purchasing cases of wine available in store. “People have been so supportive,” said Boeri, who became emotional when talking about how the community has rallied to support her and other Bel Air business owners. “People come in and say, ‘We want to buy a case of wine to support small businesses.'" Customers have purchased other items in bulk such as bread, produce and Savona’s famed meatballs in frozen packages. “People are hunkering down, and it’s an easy meal,” Boeri said of the meatballs. Boeri lamented how she has not been able to hug or shake hands with anyone other than family members as people try to maintain personal space. She recalled one customer sending her an email about purchasing gift certificates. “I emailed him back and said, ‘I have a hug waiting for you when I can,’” she said.

Big Ten cancels sports competitions for rest of academic year amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Amid concerns over the coronavirus, now labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the Big Ten Conference on Thursday announced that it was cancelling “all conference and non-conference competitions through the end of the academic year, including spring sports that compete beyond the academic year, and participation in all NCAA tournaments and competitions.” Earlier Thursday, the conference announced it was canceling the remainder of the men’s basketball tournament. In addition, the Big Ten announced a moratorium on all on- and off-campus recruiting activities “for the foreseeable future.” The conference’s decision to halt spring sports followed the NCAA’s announcement on Thursday to cancel its remaining winter and sports championships, including the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments. The other Power 5 conferences — the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Southeastern Conference, the Pac-12 Conference and the Big 12 Conference — announced one-by-one that they would be suspending their spring sports competitions. “This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to the spread of the pandemic and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during the academic year given the ongoing decisions by other entities,” the NCAA said in statement. The Big Ten initially announced Wednesday that it would continue to hold its conference tournament as planned. After NCAA president Mark Emmert later announced that the Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments would be held without spectators, the Big Ten reversed course and announced attendance at its conference tournament would be limited to student-athletes, coaches, event staff, essential team and conference staff, TV network partners, credentialed media, and immediate family members of the participating teams. The Big Ten played the first two games of its tournament Wednesday night with spectators allowed to watch the matches between Northwestern and Minnesota, and Nebraska and Indiana. The Maryland men’s basketball team had a double-bye in the Big Ten tournament and was scheduled to play its first game Friday evening. “I understand and respect the conference’s decision to cancel this year’s Big Ten tournament,” Maryland men’s basketball coach Mark Turgeon wrote Thursday in a social media post. “The health and safety of our student-athletes and entire program is paramount. This is an unprecedented situation that is much bigger than basketball. I remain hopeful that a resolution will be found to provide our student-athletes with the opportunity to complete their season.” Some members of the Maryland men’s basketball team have reacted to the news. “Woww......this can’t be real at all,” sophomore forward Jalen Smith wrote on Twitter. Smith, who earlier in the week was named First Team All-Big Ten, is a projected first-round pick in the 2020 NBA draft and could forego his remaining eligibility for the pros. Maryland’s Pro Day, scheduled for March 25, has been “postponed until further notice,” and all football spring practices are “suspended until further notice,” a spokesperson for the team confirmed. The 68-team field for the men’s tournament is scheduled to be announced Sunday and the 64-team women’s tournament field is to be unveiled Monday. Games begin Tuesday and Wednesday on the men’s side in Dayton, Ohio, where earlier Wednesday the governor ordered to restrict spectator access to indoor sporting events. As concern over the spread of the coronavirus increases, it continues to impact the world of sports. The NBA announced the suspension of games Wednesday night after a player from the Utah Jazz, reported to be center Rudy Gobert, tested positive for the coronavirus. Wednesday night’s game between the Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder was suspended and members from the Jazz were subsequently tested for COVID-19. ESPN reported Thursday morning that Jazz star Donovan Mitchell has also tested positive for the coronavirus.

Rep. Harris compares Maryland to N. Korea, delegate sues Hogan as opponents protest coronavirus restrictions
.W
Dozens of Marylanders again demonstrated against Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home order, embarking on a caravan from Western Maryland to the lower Eastern Shore on Saturday. The ReOpen Maryland group planned the protest against the governor’s mandates after holding one in downtown Annapolis last month. Hogan’s stay-at home order is part of the Republican governor’s measures to deter the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed at least 1,156 in the state as of Saturday morning. “Unbelievably, in America, I have been told that you can’t practice your religion and the state has decided that my religion is essential or nonessential,” Republican Rep. Andy Harris told protesters assembled in a Salisbury parking lot at the final stop. The speech was broadcast on the Facebook page of Patriot Picket, a gun rights advocacy group. “I didn’t wake up in Communist China and I didn’t wake up in North Korea … and tomorrow morning, I should be able to go to the church of my choice and worship the way I choose,” he said. Later in the day, ReOpen Maryland took its protest to federal court, joining Del. Dan Cox, a Frederick Republican, and several churches and businesses in a lawsuit asking that Hogan’s restrictions be invalidated. The plaintiffs argue that their right to travel, free speech and assembly have been violated, and that businesses have sustained deep losses because of what they call unlawful orders. The lengthy lawsuit and accompanying request for injunction touch on a range of what they call constitutional violations, including the right to practice their religion. And the plaintiffs say that because the state’s top judge has curtailed many court functions, they have no ability to contest Hogan’s actions in Maryland’s courts. Hogan addressed the protests Sunday during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union." “I think everybody has a right to protest and express their feelings,” Hogan said. “A couple of dozen people did so yesterday and they have every right to do that. Sadly, we had far more people die yesterday in Maryland than we had protesters.” Hogan also addressed Harris’ fiery comments, stating he believed the congressman may have confused North Korea with South Korea. “South Korea’s done a great job on testing and we just saved the lives of thousands of Marylanders by getting those half million tests from Korea,” Hogan said. “He’s obviously got the right to say whatever crazy things he wants to say but I don’t really need to respond to him.” On their drive from Frederick, the protesters made multiple stops. Group members had said they would follow social distancing guidelines by remaining in their vehicles, but many did not. “One big reason we are in a position to consider reopening Maryland is because of social distancing, so the reports from today’s demonstration are confusing, if not disturbing — especially given that a Member of Congress was present," Mike Ricci, spokesperson for Hogan, said in a statement. “The overwhelming majority of Marylanders are doing what they need to do to get us all through this, and we are grateful to them and all of the healthcare heroes we are celebrating today,” referring to Hogan declaring Saturday “Healthcare Heroes Day.” Hogan has also ordered the closure of all nonessential businesses. The state reported 37,225 unemployment claims for last week, continuing a historic spike since the beginning of the pandemic. At a lunch stop on Kent Island, James Knowles of Queen Anne’s County said, “We should’ve had the opportunity to adhere to certain rules and regulations rather than be shut down. My point is all businesses should have been reviewed before the essential, nonessential was distinguished.” Similar demonstrations have occurred nationwide, and leaders of several states used the start of a new month Friday to begin reopening their states. President Donald Trump praised protests, notably one in Michigan where conservative activists brandished swastikas, nooses, Confederate flags and weapons at the state capital building, the Associated Press reports. Hogan has said he won’t initiate his phased plan to reopen Maryland until the state sees downward trends or plateauing in hospitalizations and patients in intensive care, previously noting the state would need to see such trends for 14 days. Guidelines issued by the Trump administration last month also mentioned a 14-day downward trajectory. Maryland hasn’t reported fewer than 128 new hospitalizations since April 15, with Saturday’s 192 new patients the third-highest increase in that span. Maryland’s 14-day rolling average of new victims has yet to decrease, while the state has never reported more than two consecutive days in which the number of new confirmed cases was lower than the day prior. Jeff Hulbert, the founder of Patriot Picket, said responsibility for defending against the virus does not lie with government. “We believe in personal responsibility,” said the Annapolis resident. “What Governor Hogan should be doing is setting the guidelines and the guardrails, then we put on our personal protective equipment, we go to work, we go shopping, we go out to meet with friends, but we use our personal responsibility to take care of our own lives.” Former St. Mary’s County Del. Deb Rey, a Republican, addressed the crowd in Kent Island, where many stood around her. “We are out here protecting our First Amendment rights,” she said to cheers. “The First Amendment right we’re out here about is redressing our grievances with government. This is not a protest. This is our way of letting Governor Hogan and his administration know that we are not happy with his decisions to keep us locked down.” Rey, speaking into a megaphone, argued that the stay-at-home order should apply only to those who are infected, saying, “You and I are not sick” to those gathered around. It’s possible for someone to have the coronavirus, be asymptomatic and spread it to others. Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore and parts of Harford, Baltimore and Carroll counties who is a licensed physician specializing in anesthesiology, said he thinks enough is known about the virus now to start ending restrictions. “Let’s let common sense prevail now. We know what’s safe and what isn’t,” Harris said to a cheering crowd of at least several dozen in Salisbury, most of whom did not wear masks and stood closer than 6 feet together. Many wore yellow T-shirts that read “Open Maryland” on the front and “We are all essential. Trust each other” on the back. Other speakers discussed the possibility of legal actions to attempt to overturn restrictions and promised future public events in coming weeks. Baltimore Sun reporters Pamela Wood and Lillian Reed and Capital Gazette reporter Alex Mann contributed to this article.

Give tenants rent reprieve amid coronavirus pandemic, but don’t forget landlords, too | COMMENTARY
.W
Tenant and housing groups around the country have in recent days called for rent strikes and cancellations until the coronavirus-stricken economy recovers. People are wrapping their cars in “rent cancellation” signs and using the mantra in social media hashtags. Last week a rent strike was started where even those who can afford to pay were encouraged to withhold checks in support of those who can’t. We understand and sympathize with the efforts of frustrated tenants scared that they could end up with no place to live. COVID-19 has halted much of the economy, shuttering businesses and leaving millions of people out of work and wondering how they will pay their bills, including what is usually the biggest expense of all — housing. With no end in sight, the pandemic threatens to create a massive homelessness problem down the road if the average Joe is not bailed out like small business and major industries, such as airlines. These tenants need help to prevent future devastation. But simple rent cancellations don’t address the complexity of the issue and would be hard to do anyway because of constitutional issues regarding private banking contracts. Any solution needs to involve both tenants and landlords. You can’t help one without the other. Landlords are often painted with broad brush strokes as greedy business people looking to collect a check with no care for the well-being of their tenants. But managing rental properties is a business, and landlords can only cover the costs of maintaining a property with no rental revenue coming in for so long. (Some can’t afford it now). When tenants don’t pay rent, expenses don’t suddenly disappear. Not to mention, all landlords don’t fit the typical portrayal of large conglomerates with multiple properties that bring in a lot of money. In fact, there are many small landlords with one or two properties. The housing bust of the mid 2000s left many homeowners underwater on their mortgages, and when they couldn’t sell their homes, they turned to the rental business. These landlords need monthly rental payments to pay their mortgages or face foreclosure, which would also lead to tenant evictions, in this case by banks who likely won’t care that a tenant lost a job. There are other expenses as well, such as property taxes, utility bills and basic maintenance. Landlords, like homeowners, can work out payment deferrals with their banks, and the federal government has provided some other protections for certain mortgage holders. But more could be done. Any further reprieve that is granted by the state or local government should make sure both landlords and tenants are made financially sound. Federally, a bill by Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, would provide $100 billion in assistance to renters, landlords and those pushed to homelessness. In Maryland, The ACLU of Maryland, Homeless Persons Representation Project and Public Justice Center recently called on Gov. Larry Hogan to devote $153 million in federal relief money to rental assistance and eviction prevention. The groups also want an extension — from June 1 to July 27 — of the eviction and utility moratorium that the governor issued by executive order at the start of the crisis. Fifty Maryland lawmakers have also called on the governor to cancel rent and mortgage payments in the state for residents and businesses facing financial difficulties because of COVID-19. As companies continue to bleed jobs, the likelihood of families finding themselves in better financial situations in the next month isn’t high, since many were already living paycheck to paycheck before the current crisis. Governor Larry Hogan has no choice but to halt evictions and utility shut-offs for longer than was initially planned as COVID-19 persists. Relief money should also go toward this looming issue — as long as it supports both landlords and tenants who are truly experiencing hardship. We know there are unscrupulous landlords who take advantage of tenants, and we don’t want to see any government aid used as another easy money stream for these businesses. We would urge the governor to continue requiring proof of income loss and hardship as he has with eviction relief. Although some may say that is burdensome, the process needs some accountability, and it is not hard to get proof of a layoff, pay cut or receipt of unemployment benefits. The governor should also close any loopholes that allowed landlords to continue to file for eviction despite the moratorium, as the tenant and housing advocates say has occurred. With hundreds of thousands of Marylanders out of work because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many families are understandably finding it hard to pay rent. The governor’s efforts early actions were a good start, but more needs to be done in the interest of both public health and humanity.

McDaniels and writer Peter Jensen — offers opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers. It is separate from the newsroom.

Baltimore homeless, clustered in large shelters or living in encampments, are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus pandemic
.W
Precautions are being taken from shelters to encampments to prevent a rapid and deadly spread of the new coronavirus among Baltimore’s homeless community. But some say the protections do not go far enough, leaving these vulnerable men, women and children at extreme risk. Often without access to soap and water — or the ability to keep physical distance from one another — people experiencing homelessness, as well as their advocates, fear many in this population will contract the virus, spread it widely and be in greater danger of death given the chronic diseases many already face. City officials, shelter staff and health care providers say they understand the peril and are moving deliberately and expeditiously. Plans are in place to screen the homeless for symptoms, continue distributing hygiene items and create spaces for people to be isolated when necessary, including giving them a hotel room. The mayor’s office said it also has agreements with health care providers to ensure people staying in shelters who display symptoms of the virus can get tested. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young’s office is regularly assessing information and issuing new guidance to shelters and homeless service providers about screening protocols and when to isolate people from a group. Still, 60-year-old Mark Council said given his age, underlying health problems and unstable housing situation, he is “nervous and scared” about becoming ill — or worse. He has been sleeping at his brother’s house near Reisterstown Road and Northern Parkway after spending three or four years staying in shelters, but he continues to rely on providers like Health Care for the Homeless for support. The city needs to move urgently to get homeless families into hotels and affordable, permanent housing to lower the risk for everyone, said Council, a member of the advocacy group Housing Our Neighbors. The group is circulating a letter to the city’s top officials demanding more action and resources on behalf of homeless families, and they point to Baltimore’s budget reserves as a source of money. “The homeless people are people as well,” Council said. “I can’t stress that enough. It is a shame how the city is treating its brothers and sisters.” Jerrianne Anthony, director of the Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services, said city officials are working around the clock to put protections in place for those who are unhoused. Shelter staff will be taking temperatures, moving beds farther apart and making sure people have enough to eat. Shelters also will have access to a special hotline from Health Care for the Homeless for medical advice to assist in screenings. The city is helping to request supplies, such as face masks, for providers through the command center. Anthony said officials have ordered mobile hand-washing stations, though while they wait for them, officials have dropped off soap, gallons of water, paper towels and hand sanitizer at large encampments. Additionally, the mayor’s office is working to build capacity for organizations that serve the homeless to provide more locations so people can stay farther apart. More space also is needed to offer isolated shelter for those believed to be infected while they await test results or recover after testing positive. That could include the use of hotel rooms, although officials could not say how many would be available. “We’re attacking this at all angles,” Anthony said. “We want to be able to quickly assess, test and isolate those who may test positive and exercise social distancing to prevent the spread." Kevin Lindamood, who runs Health Care for the Homeless, said the organization has been facing a shortage of supplies and stopped offering dental services to divert face masks to other health care services. Continuing their services during the pandemic is vital, so people can manage their health and treat any chronic illnesses, Lindamood said. And so, he said, Health Care for the Homeless and other service providers are appealing to city and state leaders to put as many resources as possible behind serving such vulnerable populations. “We work every day with medically frail people who live their private lives in public spaces,” Lindamood said. "People who sleep alongside 300 others in congregate facilities. People who sleep on benches at BWI. We must stop the spread of the virus to this population. They are members of our community and their risk is our risk.” At Health Care for the Homeless clinics, Lindamood said everyone — staff, clients and visitors — are being screened before entering the facilities. The screenings involve asking questions about exposure and taking temperatures. Lindamood said his team has not come up with a single positive screening, which suggests the virus is not widespread among Baltimore’s homeless population at this point. And when cases appear, he said, the goal is to slow the spread as much as possible. “For people living in congregant facilities, viruses like this can spread like wildfires,” he said. At one of the city’s biggest shelters, the Weinberg Housing and Resource Center run by Catholic Charities on Fallsway, admissions remain open for people experiencing homelessness after they have been screened, said Christine Collins, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit. The shelter also has identified isolated spaces on site for people who display symptoms. The practices and precautions are similar at other shelters in the region. The Westside Emergency Men’s Shelter in Baltimore County is performing temperature screening for anyone who enters the entire Spring Grove campus, said Megan Goffney, deputy director of Community Assistance Network, which runs a number of shelters in the county. “If anyone receives a fever temperature they will need to be checked out further," Goffney wrote in an email. Some say they are encouraged by the plans as they have been evolving. Antonia Fasanelli, who runs the Homeless Persons Representation Project, said the city has taken some promising steps so far, including pledging to provide hotel rooms and halt evictions. Advocates remain concerned, however, about access to food stamps and other benefits, Fasanelli said. Her team is working with case managers across service providers to determine what legal needs people have, including whether they can access to public assistance or are illegally locked out of their home. The state Department of Human Services said it is taking steps to relax requirements for ongoing public benefit cases, so that staff will be available to process new applications and keep benefits flowing. While social services offices are closed now, the agency is taking applications and offering information online and over the phone. Officials also are working with outreach partners to reach homeless families in encampments and elsewhere. “Our goal is to ensure our customers are able to meet their basic needs with the least amount of hardship,” said Katherine Morris, a human services spokeswoman. City Councilman Zeke Cohen said he helped dropped off supplies and food at some encampments — while trying to keep safe physical distances and spread the word about how the people there could best protect themselves. “I am deeply concerned,” he said, adding that rehousing people is the ultimate goal. “Unfortunately, there isn’t a quick solution," Cohen said. “We are going to have to be really creative in trying to figure out housing opportunities that are nontraditional for our neighbors experiencing homelessness." Brandon Berryain was homeless for years. Now living in an apartment in Cherry Hill, the 63-year-old man said he is hunkered down inside, with his freezer stocked with stews and goulash. Having the security of a house, where he can safely care for himself and manage his diabetes and high blood pressure, gives him the comfort and peace of mind he wishes for others. “I am lying back and chilling, reading some, staying away from folks,” Berryain said. At any one time, more than 7,000 people are homeless in Maryland, including some 2,500 in Baltimore.

Maryland’s U.S. senators say coronavirus makes it ‘urgent’ to allow more federal employees to work remotely
.W
Maryland’s U.S. senators on Wednesday stepped up their efforts to allow more federal employees to work remotely, saying the new coronavirus has made the need for telework “particularly urgent.” Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin have long been asking the Trump administration to expand telecommuting opportunities for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, saying remote work increases productivity and boosts employee morale,. On Wednesday, the two Democrats introduced a bill to expand teleworking by requiring federal agencies to set goals for employee participation, report subsequent cost savings, and notify Congress of any plans to restrict working at home. The coronavirus outbreak provides new impetus for their efforts, the lawmakers said. “It obviously makes sense to have a robust telework plan in place both for ongoing operations, but especially during this health crisis,” Van Hollen said. “When you see a situation like this, it underscores the importance of having that option available.” U.S. Rep. John Sarbanes, a Baltimore County Democrat, has introduced a companion measure on the House side. Maryland has one of the largest federal workforces in the country, with more than 128,000 federal workers based in the state, according to government data. In December, Van Hollen and Cardin were among lawmakers urging Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul to reconsider his cancellation of a telework pilot program that let people work from home once or twice a week. Social Security employs roughly 11,000 people in Maryland, many of them at the agency’s headquarters in Woodlawn. Social Security officials say they made the move to make customer service more timely and accurate. In an “open letter to the public," Saul said the agency must dramatically improve on that front, citing wait times and other issues. Across many federal government agencies, the Trump administration had been scaling back working remotely on grounds that it made employees less accountable. After canceling the telework pilot, Social Security announced it would further scale back telework. Those changes took effect March 2. “It’s coming right in the middle of coronavirus,” said Ralph de Juliis, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 220, which represents Social Security workers in telecommunication centers and field offices across the nation. Morale already took a hit with the telework changes, De Juliis said, but now with U.S. coronavirus cases growing, “everyone is anxious.” Before that, the federal government largely encouraged telecommuting. The 2010 Telework Enhancement Act required agencies to write policies on working from home. In recent days, the Trump administration has been developing new workplace plans to cope with the virus. In a memorandum last Saturday, the Office of Personnel Management requested that agencies “immediately review their current telework policies and ensure that written telework agreements are in place for as many employees as possible.” OPM said agencies should reassess their criteria for telework eligibility “to determine if additional categories of employees may be classified as telework eligible.”

Laurel Medical Center to reopen by late April to treat coronavirus patients, part of hospital surge plan
.W
The University of Maryland Medical System is expected to reopen its Laurel hospital and start treating patients the last week of April to help prepare for the expected increase of coronavirus cases in Maryland, officials said Thursday. The University of Maryland Capital Region Health said the 135-bed expansion will help treat patients who are believed to be infected with COVID-19 or have tested positive for the virus. The hospital expansion comes after Gov. Larry Hogan called for a surge capacity of 6,000 more beds in the state. Currently, there are about four dozen acute care hospitals in the state with about 7,400 beds for adults available, which don’t including the psychiatric beds, labor and delivery beds and some others. The Laurel hospital is one of two sites outside of the existing hospitals; the other is the Baltimore Convention Center, where there will be about 250 beds. The former Laurel Regional Hospital had been converted into an outpatient medical center after being acquired by the University of Maryland Medical System in 2017. The Laurel Medical Center will be staffed by nearly 400 contracted health care workers, in addition to UMMS existing staff, officials said. Coronavirus models show the potential peak for cases in Maryland could come between mid to late April. "We are proud to be the principal team activating this monumental surge response at UM Laurel Medical Center,” said Joseph Wright, president and interim CEO of UM Capital Region Health. "The dogged commitment and execution by the project management team is a testament to the inherent professionalism on display across the system as we respond to this unprecedented crisis” The UM Laurel Medical Center expansion will be managed and overseen by UMMS and UM Capital Region Health leadership. No visitors will be allowed to see patients at the facility, following the same policy other UMMS hospitals have implemented. Community testing for coronavirus will not be conducted at the facility, officials said, and nobody will be able to walk up to the hospital, unless they were admitted through the emergency department, officials said. “We are beyond appreciative for the dedication and resilience of our employees during this COVID-19 pandemic,” said Min Godwin, COO of UM Capital Region Health. “It is their sacrifices and putting the needs of our community and our patients first that is getting us though this pandemic."

Orioles sent home in MLB reversal after teams initially asked players to stay through coronavirus shutdown
.W
A day into the shutdown of spring training and delay of the Major League Baseball season caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the fluid nature of how the Orioles and the rest of the league will prepare for their eventual season was on full display. Orioles executive vice president/general manager Mike Elias held a conference call at noon to outline the team’s plan, stressing they were operating on a day-to-day basis but that a full cleaning of their closed major league and minor league complexes Friday would be followed by players returning to camp, as was the team’s preference. The Orioles, he said at the time, were “very intent on keeping everyone here until told otherwise.” That was the guidance from the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association as well. But a league-wide call a few hours later changed that and both major league and minor league players were sent home by teams, which seems to signal that the two-week delay in the regular season beginning might extend beyond that. In a fast-moving situation, Elias and the Orioles’ plans were changed from above, leaving only the reality that it’s unclear whether a two-week delay in start of the regular season was all that was in store. “We can only start playing baseball when we can start playing baseball, and there’s only so much that we can control," Elias said on the conference call. “I think so much of our economy and society is being disrupted by this, and none of it is ideal, and we’ve just got to deal with it.” Elias said no one in the organization has been tested for COVID-19, nor has anyone presented symptoms. He also praised how prepared and nimble the organization had been “very proactive on making sure that we have the right approach, the right protocols, with the health and safety of our players and the staff members and the community around our camp being the main priority right now.” But a more widely held understanding of the scope of the pandemic meant baseball had to address things quickly, and the league reversed course on its orders from the previous day for players to stay where they are. The machinations that went into the first day of the shutdown mirrored the uncertainty that met the previous day, especially for the Orioles. The Orioles were on the bus leaving for a spring training game Thursday afternoon only to drive around the block and come back to the Ed Smith Stadium complex because of the uncertainty over a shutdown that eventually was imposed a few hours later. “This has happened really fast for everybody,” Elias said on the call. “Just yesterday, we were loading up on a bus to go to Fort Myers, and all of a sudden, we weren’t.” Union player representative Chris Davis said Thursday there was a lot of uncertainty about the plans for players, who have already been at camp for at least a month and were staring down the possibility of at least another month there, complicating family, schooling and housing plans. The Orioles’ complexes will be partially staffed and operational for players who either need or want to stay, but otherwise, the 54 players in major league camp and the approximately 150 players at minor league camp at Twin Lakes Park will disperse. Presumably, the players will need to return for an abbreviated spring training to re-start preparations for the season. Sending them home after the league so strongly wanted to keep them where they were to prevent unnecessary travel suggests that may not be soon. With amateur baseball also affected, Elias said the team’s scout travel “has dramatically slowed and been reduced,” simply by a lack of games to go to, and MLB was monitoring that situation to determine if the June draft should be changed. There was still no word from MLB as to what the change in Opening Day means for date-based contract language, or if or when the Orioles can send players out of major league camp, Elias said. In the early afternoon, he could only work with what information the league had given the teams. But most of it came with an understanding that the delayed Opening Day, originally set for March 26 at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, would now be no earlier than April 9. “I think we are all poised for the possibility of changes to that,” Elias said.

Baltimore County man in his 60s is Maryland’s second coronavirus death
.W
A second Maryland resident who tested positive for coronavirus has died, Gov. Larry Hogan reported Friday night. The victim was a Baltimore County man in his 60s with underlying medical conditions, the governor said. Neither the man’s identity nor his area of residence in the county was disclosed. “On behalf of our entire state, we send our heartfelt condolences to his family and to all those who loved him,” Hogan said in a statement. “This sad passing is a stark reminder of the seriousness of the crisis we face,” said Baltimore County Executive John Olszewski, “and it breaks my heart to know that this will not be the last life we lose to this pandemic.” It was the state’s second death from the virus in three days. On Wednesday night, Hogan reported the state’s first death in the pandemic, a man in his 60s from Prince George’s County. Officials said the man had acquired the disease through community transmission. He, too, had underlying health problems, officials said. As of Friday afternoon, Maryland had 149 confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to Kata Hall, spokeswoman for the governor. That was up from 107 cases on Thursday.

'Technical challenges’: Maryland officials struggle to comply with open meetings law amid coronavirus restrictions
.W
As the Maryland State Board of Education began its much-anticipated March meeting, it was clear there was a problem: People couldn’t hear. Teachers and parents were tuning in from across the state, eager to glean information about school closures amid the state’s sweeping measures to contain the coronavirus. But the audio stream was patchy for some, unworkable for others. As complaints poured in, board members called a halt to the meeting. They consulted an attorney, who said they couldn’t hold the meeting if it wasn’t public. The company providing the livestream added bandwidth, and the meeting resumed. About 20 minutes later, the system crashed again. David Steiner, a board member from Baltimore, said the board was told the disruption last week was caused by the “unexpectedly large volume" of people joining in, which overwhelmed the system. It was frustrating, he said, but something the board is committed to fixing. “We are all adjusting to the situation, and systems built for normal times are put under stress,” Steiner said. “They’ve been working with the IT folks to try to make sure this doesn’t happen again, because our first responsibility in a public meeting is that it be public, to ensure that everyone can hear and follow along." Across Maryland, government bodies large and small are contending with similar issues. In a state where the law mandates public access to most government meetings, at a time when the governor has banned gatherings of more than 10 people to halt the viral threat, school boards and spending panels and city councils that must go on governing are increasingly turning to technology to provide access through virtual links and livestreams. They are doing so with varying degrees of success, as even bodies that have streamed their meetings for years struggle with the greater challenge of board members themselves working remotely and how to allow for public input, particularly in cases when there is no actual face-to-face meeting. The Maryland Board of Public Works, which controls state spending, met last week via a video hookup — the first time such a meeting was conducted “in a virtual environment,” said Republican Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, who chaired the meeting for Gov. Larry Hogan as Hogan focused on the virus response. “As I said to the treasurer a little earlier, we are in the future now,” Rutherford said. At the meeting’s end, Democratic Comptroller Peter Franchot said: “I don’t mean to sound surprised, but I’m stunned that it actually worked.” The Board of Regents for the University System of Maryland, which oversees the state’s public universities, didn’t have the same success when it met March 19 by teleconference to announce its universities and colleges would be closed for the rest of the semester. More than 100 people joined the call, causing a din of background noise. Everyone was repeatedly asked to mute their devices, but it didn’t work, to the point where it was difficult to hear what Chancellor Jay Perman was saying. After repeated requests for people to mute their phones, the call was ended and everyone was asked to dial back in. But the background chatter continued. Mike Lurie, a spokesman for the board, said it has “worked hard to meet the logistical challenges associated with maintaining open communication while, at the same time, facilitating rapid decision-making” in response to the pandemic, including by having call-in teleconferences. “This is obviously a fast-moving and fluid situation and many organizations and businesses are dealing with technical challenges involved in a telework environment,” Lurie said. “The USM is not immune to these challenges and has used them to improve its public outreach and transparency.” Joanne Antoine, executive director of Common Cause Maryland, said the issue has been cropping up more and more in recent days, making it more important to highlight it and get it fixed. She said her group, which conducted internal meetings on the Zoom video conferencing app, understands the pandemic and the measures to stop it have “created challenges that a lot of these bodies just were not ready for,” but that is not an excuse for cutting the public out of government actions. “The public confidence in the government is crucial right now, and decisions being made without the public being able to observe and participate really just isn’t the best decision,” Antoine said. She said her group recommends government bodies start “limiting the work that’s being conducted to just emergency or priority government action," provide the public clear information about how to virtually participate in meetings, and immediately halt any proceedings if audio or video streams cut out or become otherwise unreliable. Democratic Attorney General Brian Frosh’s office, which agencies have turned to for guidance, has supported teleconferences and other technologies for maintaining as much access as possible to any public meetings. “The overriding principle is that when a public body encounters circumstances that challenge its ability to admit the public to an open meeting in the usual location, the public body must provide the public with the best possible opportunity to observe the conduct of public business, given those circumstances,” Frosh’s guidance said. Michael Greenberger, director of the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland School of Law and an expert on executive powers during emergencies, said under state law, Hogan’s orders pursuant to his emergency declaration could take precedence over the open meetings law, particularly if the law was determined to be undermining the emergency orders. But for now, that’s a moot point, because government bodies across the state seem to be showing “a good faith effort” to comport with both the law and Hogan’s orders, he said. “Everybody is trying to do their best.” Before the Maryland General Assembly ended its session early earlier this month, it rushed to pass more than 650 bills in an unusual environment at the State House. To limit the spread of the disease, Senate President Bill Ferguson and House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, both Democrats, barred all but lawmakers, key staffers and credentialed media. Committees voted on key legislation in rooms full of empty chairs. The lobbyists, advocates and members of the public who typically attend sessions of the House and Senate were forced to watch or listen online. But several times, audio and visual feeds of the chambers’ proceedings cut out. Lawmakers would wave their arms or hold up computer screens showing the streams weren’t functioning. The Senate’s audio stream cut out so frequently that Ferguson began streaming the chamber on Facebook Live. In Baltimore, City Council President Brandon Scott oversaw the first virtual Board of Estimates meeting Wednesday. Top city officials appeared via video conference from various locations across City Hall to approve a lengthy agenda But with no way to allow for public debate, and no mechanism to hear a protest from the ACLU of Maryland, the board deferred by a week a scheduled vote on a controversial agreement to fly three aerial surveillance planes above Baltimore. “Something of that significance has to have public discussion, which we know takes on a different meaning" during the pandemic, Scott said. An array of other city meetings have been canceled — including a pesticide control hearing, a monthly police oversight meeting, a discussion on Baltimore’s zero waste efforts and more than two dozen other council hearings scheduled for the latter half of March. Scott said his office is working as fast as it can to find new, 21st-century solutions to the needs of the community and of city government at a time when physical gatherings are verboten. “We want to make sure that the citizens of Baltimore, the average citizens, can have the access that they need,” he said. “I will not have things that the public cannot be involved in." In some ways, the crisis is forcing the city to do what it always should have been doing, he said: meeting people “where they are.” Baltimore Sun reporters Jeff Barker, Luke Broadwater and Talia Richman contributed to this article.

Here’s how health officials trace disease transmission — and why it could be no match for the coronavirus outbreak
.W
When Maryland health officials confirmed the state’s first positive tests for the novel coronavirus last week, tied to a cruise on Egypt’s Nile River, they quickly found half a dozen other residents who recently stayed aboard the same ship. Within days, it turned up at least two more cases of COVID-19. The practice known as contact tracing is key in early stages of an epidemic, a trusted public health strategy to contain the spread of any pathogen. In places like Baltimore and Howard County, where no cases have been confirmed yet, health officials say they are ready to investigate exposure to any infection that does arise. But public health experts say it may be too late — and undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 too numerous — for coronavirus transmission to be tracked. “This is an absolutely key containment strategy,” said Dr. Gabor Kelen, a professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins University. “We’re sort of on the cusp, and maybe have already moved away from containment to mitigation.” Maryland has so far reported only a single case of what is known as “community transmission,” when the disease is passed among people with no known exposure through travel or a person known to be infected. It did not disclose any details about the six new cases confirmed Friday aside from their counties. But with urgent measures announced Thursday, including closure of public schools for weeks, officials acknowledged the coronavirus is spreading faster than it can be tracked. Ohio officials, for example, said Thursday they estimated there could be 100,000 cases of COVID-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus, within that state — even though there are only a handful of confirmed cases there. With communicable diseases that are required to be reported to public health officials, any positive test triggers an investigation into possible exposure. Health officials ask the person when their symptoms started to determine when they may have become infectious to others, said Dr. Adena Greenbaum, assistant commissioner for clinical services for the Baltimore City Health Department. And then they ask the patient to trace their movement and contacts with as much detail as possible — sometimes using bank or credit card records and phone and text message histories. Officials ask the patients for names and contact information for anyone they know they’ve had contact with, and health departments often seek assistance from other authorities to help track the contacts down, Greenbaum said. When officials reach those people, they typically don’t share the identity of the infected person, and always seek to balance public risk with patient privacy, she said. But in extreme situations, Kelen said, there can be greater latitude on privacy issues. In hospitals, similar reviews occur when infectious patients arrive, said Dr. Faheem Younus, chief of infectious diseases at University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. To estimate exposure risk, anyone in contact with a patient must be interviewed about exactly how close they got and what protective equipment they were wearing. Dr. Jacqueline Douge, medical director in the Howard County Health Department’s health services bureau, said it’s hard to say the extent to which contact tracing could be conducted if and when any COVID-19 cases arise in the county. Scientists and health officials are still learning and sharing lessons about how contagious COVID-19 patients are, and when. “I think that’s evolving,” Douge said. “There are going to be a lot of factors determining the extent of contact tracing.” With sexually transmitted infections, for example, contacts can be easier to track. But with diseases such as the measles, risk to the community can be significantly harder to track. For example, amid a measles outbreak last year, health officials could not determine everyone who visited a Baltimore grocery store where an infected person shopped, so they had to issue a broad public warning, Greenbaum said. With the novel coronavirus, contact tracing could be effective at containment, if it’s started early, Younus said. As with so many other aspects of medicine, “it’s a race against time,” he said. Maryland health officials did not respond this week to questions about the resources the state is putting toward contact tracing. Typically, health departments have core staff focused on contact tracing for communicable diseases, but can pull in other staff to assist in the efforts during an emergency. Doctors said there is a limited window during which those resources can be effective, though. “The farther this goes, there just isn’t going to be the manpower for contact tracing," Kelen said. “Whatever they have, it’s not enough.”

Department stores join specialty stores in temporary closures as coronavirus spreads
.W
Department stores Boscov’s, Macy’s and Nordstrom, all of which have stores in the Baltimore region, joined a growing list of national specialty stores in shutting their doors to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Boscov’s said Wednesday it will close all 49 stores for the rest of the month “for everyone’s safety.” “We are doing this because we believe it is the most effective way to stop the spread of COVID-19, and we urge all business and individuals to follow the best advice of the medical community and be part of the solution,” said Jim Boscov, the Pennsylvania-based retailer’s chairman and CEO, in a letter to customers. “This pandemic will challenge us all. Difficult decisions have been made, but I’m confident... we will successfully navigate this crisis." Also on Wednesday, jewelry maker Pandora said it would close its U.S. stores for two weeks and encouraged its franchisees to do the same. Pandora, based in Denmark but with its U.S. headquarters in Baltimore, said its manufacturing plants in Thailand have not been affected. Dick’s Sporting Goods reversed course from previous plans to stay open and said Wednesday it too would temporarily close all stores, until April 2, while offering curbside pickup and paying employees. Hanover-based DTLR Villa announced a temporary chainwide shutdown Tuesday, while Baltimore-based Under Armour and Nike had made similar announcements over the weekend. More than 60 U.S. retailers have reportedly made decisions in recent days to voluntarily close stores, joining schools, universities, restaurants and an array of public places as Americans are urged to stay home if possible. Most retailers are hoping consumers will buy online instead and directed shoppers to their websites. The “health and safety of our employees and customers is our top priority," said DTLR Villa CEO Glenn Gaynor and co-CEO Scott Collins in a statement as the clothing and shoe retailer said it would close all stores and its corporate office through March 31. Macy’s is closing its 775 stores, which include Bloomingdale’s, also through March 31 and said it will offer compensation and benefits to its workers. “We will work with government and health officials to assess when we will reopen our stores and safely bring our colleagues back to work,” said Jeff Gennette, chairman and CEO of New York-based Macy’s. Nordstrom said Monday that it hoped to do its part to limit the spread of the virus by closing Nordstrom full-line, Nordstrom Rack and other brands in the U.S. and Canada for two weeks starting Tuesday and providing pay and benefits for employees. Nordstrom, which operates 380 stores in 40 states, said its online business accounted for a third of sales last year. “During this unprecedented period of uncertainty, we have in place the appropriate business continuity plans, operational framework and team,” CEO Erik Nordstrom said. “This, in concert with ending 2019 with a solid financial position and healthy balance sheet, gives us the ability to weather this challenging moment in time.” Under Armour closed all 188 of its North American stores Monday, through March 28, and said it would continue to pay its store employees. “We are monitoring the situation globally, and closure decisions are being made on a country-by-country basis as necessary to protect our teammates and customers,” Tara M. Moore, Under Armour’s director of global communications, said in a statement Sunday. The Baltimore-based athletic apparel brand added that it will continue to observe work-from-home and flexible attendance policies while stepping up sanitary measures in its corporate offices and distribution centers in the Baltimore region and around the world. Nike, Apple and Lululemon also had announced closures. Apple closed all stores outside China until further notice. Other specialty and mall-based stores that have announced temporary closures include Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Anthropologie, Bath & Body Works, Chico’s, Disney Store, DSW and Foot Locker. PVH Corp., the parent company of Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, Izod and Speedo, will close all stores in North America and Europe through March 29. Many of the company-operated stores across the Asia Pacific region have reopened, the company said in an announcement. Arhaus, a furniture and decor retailer, said Wednesday it will close stores starting Thursday but would have design teams are available for video and phone consultations private viewings by appointment at select stores.

'It’s like nothing else’: Sen. Amy Klobuchar and her husband, a Baltimore law professor, discuss his coronavirus recovery
.W
John Bessler, a University of Baltimore law professor, and his wife, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar,  spoke in a TV interview Tuesday night with NBC Nightly News  after his battle with the coronavirus that landed him in the hospital. Bessler, 52, tested positive March 23 but told NBC correspondent Stephanie Gosk that he started feeling sick the morning of March 12. The day before he fell ill, he told NBC, he taught three classes and then it “just suddenly hit me and I had a fever, and that fever just lasted for days and days." It took six days for Bessler to receive his positive coronavirus test results. Klobuchar said to NBC that she did not get tested because she had been away from her husband for two weeks, putting her outside the 14-day window for contracting the virus. Bessler started teaching at the University of Baltimore’s law school in 2009, a few years after his wife was elected to her first term in the Senate in 2006. He also advised Klobuchar during her unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination during the past year. Klobuchar told NBC she was in Washington, D.C., working on the coronavirus stimulus package and stayed in a different location from her husband, who self-quarantined. The senator said she called her husband every few hours to help keep track of his temperature. Bessler told NBC, he drove to the emergency room after he threw up blood. Bessler said he called ahead and “they actually brought me in through a door in the kind of a garage area, so I wouldn’t have to be in the main waiting area.” X-rays showed Bessler had developed pneumonia, which is a known complication of COVID-19, and tests showed he had low oxygen, according to NBC. As her husband was in the hospital, Klobuchar was on Capitol Hill helping negotiate the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill. “I keep telling my colleagues this is really serious,” said Klobuchar, who dropped out the presidential race last month. “When this happens in your family or to your friends, it’s like nothing else.” The senator said she called the hospital to receive updates on her husband as often as she could, and said she is thankful he ended up healthy. Klobachar said she “can’t even imagine those families where they hear the opposite news.” “There are people where it turns for the worse, and they’re on ventilators, or they don’t make it, and it’s a heartbreaking thing, and it’s why we have to invest in testing and do everything to make up for the mistakes that were made at the beginning, where a country was not prepared for this," Klobachar said. Bessler urged people to follow government guidelines and pay attention to COVID-19 because it can “happen to anybody.” There are 4,371 total confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Maryland and more than 100 deaths. There are almost 400,000 positive cases across the United States and nearly 13,000 deaths.

Baltimore County suspends evictions, prohibits gatherings of more than 50 in coronavirus response
.W
Gatherings of 50 people or more in Baltimore County will be prohibited beginning Wednesday and all evictions in the county are suspended for as long as the county is under a state of emergency because of the novel coronavirus, Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski announced Monday. “This situation continues to evolve rapidly and we remain committed to taking whatever action necessary to promote social distancing, limit the spread of COVID-19, and save lives,” Olszewski said in a statement. Effective Wednesday, local law enforcement officials will be empowered to break up large gatherings of more than 50 people at all venues in the county, and officials also have the authority to further reduce the number. County Sheriff R. Jay Fisher has suspended all evictions in the county for as long as the state of emergency is in effect. Additionally, all county licenses, permits and registrations will be extended until 30 days after the local state of emergency is lifted, and public access to government buildings will be screened and limited. All “non-essential” public meetings are postponed or canceled, and members of the general public will be prohibited from attending any emergency or essential meetings in order to encourage social distancing. Instructions on how the public can still observe and participate in such meetings will be provided on a case-by-case basis, the county said. Already, the county had announced measures to encourage social distancing and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, including teleworking for all non-essential county employees, closing recreation and senior centers, closing libraries, and halting water shutoffs.

Fears, face masks and frugality: Adjusting to life in the midst of coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
We all have to adjust to what life throws at us — a bit of bad luck, a surprising twist in an important relationship, a new boss at work, maybe a health problem that demands a change of lifestyle. All of us face the unexpected at some point, and all but the stubborn and clueless find a way to adjust. But not like this. Not all at one time. It’s already a cliche to say we’ve never been here before, but we’ve never been here before. Never in modern memory have so many Americans, and people around the world, had to make such radical changes in behavior, and this to avoid getting sick or spreading a deadly disease. The coronavirus brings us to a whole new level of strange and unsettling, requiring adjustments major and minor. On the major side — sudden unemployment for millions of Americans. We’ve seen it before, but not like this. Mass unemployment was the stuff of the Dust Bowl and Depression, not something economists were predicting any time soon for the world’s biggest economy. The national unemployment rate for February was 3.5%, for Maryland 3.3%. Last week, more than 6.6 million Americans filed jobless claims, some 84,000 of them in Maryland. That’s a seismic change. Losing your job through no fault of your own is traumatic, and we’re all familiar with the most common reasons: Your company downsized its workforce in a recession or it might have moved operations to another country or it decided to replace you with a robot. This time, it was a virus. This time, people who had the same job for years are among those who find themselves idled. It might have made more sense for the U.S. Treasury to subsidize companies to keep people on payrolls for a few months instead of boosting unemployment benefits and burdening state governments with a huge surge of claims. But that’s not the way we do things — Congress isn’t very good at making such adjustments — so we have a conventional approach to helping the unemployed, but at least on a more generous scale. The enhanced benefits will help. Still, millions will live with double uncertainty for the next few months — uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and uncertainty about whether their jobs will be there on the other side. Another adjustment: Living with inevitably bad news. The predictions for the misery caused by the coronavirus have been breathtakingly grim, and the reality is right there beside it. Not since the country was at war — Vietnam, and later Iraq and Afghanistan — have we heard casualty counts in the hundreds and thousands. But even then, the numbers were not always readily or prominently reported. And the loss of life, of course, was mainly military and overseas. Here we are, with coronavirus spreading through the civilian population, hitting everyone from children to grandparents. The attacks of 9/11 made all of us feel vulnerable, but not like this. This time we’ve had to adjust to fear of something we cannot see. And what do we do about that? We live with it. We try to be smart. We listen to leadership — the public health professionals and the governor — and do the right thing: We stay home and, if still employed, work from there if we can. We wash our hands. We keep our distance. We go to the supermarket once a week, instead of twice or three times. We adjust our egos so that we’re not offended when another shopper sees us, drops her eyes and takes two steps back. We understand if the supermarket workers aren’t as smiley as they were a few weeks ago. We see people wearing gloves and masks and accept it as normal. Maybe, out of worry or common sense, you make personal adjustments. You’re probably more frugal, more discerning about the food you buy. You don’t gripe when there are only 10 kinds of cereal to choose from rather than 50. Maybe you don’t buy as much meat as you once did. You might still get carryout from restaurants with curbside pickup, but you’re probably doing more cooking and being conscious of wasting food. Spring is here. Maybe you’re thinking about growing some vegetables in a garden or in a few pots in the backyard. You do these things, or think about them, because you don’t want to feel completely helpless. You nurture a little optimism. You steel yourself to living better within the confines of your home. Exercise more. Spend time in the books you’ve been meaning to read. Pull out board games that have been stacked in a closet for months and play with your significant other or your kids. Maybe you use the time to connect with old friends you’ve been meaning to call since you graduated from high school. Maybe you sit down with some stationery and write letters to relatives. If you haven’t written a letter in long-hand since the mid-1990s, don’t worry. It’s just like riding a bicycle, except with a pen. There’s a primary election in a couple of months, and we’re going to be asked to vote by mail. We can do that, too. We can adjust. We might even like some of these adjustments so much that we keep them after the current misery ends.

Calvert Hall golf coach Drew Forrester holds Zoom quiz for team during coronavirus outbreak
.W
Families, friends and co-workers have gathered on videoconferencing system Zoom to create memories with one another during the lockdown from the coronavirus pandemic. Calvert Hall’s golf team put its own spin on a Wednesday night Zoom call, with coach Drew Forrester and assistant coach Brian Hubbard administering a quiz. The 10 members of the varsity squad were split into teams of two. The Masters would have been played April 9-12, and Forrester held the quiz for a fun evening with his team. Eventually, sophomores Lorenzo Sanz and Jack Langford came away victorious with the answer to this question: Who was the winner of the 1994 Masters? It was Spaniard José María Olazábal. Before holding the quiz on Zoom, Forrester texted his entire roster to brush up on their Masters history — from 1986 to 2019 — without context to keep them on their toes. The tournament, usually held each April, just so happens to be Forrester’s favorite of the golf season. “The Masters is by far my favorite tournament of the year and I’m always impressing upon my guys that you have to know golf history,” Forrester said. “I’m a little bit of a golf history junkie. So, it kind of bleeds over — for better or for worse. I just wanted them to know something about The Masters. If we would’ve been in-season, we would’ve been playing this week. “I would’ve definitely done this with them and we would’ve had a ‘Pick the Winner’ contest. I always do something around The Masters and I just thought over the weekend, I really need to get something put together and have a good evening with those guys even though it’s over the internet.” During the preseason, Forrester rallied his team to work out and keep their minds sharp. Much of February and early March brought favorable weather and an opportunity to practice for two to three days of week. In its first match, Calvert Hall won 18-3 against St. John’s (D.C.). While the team was on the sixth hole, the bad news struck. Unfortunately for Forrester and his team, both their golf season and The Masters were postponed. On March 12, Gov. Larry Hogan announced at a news conference that schools would be closed for at least two weeks and on top of it all, the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association suspended all spring sporting events. Golf courses were also closes as part of the shutdown. “It felt like you lost your last match of the year and the season just ended,” Forrester said. “It felt like that — it felt like today we have a season and tomorrow, we can’t practice, we can’t get together. So, it definitely felt weird. We held out hope that after those first two weeks, we would get back in. Now, obviously, we don’t know what’s going on.” Forrester is often a guest on Glenn Clark Radio for PressBox, where the two are quizzed by producer Kyle Ottenheimer. Usually, the quizzes are for enjoyment, just as the one that he gave his team, and he was glad to be the one on the giving instead of receiving end. “Well, the good news in this one is that the odds weren’t stacked against me, whenever I do it with Glenn,” Forrester said while laughing. “But it was cool because I gave them the questions and knew all of the answers. It was neat to see the camaraderie — that’s the one thing that I think we really had on our team — we had a good culture. “We have a lot of kids that like each other on the course and off of the course. So, that warmed my heart — hearing them laugh again and missed being around them.”

New coronavirus case at Stella Maris is ‘unrelated’ to four patients brought to Maryland from Pennsylvania, nursing home says
.W
A resident at Stella Maris tested positive for the coronavirus Thursday and has been placed in isolation, the nursing home said, stressing that the new case was not related to the four patients who were transferred to the long-term care facility’s new COVID-19 unit this week. “Stella Maris believes this case is unrelated to recent admissions of other COVID-19 residents,” spokeswoman Rose Maria Kendig said Thursday. “The other COVID-19 residents were admitted directly into an isolated unit which is separated from the rest of the building. That unit is equipped with a separate exhaust filtration system and has a dedicated staff of healthcare professionals.” The Timonium facility — one of more than 130 in Maryland with residents who have tested positive for the virus causing the global pandemic — did not notify the Baltimore County Health Department before bringing four coronavirus patients to the nursing home’s new unit, County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. said in a statement Thursday. Olszewski, a Democrat, said the lack of communication “raises concerns.” “Baltimore County’s Health Department was not consulted about the decision to transport the patients and was notified after this occurred," he said in the statement. "Our team is now in contact with the Maryland Department of Health and the facility to ensure precautions are being taken and that appropriate public health protocols and control measures are being followed.” Stella Maris has been authorized by the state to provide overflow capacity for overcrowded hospitals with up to 39 additional beds in a pair of COVID-19 units separated from its main nursing home, according to a Certificate of Need issued by the Maryland Health Care Commission last week. Kendig did not immediately respond to Olszewski’s claims. The four patients are Jesuit priests who were transferred from an infirmary in the Philadelphia area, according to news reports. The Pennsylvania State Health Department notified its counterpart agency in Maryland when it received the positive COVID-19 results, said Fran Phillips, Maryland’s deputy health secretary. Maryland health experts then contacted Stella Maris and “walked them through what they were already doing with those individuals with regard to infection control, isolation and all the provisions they needed to make in order to make sure that the rest of the residents were safe at that time," Phillips said in a news conference at the State House in Annapolis Thursday. Phillips said she couldn’t answer whether it was a good idea to bring coronavirus patients to the nursing home in Maryland from another state. "What I can answer is that we found out about that and we acted on it,' she said. “We contacted the facility right away to assure they were abiding with all of the infection control practices.” Baltimore Sun reporters Pamela Wood and Wilborn Nobles III contributed to this article.

Howard schools expand free meals program and add more sites as closures continue amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
With the extended state-mandated public school closure, the Howard County Public School System is ramping up its free meals program, now providing food items at 13 sites across the county. Beginning Monday, the school system will add three new meal distribution sites, a daily snack and, starting April 3, children will receive weekend meals, according to a Thursday news release. State schools Superintendent Karen Salmon announced Wednesday that the statewide public school closure would continue through April 24, a result of the coronavirus pandemic. County meal sites Howard High School, 8700 Old Annapolis Road, Ellicott City  Oakland Mills Middle School, 9540 Kilimanjaro Road, Columbia  Swansfield Elementary School, 5610 Cedar Lane, Columbia  Cradlerock Elementary School/Lake Elkhorn Middle School, 6680 Cradlerock Way, Columbia  Talbott Springs Elementary School, 9550 Basket Ring Road, Columbia  Wilde Lake Middle School, 10481 Cross Fox Lane, Columbia  Laurel Woods Elementary School, 9250 North Laurel Road, Laurel  Deep Run Elementary School, 6925 Old Waterloo Road, Elkridge  Ducketts Lane Elementary School, 6501 Ducketts Lane, Elkridge  Bushy Park Elementary School, 14601 Carrs Mill Road, Glenwood  Monarch Mills Apartments, 7600 Monarch Mills Way, Columbia  Forest Ridge Apartments, 5890 Stevens Forest Road, Columbia  Bethel Christian Academy, Campus 1, 8455 Savage Guilford Road, Savage Each weekday from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., all children younger than age 18 can go to one of the 12 meal sites and receive several “Grab-N-Go” items including a snack, lunch and dinner for the current day, and breakfast for the next morning. Children are encouraged to bring a bag each day to pick up the meals. There will be no meal services April 10 or April 13 due to the Easter holiday. In its first week, the school system provided 22,593 meals across the nine original meal sites in the county. The weekend meals will be provided at all locations except Bethel Christian Academy and the Forest Ridge and Monarch Mills apartment complexes.

‘It’s terrifying’: Service workers fear for their jobs, health as coronavirus spreads
.W
Last week, Konica Rice of Baltimore was looking forward to moving from a cramped apartment to a more spacious rental home closer to her kids’ school. Now, the food service worker at Johns Hopkins University doesn’t know what her future holds. Rice, 32, was shocked when Hopkins told students to stay home after spring break amid the national outbreak of the new coronavirus. She fears she will lose work and couldn’t afford to move if she does. “It’s totally unexpected," said Rice, a mother of three who lives in Edmondson Village. “Unemployment is not enough to live off of.” As cases of the respiratory disease grow in Maryland and throughout the country, daily life is being upended for people from every walk of life. But Rice and other low-paid service employees are especially worried. Their jobs may not provide benefits needed to cope with the outbreak and their interactions with the public put them at risk. “The coronavirus is quickly showing the cracks in our social insurance programs and labor protections,” said Melissa Boteach, vice president for income security and child care at the National Women’s Law Center. The organization is among those calling on Congress to aid families in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a sweeping bill Saturday that provides emergency paid sick leave for workers affected by coronavirus. The measure also would enhance unemployment insurance, provide free testing and increase federal Medicaid funding. President Donald J. Trump supports the legislation and it now heads to the Senate. Federal law in the United States currently doesn’t require employers to provide paid sick time. In the wake of the outbreak, some companies are putting new policies in place. After a Kentucky worker tested positive for the coronavirus, Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, announced this week that employees subject to mandatory quarantine or those infected with the virus will receive up to two weeks of pay. And Darden Restaurants, which owns the Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and other chain restaurants, announced a new paid sick leave policy for all hourly employees. A Darden spokesman said the company was working on the plan already, but sped it up amid the virus’ spread. Maryland is one of a dozen states that does require paid sick leave. In 2018, the state’s General Assembly overturned Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s veto of the Maryland Healthy Working Families Act. The law requires companies with at least 15 employees to let workers accrue up to five paid sick days a year. At smaller businesses, workers can earn unpaid leave. “Sick leave laws are an effective buffer against epidemics like this,” said Sally Dworak-Fisher, an attorney with the Public Justice Center in Baltimore. “We’re really hoping that employers will do their best to be flexible." But the outbreak is revealing the limits of the state’s law, Dworak-Fisher said. The law allows exemptions for groups of workers, including agricultural workers and temporary employees. “The law does not cover everyone, and that’s a problem,” she said. Nationally, 73% of private-sector workers have paid sick time, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the benefit varies across industries and wage levels. Of the lowest-earning of workers, only 30% have paid sick leave. More than 90% of the highest-earning workers do. Many low-wage workers are accustomed to working through illness, said Caryn York, CEO of the Job Opportunities Task Force in Baltimore, which works to remove barriers to employment. “The culture in this country has been, you just plow through,” she said. Now, many are worried about the outbreak because they lack health benefits — or they are afraid to ask for the sick time they’re legally entitled to for fear of losing their job, York said. Anxiety is high among employees at BWI Marshall Airport, said jetway mechanic Mark Souder of Southwest Baltimore. “We’re all scared,” Souder said. “Working at the airport, we get all these travelers from everywhere.” Souder, 58, works for Menzies Aviation, which contracts with several airlines. He said he didn’t go with his employer health plan because it was too expensive. Instead, he bought coverage through the state health insurance exchange. When he recently needed three days off to deal with a health problem, he had to use some vacation days because his boss said he hadn’t accrued enough sick time yet to cover it all. Local restaurants are reporting a drop in business, leading some to reduce hours for staff. Brian Boston, the chef and operating partner of the Milton Inn in Sparks, said the number of diners began dropping about a week ago and now is down by about half. “There’s nothing we can do but cut back on staff,” he said. “We’ve been going without a hostess, without bus people." On Wednesday, for example, he had reservations for about 70 people on Saturday night and doubted he would reach even 100. Normally, he would schedule eight servers for a Saturday night but thinks he will only ask four or five to work that night. “Even my regulars, they’re staying home,” he said. “We’re still seeing people, but we’ve had a lot of cancellations.” Waiter William Novakowski said he usually works about 22 hours a week over three nights as a second job — he works in medical claims and benefits management during the day. So far, he’s lost one shift to the slowdown at the restaurant. Many service workers are used to seasonal ups and downs, said Roxie Herbekian, president of Local 7 of Unite Here, which represents workers at hotels, casinos, event venues and food service, including at Hopkins and other universities. But the current upheaval has been a shock. “We’re really calling on the whole industry to be sympathetic to workers," including by maintaining health insurance for employees who lose hours, she said. “It’s going to be rough on folks.” Labor and community organizations also are pushing for state lawmakers to make it easier for people to get unemployment benefits and to be protected from evictions and foreclosures if they are laid off due to coronavirus, she said. Rice, the Hopkins dining worker, said she has been temporarily laid off before during university breaks. But usually she knows to plan ahead. For instance, her husband, who works in telemarketing, will make time to earn extra money driving for Uber or Lyft. She also felt the dining service workers were not kept in the loop as concerns increased about the coronavirus. “The only thing they kept telling us was to keep your hands clean, wash your hands," Rice said. "A lot of the information that we received in regards to the coronavirus, we received it from the news outlets and the students.” Hopkins’ food service is provided by Bon Appetit Management Co. Spokeswoman Bonnie Powell said Thursday that the food service remains open. “This is a fast-changing situation, and we are attempting to keep our staff informed as best we can while we explore the available options in partnership with the university,” she said in an email. A university spokeswoman said “dining service workers are highly valued here on campus — truly beloved by our students.” “We have not yet assessed our ongoing needs across a number of service contracts in this rapidly-evolving situation,” Hopkins spokeswoman Jill Rosen said in an email to The Baltimore Sun. “Right now our primary focus is on the steps we need to take to help slow the spread of COVID19 and to ensure the health and safety of everyone at Johns Hopkins.” Some Baltimore-area workers said they are seeing drastic cuts in their hours that could result in them losing health benefits. Amy Altvater, a 30-year-old banquet server at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, said she had been working up to six days a week up until a few weeks ago. But now event after event is being canceled and she’s down to working two days a week. She and her husband, who also works at the hotel, are afraid they will lose health insurance because the company provides it only if employees work an average of 30 hours weekly. "It’s terrifying to know that we could lose our health benefits over something we can’t even control,” she said. The Marriott Waterfront did not respond to a request for comment. Altvater, of Nottingham, said she lives paycheck to paycheck. She is worried about bills, but she’s most afraid of her 1-year-old daughter losing health coverage. “She’s my life,” she said. Baltimore Sun reporter Jean Marbella contributed to this article.

Baltimore Mayor Young asks Hogan to help get aid to small businesses affected by the coronavirus
.W
Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young is encouraging the governor to ask the federal government to enact a small business aid program in Maryland. The U.S. Small Business Administration’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program could help small businesses in Baltimore that may struggle due to the coronavirus, Young, a Democrat, wrote Friday to Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. For the program to be available to Baltimore businesses, the governor must make a request to the federal government, according to the mayor’s office. “Many small businesses, in particular the hospitality industry, are already experiencing reductions in their sales and as a consequence are laying off employees,” Young wrote. State Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz reached out to the Small Business Administration to get more information about the program, her office said. “We are working swiftly with Governor Hogan’s office to apply for this SBA designation as soon as possible and are reaching out to our business community, as well as to our Small Business Development Centers and local economic development partners, to identify businesses that may benefit from this assistance,” agency spokeswoman Karen Glenn Hood said in a statement. The National Federation of Independent Business, meanwhile, reported Friday that a survey of 300 of its member small businesses showed nearly a quarter of them already are affected by the outbreak of the new coronavirus. The negative effects include a mix of difficulty getting goods, slower sales and employees who are staying home sick, whether due to the virus or other illnesses. The NFIB survey was taken Tuesday and Wednesday, before Republican President Donald Trump addressed the nation about the virus and before several states, including Maryland, closed schools temporarily.

‘Nature is open’: Howard County Conservancy, local students celebrate Earth Day virtually due to coronavirus
.W
The Howard County Conservancy is celebrating its 30th anniversary and Earth Day’s 50th anniversary on Wednesday through a virtual Earth Day. “Like everything in everyone’s lives, [the original plan] all had to change,” said Meg Boyd, 49, executive director of the Howard County Conservancy. “Folks were really excited to participate and help us celebrate this year.” This year’s celebration is a full-day event. The conservancy is hosting two Facebook Live programs; one at 9 a.m. allowed viewers to meet the conservancy’s beekeeper and one at 1 p.m. will discuss backyard biodiversity. At 3 p.m., local officials — including Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, County Executive Calvin Ball and Howard schools Superintendent Michael Martirano — will appear on Google Hangouts, a video and instant messaging platform, to hear Howard County ninth graders present the Watershed Report Card, an annual tradition the conservancy hosts. “Certainly on Earth Day we knew we couldn’t let this pass without organizing something to celebrate,” said Boyd, an Elkridge resident. Ninth graders spent the school year conducting a stream study and detailing Watershed Report Cards in their biology classes. The students will grade the county on the health of its watershed, and about 300 students are expected to present their research on the watershed this year, according to Boyd. Oliver Song, 15, a freshman at Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, visited the Faulkner Stream during the fall to collect data for his report card. On Wednesday afternoon, in a 1-minute presentation, he and his partner will present their findings. “I was a little surprised. I thought it was going to be cancelled. I was pretty glad it wasn’t,” Oliver said. “Quarantine is a little boring. I [am] really looking forward to this.” To prepare for Wednesday, Oliver said he practiced his presentation with his family. Since he and his partner won’t be standing side by-side, they prepared a script to ensure their virtual presentation goes off without a hitch. “If it were in person, we probably would need more time to prepare,” Oliver said. “Preparing online is slightly less stressful because you’re not actually there.” County Council member Christiana Mercer Rigby will also be joining the virtual Watershed Report Card event. Despite the public health crisis, Rigby said it’s important to acknowledge the imminent threat of the climate crisis. “Climate change and environmental justice impact all aspects of our lives, from transportation to public health,” Rigby said. “I’m grateful to the students who come together to analyze the environmental conditions of our school watersheds and provide their recommendations virtually this year.” More than ever before, Boyd said it’s important to understand and appreciate the value of being outside and enjoying all that nature has to offer. The conservancy trails have seen an increased number of visitors since the start of the pandemic, she said. “It is so easy to enjoy and celebrate Earth Day in the current situation that we are in,” Boyd said. “The beauty of our mission is that people can go outside and that, even though many things are closed, nature is open.” Boyd said the conservancy will find a way to celebrate their 30th anniversary in person sometime in the future. “Right now we’re hoping that we might be able to do something in the fall,” she said.

South Carroll: Cancellations from coronavirus hit local programs, events; Woodbine church holds pancake dinner
.W
These recent days have been very tough for the South Carroll community due to the outbreak of the coronavirus in the state. Just as there have been many cancellations and closings throughout the country, the South Carroll community has been taking extreme measures to prevent the spread of the virus and to protect our community as much as possible. After the closings of schools and cancellations of programs in the Carroll County Public Schools system, the Carroll County Public Library has also closed; canceling all of their scheduled programs at least through March 29. All of the programs offered by the South Carroll library branches target children and adults, and they are done to promote learning and to enrich the minds of our community. Due to the closing of the Eldersburg branch library, and as a way to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the free hearing screenings scheduled for April 3 were canceled. This annual event is sponsored by the Lions Clubs in Southern Carroll County. This year’s hearing screening was supposed to be held at the Eldersburg library and was going to be conducted by Healthy Hearing and Balance from Westminster. The Lions hope to reschedule the hearing screenings later in the year. In addition, Lisa Wilson, the community risk reduction program manager from the Winfield Community Volunteer Fire Department, explained that the fire department has canceled their CPR/AED training that was scheduled for March 15 and was completely full. For more information about the library’s closure and the new dates for the March programs that were canceled, you may contact Andrea Berstler, at 443-487-1716 or at aberstler@carr.org. Also, for more information about the hearing screening and its new date, you may contact Lion Barbara at 410-795-3167. You may also contact fire Chief Mark Davis (mdfireman3@comcast.net) or EMS Capt. Chris Broussard (emtbroussard14@gmail.com) for any information about the Winfield fire department and their cancellations. Shrove Tuesday Pancake Dinner On Feb. 25, the Morgan Chapel United Methodist Church hosted a Shrove Tuesday Pancake Dinner, where the attendees were able to enjoy time with family and friends and also enjoy a delicious meal. Those who attended the event were served pancakes, sausage, applesauce and more. Sue Ann Johnson, one of the coordinators of this event and an active member of the church, said in an email interview that the dinner was a success, especially with it being the first Shrove Tuesday Pancake Dinner the church has had in many years. Johnson also added that about 75 people attended, including children and adults. “We received a lot of compliments on the food. We were especially happy to see those attending staying after their meal and visiting with each other,” Johnson said. “This was one of our main purposes of having the dinner — to have a place for the community to come and share a meal and fellowship. We most likely will have a pancake dinner again next year.” According to Johnson, the proceeds from the admission cost will go into the church’s general fund so that they may continue to serve the community through events like this one. For more information about this and other events hosted by the church, you may contact them at 410-970-2485. If you would like to visit Morgan Chapel United Methodist Church, they are located at 6750 Woodbine Road (intersection of Woodbine and Hoods Mill roads).

Eric DeCosta hopes this Ravens draft won’t be too different, but the coronavirus has already warped it
.W
“I don’t think it’s really going to be that much different,” Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta was saying Monday, and of course, he was right: The NFL draft was still starting April 23, the Ravens were still ordering their big board, and the world was still spinning. But there he was, addressing a question during the team’s annual predraft meeting from his home office, his headset on, a Zoom video conference call running, socially distanced from a staff of scouts and coaches who help drive draft operations and a few dozen reporters, homebound themselves, trying to figure out the same thing: What does a Ravens draft in a pandemic look like? In many ways, exactly the same as before the coronavirus. In some others, totally different. “I think the thing we come back to is, first and foremost — and it’s been this way ever since I know I got into the league — it’s really about the tape, how the guy plays, first and foremost,” DeCosta said. "We’ll spend a lot of time watching these guys. We’ll talk about it as a staff. ... So there are some challenges associated, nothing major, but we’re excited about the opportunity, and we think it’s going to work out well for us.” DeCosta believes the Ravens are well prepared for the NFL’s first virtual draft because they’ve done most of the legwork already. The team halted air travel less than a month ago, but by then, so much of its offseason scouting calendar had already been checked off: the 2019 college football season, the postseason all-star games, the league’s scouting combine, a few Pro Days across the country. Where the coronavirus has made scouting difficult — interviews, Pro Day results, medical rechecks — the Ravens have innovated or found another source. Virtual meetings with prospects have replaced road interviews or visits to Baltimore. Analytics staffers have filled in the gaps on athletic testing. Scouts have worked their sources for the details that flesh out a scouting report. “It’s been a little more challenging this year in terms of securing information,” DeCosta said. "Fortunately, we’ve been able to rely on our scouts, who I think are the best in the league, and also our coaches and their networks of contacts and people that can get us information to help us with the decision-making process. ... "We’ve met with these players, and we are always trying to assess their personalities, their drivers, their motivation, their love of the game, determination, work ethic and things like that. It all kind of plays together like a huge mosaic, and in the end, we’ll look at that, we’ll assess and we’ll find the best guys we can to make our team better.” But, DeCosta acknowledged, there are “probably some questions that we simply can’t answer.” Some of them might be character-related. Mississippi State inside linebacker Willie Gay Jr., one of the most athletic prospects at the position and a potential Day 2 pick for the linebacker-needy Ravens, was suspended eight games last season for what he said was cheating on a test in chemistry class. Ahead of the Bulldogs’ bowl game, he reportedly got into an altercation that left a teammate with a broken orbital bone. Injuries are another variable. Take Colorado wide receiver Laviska Shenault Jr., a first-round prospect before he ran a 4.58-second 40-yard dash at the combine and underwent surgery for a lingering core muscle problem. With a history of injuries and a drop-off in production last season, even new Buffaloes coach Karl Dorrell, a former NFL assistant coach who had scouted Shenault, acknowledged to the Denver Post that there would be “question marks because of this injury he has.” “How do we value those unknowns, and what impact do those unknowns have on the process?” DeCosta said. "That takes time. That’s not easy for some of us who like to have as much information as possible. It brings me back to what it was like in 1996-97, really, before the internet, before we had all this information, how we went about our jobs before we had the chance to bring in 30 players to Baltimore predraft and spend time with those guys. How did we accomplish our goals? "And I think some of our best drafts we’ve ever had were during that time frame, so we know it can be done. Like John [Harbaugh] said, every team is operating under the same parameters and the same rules. We’ve come up with a plan, we’ll adjust and we’ll figure it out.” On Monday afternoon, they were less certain how that plan would come together. Shortly before NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to teams indicating that teams were expected to “conduct their draft operations remotely, with club personnel separately located in their homes," DeCosta said he didn’t know where he’d run the Ravens’ draft. More than anything, he just wanted to be prepared for the opportunity. That meant taking calls from coaches and scouts, reviewing film, ranking prospects, deciding how to make a 14-2 team even better. Business as usual, in other words. Until, well, it isn’t. “I don’t have a lot of people knocking at this door,” DeCosta said Monday, pointing behind him, to a room with a bookcase, some framed photos and a potted plant, “other than my kids when it’s lunchtime.”

Six more Pleasant View residents die; coronavirus death toll in Carroll County jumps to 30, health department says 
.W
One month since the first case of coronavirus was announced in Carroll County, there have been 30 deaths out of 250 confirmed cases according to data released by the Carroll County Health Department late Monday afternoon. Eight of those deaths came after the health department reported data on Friday evening and six of those were residents at Mount Airy’s Pleasant View Nursing Home, where the COVID-19 death toll has risen to 24. Long-term care facilities account for 27 of the 30 Carroll County deaths. Of Carroll’s 250 positive tests for the coronavirus, 148 are connected to long-term care facilities. In addition to the 81 residents and 36 staff members (14 of whom live in Carroll) at Pleasant View, 29 residents and seven staff members (six who live in Carroll) from Carroll Lutheran Village in Westminster have tested positive. One death from Carroll Lutheran Village has been reported, so there have been two deaths at Carroll facilities that are not being named by the health department. There have been 102 positive tests that are considered community cases, meaning they are unrelated to the long-term care facilities. The health department announced that there have been three community deaths attributed to COVID-19, up from one through Friday. According to the health department, 21 people who have tested positive have been released from isolation, meaning at least three days have passed since their recovery, which is defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications, improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and, at least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared. Largely because of the outbreak at Pleasant View, Mount Airy has the highest number of cases among ZIP codes in Carroll County. Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy first announced two residents with COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, on March 27 and now has 117 total cases. The Maryland Department of Health on Sunday began sharing the number of COVID-19 cases by ZIP code. The map shows there are 103 cases in Mount Airy ZIP code 21771, 42 in Westminster 21157, 40 in Westminster 21158, 28 in Sykesville 21784, 14 in Woodbine 21797, nine in Hampstead 21074, and nine in Marriottsville 21104. There was no data on ZIP codes in Finksburg, Keymar, Manchester, New Windsor, Taneytown, Union Bridge, or Upperco. Data for ZIP codes with fewer than seven cases is not being reported by MDH. Ed Singer, Carroll County health officer, said ZIP code data is being shared in an effort to be transparent, but there are some key points people should understand when they read the numbers. “Mount Airy has high numbers, but most of the cases in that area are from the nursing home outbreak there,” Singer said. "And even if you live in an area with a low number of cases, you still need to take all the same precautions, because the coronavirus is spreading throughout the county. We know the stay at home order is a burden, but we are counting on everyone to continue social distancing to protect our community.” Anyone feeling ill should contact their health care professional. Carroll County Health Department is operating a COVID-19 hotline, available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week, at 410-876-4848. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. All emergencies should continue to call 911.

Howard County’s Greta Sobieski helps a Towson teen with disabilities stay connected during the coronavirus pandemic
.W
When the coronavirus outbreak upended her 16-year-old daughter’s routine, Sarah D. Parr was worried the teen — who is deaf and autistic — would regress and spend her days doing little else than playing on her iPad. While state residents were asked to isolate themselves in their home, the League for People with Disabilities offered the family a reprieve: Her daughter Rhiannon “Skyler” Parr’s support counselor, Greta Sobieski, now would make house calls. Sobieski, a 24-year-old recent University of Tennessee graduate, is fluent in American Sign Language and has earned Skyler’s trust over the months they’ve worked together. Visiting Skyler’s home in Towson, Sobieski has focused on teaching the teen life skills, such as showering instead of taking baths and helping to make her own meals and snacks. “When I come in, I can offer her quality time and companionship, someone she can hang out with,” said Sobieski, of Howard County. “And we find things to let her exercise her brain muscle a little bit.” The pandemic has closed day programs where Marylanders with disabilities can learn and spend time with friends. Support counselors, like Sobieski, aides and services providers have had to find new ways to reach their clients. Before the pandemic, Sobieski and Skyler typically would spend four hours a day together at the League for People With Disabilities. Then, Sobieski would drive the teen home and stay for 30 minutes to get Skyler settled. Now, they are together six hours each weekday. Sobieski knows to bring pipe cleaners that she braids for Skyler to untangle, which calms her and gives her a sensory experience she enjoys. They paint together, work on puzzles and practice handwriting. And Sobieski is trying to use one of Skyler’s favorite iPad apps that lets her style the hair of different characters to entice her to wash and do her own. The time Sobieski and Skyler spend together gives Parr and her husband, Guy Parr III, much needed respite, Skyler’s mother said. Parr is a stay-at-home mom and her husband is locksmith. Having Sobieski, Parr said, allows her a chance to breathe — or catch up on rest after the nights when Skyler doesn’t sleep. “Greta and her colleagues are lifelines to special needs families," Parr said. Parr said it has been a hard road trying to fill her daughter’s needs. The family had to fight hard for the services Skyler receives, including the League’s and the specialized Trellis School in Sparks. She does not want the virus outbreak to set Skyler or the family back. And in many ways, Skyler is a typical teenager who is less receptive to requests from her parents than someone like Sobieski with whom she shares a friendship. “Mom says to do something, good luck with that,” Parr said. “Greta says to do something, she is much more inclined.” Know a hero?

Howard Community College moving to online classes for the rest of the semester due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
Howard Community College is finishing its spring semester through remote instruction as the new coronavirus continues to spread across the state. Starting March 30, all HCC classes are moving online for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. Last week, the college announced its spring break was being moved to March 16 through March 22 and, until March 29, all credit and noncredit classes would be canceled. “The health, safety and well-being of all faculty, staff and students are the highest priorities as Howard Community College makes critical decisions in this unprecedented time,” Howard Community College President Kate Hetherington said in a statement Thursday. All campus events are canceled through April 27, and that decision will be reassessed as new developments arise. All HCC athletics teams have suspended all activities for the remainder of the spring season. Across the state, other colleges and universities have closed for the remainder of their spring semesters, moving to online instruction instead. McDaniel College, Morgan State University and Johns Hopkins University have announced their students will not be returning to campuses. The University System of Maryland announced Thursday morning it is likely to end face-to-face classes and move to remote learning. A final decision is expected to be made Thursday evening. As of Thursday, there have been at least 107 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Maryland, according to state officials, with 16 of those in Howard County. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday that a 5-year-old girl in Howard County has tested positive, the first state case with a child. Baltimore Sun reporter Liz Bowie contributed to this article.

A modern twist keeps sacred tradition alive as Passover Zoom unites Baltimore family separated by coronavirus
.W
At 76 years old, Dr. Margaret Sharfstein knows she really shouldn’t be going to Eddie’s Market right now. Not when she’s considered at high risk for complications from the coronavirus. But she needed apples to make charoset for her family, just as she has for decades. The dish — a mix of fruits, nuts and wine — is a staple of a Passover Seder. So Margaret’s son dropped off a box of apples Sunday on the doorstep of her North Baltimore home. By Wednesday afternoon, she had transformed them into fresh charoset and filled up a quart container. She left that outside in a box for her grandson to pick up. That night, three generations of the Sharfstein family savored the traditional dish, connected by a treasured old recipe and a Zoom video conference, even as a modern plague kept them apart. “How’s the charoset?” asked Margaret, leaning into a microphone. “Oh,” her daughter-in-law replied, “it’s excellent.” Passover, the holiday during which Jewish families recount their ancestors’ storied exodus from slavery in Egypt, is always a big deal in the Sharfstein household. But in this family of doctors — one of Margaret’s sons is Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, a former Baltimore health commissioner and former state health secretary — everyone agreed there was no way to get together this year. Instead, Josh and his two siblings got to work organizing a virtual Seder and printing out copies of a Haggadah prayer book from 30minuteseder.com. Dr. Sarah Kawasaki, his sister, who works in addiction medicine, said they’re lucky their elderly parents are tech-savvy and have adapted easily to Zoom. In the last two weeks alone, Margaret has been to a virtual bat mitzvah and a virtual shiva, a ritual of Jewish mourning. But it’s hard on Sarah’s three young kids not to be with Grandma and Grandpa on Passover. They tuned in from central Pennsylvania, while another brother and his two kids joined the livestream from Tennessee. The elder Sharfsteins live in Guilford, while Josh’s family is in Mount Washington. When they logged on at 6 p.m., the grandchildren waved excitedly at the camera, while Margaret snapped photos on her iPhone of the digital family reunion. “Let’s see how long your hair is,” she said to her 9-year-old granddaughter. “It grew even longer since the last time I saw you.” Everything about a Seder is carefully prescribed, and steeped in tradition. The Hebrew word “seder” means “order,” and twice, Jews are asked to wash their hands as part of the ritual meal. The tie-in to the frequent hand-washing recommended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus didn’t escape the senior generation. “We’re washing our hands 50 times this year,” joked Dr. Steven Sharfstein, the family patriarch, a psychiatrist and former CEO of the Sheppard Pratt Health System, before quizzing each grandchild on how many times that day they’d scrubbed. Later, they dipped their fingers in wine to commemorate the 10 plagues God is said to have sent down upon the Egyptians. Steven pulled out props to demonstrate each one: little stuffed frogs and “wild beasts.” “We want to be free of this 11th plague,” he said. References to COVID-19 are unavoidable for the medically oriented Sharfsteins. Sarah has been trying to juggle her regular work battling the opioid crisis with the new public health emergency. On Wednesday alone, Josh participated in three different coronavirus briefings, including one with leaders of the Maryland General Assembly. He’s now a vice dean at Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health. He’s trying to spread the word about how seriously people need to be taking COVID-19. Two weeks ago, he held a telephone town hall with Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott. One caller asked if it was safe for him to celebrate Passover in person with his extended family. Josh choked up a little before telling the man: “No.” “We have to put our health first,” he said. It’s hard for him to grapple with how deeply the virus is changing lives and rituals. “A tradition like this, it’s not just something that you’ve always done,” Josh said. “Your parents have always done it. Their parents always did it.” The Seder traditionally ends with people singing, “Next year in Jerusalem.” The Sharfsteins hope that next year, they will simply be with each other.

Patriot League, Towson and Johns Hopkins suspend spring seasons over coronavirus fears
.W
Baltimore-area college sports teams were hit with a flood of cancellations and postponements Thursday as league conferences put spring sports and tournaments on hold due to coronavirus fears. The Big Ten announced that it has cancelled it’s men’s basketball tournament this week, including Maryland’s game on Friday night. Johns Hopkins and Towson University also announced the suspension of its spring sports programs and the Patriot League put its entire spring program on hold. The Northeast Conference canceled the remainder of the NEC Women’s Basketball Tournament, which was scheduled to have a game at Mount St. Mary’s on Thursday night. Johns Hopkins Director of Athletics Jennifer S. Baker announced today the school suspended activities for all seven of its spring athletic teams through April 12. The affected programs include men’s and women’s lacrosse, baseball, men’s and women’s tennis and men’s and women’s track. The decision comes as the university monitors the global COVID-19 outbreak. Johns Hopkins joins a growing number of conferences and individual colleges and universities announcing similar plans for their athletic programs. The Johns Hopkins indoor track, wrestling and swimming programs will be permitted to close out their season over the next 10 days as each of those teams is participating in NCAA Championship competition. The NCAA announced on Wednesday, March 11 that only team personnel, essential staff, media and immediate family members of each participating student-athlete would be permitted to attend NCAA Championship events. Towson suspended the remainder of the athletics varsity spring season for all 19 sports. TU Athletics said in a news release that it was “following suit with several conferences and schools across the country on the recommendations of health officials and medical professionals to reduce the risk from the COVID-19 outbreak. TU is expecting additional announcements from the Colonial Athletic Association.” The Patriot League, which includes teams from Navy and Loyola Maryland, issued the following statement: "Recognizing that the health and safety of our students and broader communities is our priority, and based on the ongoing spread of COVID 19 (2019 novel Coronavirus), the Patriot League Council of Presidents has made the difficult and challenging decision to cancel all spring athletics practices and competitions through the remainder of the academic year. "The majority of Patriot League institutions have announced a temporary or semester-long transition to remote learning. While we recognize the deep disappointment that will be felt by our student-athletes, coaches, and communities, a continuation of spring seasons is untenable. “The decision will be effective Monday, March 16. Individual institutions will decide the championship participation status of winter teams and student-athletes who have qualified."

Our View: Thumbs down for heinous killings in Mount Airy; thumbs up for county actions on coronavirus
.W
THUMBS DOWN: Do you want the good news first, or the bad? These days, there’s much more bad than we’re typically used to here in Carroll County. We’d be remiss, though, if we didn’t acknowledge a particularly painful tragedy that, unfortunately, came in an already extremely difficult time. On April 2, a 35-year-old Gaithersburg man shot and killed his estranged wife, 36-year-old Heather Zujkowski and 18-year-old Noah Homayouni, a student at South Carroll High School. Police believe the shooter, who later killed himself in a standoff with Montgomery County police, fired 30 rounds from a rifle. An act of violence this brazen, this cruel rarely strikes the communities of Carroll County. We must stand united against such horrendous gun violence. That it came during an anxious, uncertain time, when the coronavirus is sweeping through the country, killing many and forcing much of society to a halt, makes the news harder to process. In this tragedy, we’ve lost valued members of the community. Zujkowski, a mother of three, had been working with the town on installing an all-inclusive playground. “Heather was very sweet and kind. You could see the love she had for her children,” Mayor Patrick Rockinberg told us. Homayouni was described by a South Carroll lacrosse teammate as “probably the most hard-working kid” and had been signed to play lacrosse at Howard Community College this fall. South Carroll senior Dylan O’Neill told us, “He was very determined to be the best he could.” Zujkowski and Homayouni were both senselessly taken from this community far too early, and for that we are angry. Mount Airy is in profound grieving. We’re thinking of the family members and dear friends of the victims. May their memories be a blessing. THUMBS UP: Carroll County officials have their hands full dealing with the spreading coronavirus and the ripples the pandemic has sent through just about every facet of life here. We know they’re working hard to make sure the local government continues to function — and will continue to. There are certainly frightening challenges that go with that. We won’t say that every single decision being made recently is the right one. But there are at least a few worth mentioning. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers visited Westminster on April 3 to assess the viability of Carroll County Agriculture Center’s Shipley Arena as a potential temporary hospital for treating coronavirus patients. Although there’s still no guarantee that will come to pass. Stephen Wantz, president of the Board of County Commissioners, said he helped set the visit in motion by reaching out to the Corps. “I wanted to get on the list of facilities they were looking at ASAP.” And in the event Shipley Arena is chosen as a site for a temporary hospital, Carroll would be taking a leadership role in the region. It could be used as a regional facility, helping not just COVID-19 patients from Carroll County, but from nearby jurisdictions as well. We certainly hope the arena would never need to be put into motion, but the reality is that there could still be a serious spike in positive cases running up against a shortage of resources for treating all those patients. Reaching out to the Corps is good forward thinking. The county commissioners also acted recently to postpone the annual tax sale and create a grant program for small businesses to ease the financial hardship some have experienced as so much economic activity has ground to a halt. Residents with unpaid tax accounts as of April 1 will be mailed “second notice” bills, but penalties will be frozen as of March 31. Interest will continue to accrue monthly on past-due property taxes. As Wantz said, “People are in tough shape and it’s going to get tougher.” Taxes will still be due, of course, but this measure to ease immediate financial burdens on the average Carroll countian will likely be a great relief for many. As for small businesses, the county is offering grants through an unused small business loan fund of more than $800,000 within its budget. The grants will be good for up to $1,250 per business, and up to $500,000 of the small business loan fund will be used. It will be just about impossible to avoid at least some local businesses never reopening, but it’s important to try and minimize that damage. This is a good use of available funds that we hope can make a difference. In closing, we also liked seeing the county hold its first-ever virtual town hall meeting Thursday night to answer community questions about the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope it wasn’t the last. Despite some early technical holdups, it seemed to run just fine. In this pandemic, it’s absolutely essential that public officers communicate well, and often, with the people. This was good work to that end.

Carroll County Public Schools will not administer state standardized tests due to coronavirus
.W
Maryland schools need not need administer statewide assessments this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and the closing of public schools, the United States Department of Education has determined, so Carroll County Public Schools students will not be taking the usual round of standardized tests this spring. State Superintendent Karen Salmon applied for a waiver from the federal government. Normally these tests would be required under the the Every Student Succeeds Act and preparation and testing would be getting underway at this point int the school year. “The lack of test administration in Maryland will not affect annual accountability determinations, be used to identify schools for support and improvement, or to provide data on Maryland’s and local report cards for assessment and accountability information for the 2019-20 school year,” according to a news release from CCPS. Carroll County Public Schools will not administer state assessments for math, language arts, science, social studies or alternative assessments. They will also not administer the climate survey which accompanied state testing for the first time last year. The 2019-20 school year was planned to be the first year of a new set of tests called the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) that would replace the standardized tests called the PARCC, or Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers.

Orioles-Red Sox game scheduled to be held at Little League World Series canceled due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
If baseball resumes in any form this summer, the Orioles won’t make their scheduled trip to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to play in Major League Baseball’s annual Little League Classic. The Sunday-night showcase game during the Little League World Series scheduled for Aug. 23 between the Orioles and Red Sox has been canceled. The announcement was part of a statement from Little League officials that they wouldn’t be hosting the youth baseball world championship tournament because of the coronavirus pandemic. Little League said MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association are committed to the game returning in 2021. “Delivering this news comes with a very heavy heart,” Little League International board of directors chairman Hugh E. Tanner said in a statement. “We have never had to cancel our World Series tournaments, but, right now, as our world comes together, we must do everything we can to help stem the spread of this deadly virus.” The announcement cited the difficulties of playing the required qualifying tournaments, possible international travel issues, and public health considerations as it relates to testing and hosting large public events. It was difficult to imagine the Orioles and Red Sox playing such a game in August, given the game was meant to be tacked on to a series at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and it’s unclear whether the MLB season will take place at home ballparks. The Little League Classic would have been a rare national television opportunity for the Orioles, with the game broadcast on ESPN and enjoyed by the players, coaches and families of the Little League World Series teams. When the game was announced last summer, Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said he and the team were looking forward to it. “I know just watching it on TV how much fun it looks like players have, and the interaction with the kids,” Hyde said. "Obviously, Williamsport is something we all dreamed about as kids trying to get there and play in the Little League World Series. I’ve never been there. To go there and experience that and meet everybody up there, and to play on Sunday Night Baseball in that kind of environment is going to be a really cool experience. “It’s something that I always wanted to do as a kid. You grow up watching it on ABC, and it’s something where you’re trying to get there as a kid. We fell a little short, but obviously it’s something that’s a really, really cool thing. Americana.”

Ocean City extends beach, boardwalk closures to April 30 following coronavirus stay-at-home order
.W
Ocean City is extending the closure of its beach and boardwalk to visitors as officials follow a stay-at-home order from Gov. Larry Hogan, urging people not to travel to the Eastern Shore beach town amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The Worcester County town’s beach and boardwalk are closed to anyone who lives outside the corporate limits of the Town of Ocean City, according to the mayor and City Council officials. The closures will remain in effect until at least April 30, officials said Monday. The Inlet Parking Lot will also be closed for the duration of that time. “Officials are no longer asking visitors and non-resident property owners to stay home, they are directing them not to travel to Ocean City,” officials said in a news release Monday, echoing the governor’s stay-at-home order. “At this time, we continue to request that visitors postpone traveling to Ocean City and that our non-resident property owners reframe [refrain] from traveling to Ocean City as well,” he added. For town residents, restaurants on the boardwalk will remain open for carryout orders only and people are asked to limit groups of people to “no more than two adults and children at any time,” the city officials wrote. Earlier in March, Meehan had urged tourists to stay away from the resort town, but stopped short of closing the beach and boardwalk down. Gov. Larry Hogan has ordered all bars, restaurants, schools and movie theaters closed and asked residents to avoid group gatherings larger than 10 people in an attempt to stem the spread of the disease. The governor has also repeatedly taken issue with people treating the shutdown as a sort of extended spring break, again expressing his frustration with uninformed residents on “Meet the Press” Sunday morning. As of Sunday, there have been at least 244 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, including two in Worcester County.

'I’m just blessed’: Former Maryland OL Ellis McKennie III thankful after father’s recovery from coronavirus
.W
Ellis McKennie III has not given much thought to the NFL draft, and for good reason. McKennie, who last fall completed his fifth year of eligibility as a starting offensive lineman for the Maryland football team, has been preoccupied by the health of his father Ellis McKennie Jr., who was afflicted by the coronavirus. After 15 days in a medically induced coma, the elder McKennie was discharged Monday from the hospital — a huge relief for the younger McKennie, who grew up in Randallstown and graduated from McDonogh. “Everything took a backseat,” McKennie, 22, said Wednesday afternoon. “My professors have been extremely understanding as I finish up my master’s [in public policy] right now, but it’s kind of hard to focus on something else while this was going on with my father. I spent a lot of my days at the hospital, trying to sit there, and even when I came back, it was hard to switch my mind into work mode or something else just knowing what he was going through or what my mom was going through.” Ellis McKennie Jr., 51, began to feel nauseated and tired and started coughing sometime in March, according to Jodi McKennie, his wife of 22 years. Not one to normally complain, McKennie was confined to bed in their home in McSherrystown, Pennsylvania, for two days, and after talking to his brother, he asked his wife to take him to the emergency room at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in nearby Hanover on March 18. Jodi McKennie, 52, said that her husband was diagnosed with pneumonia that day, and she visited him the next morning. But later that afternoon, her husband informed her that he could no longer have any visitors. On March 21, Ellis McKennie Jr. tested positive for COVID-19. Jodi McKennie and their 14-year-old daughter, Ava, self-quarantined themselves in the house, and Ellis McKennie III stayed with his aunt. “That was an extremely scary time,” the younger McKennie said. “It was more difficult for me because I couldn’t be with my mom and my sister, who were quarantined at home. Being separated from them made it a lot worse. And I couldn’t go visit my dad because the hospitals had been shut down by the virus. That made it all difficult to deal with. The best we [he and 29-year-old brother Stayce] could do was sit in the hospital parking lot. There was a feeling of helplessness that I tried to overcome during that time.” On March 23, the elder McKennie was moved to the intensive care unit and placed into a medically induced coma that night. His breathing deteriorated to the point in which, on March 27, a ventilator was controlling 100% of his breathing. Jodi McKennie said that she relayed the information to Candice Christie, the mother of Terps senior offensive lineman Sean Christie and a nurse in New York. “She goes, ‘Honey, I love you, but I want you to know that this does not look good. From a friend’s point, I want you to be positive and to pray, but from a nurse’s perspective, this doesn’t look like he’s going to make it out of this,’” Jodi McKennie said Wednesday. “There was probably five days of him being on a ventilator where I was just waiting for that phone call from the hospital telling me that he didn’t make it through the night,” she continued, adding that her request to wear protective gear for one final chance to say goodbye to her husband was denied. “Everybody who reached out to me to pray, I just kept saying, ‘He’s going to die alone.’ That’s the part that broke my heart.” But on April 6 at 2 p.m., a nurse called Jodi McKennie, informing her that someone wanted to talk to her. It was her husband, who spoke a few words before handing the phone back to the nurse. A week later, Ellis McKennie Jr. was discharged from the hospital and went home, beating the family-targeted date of April 19, his birthday. His recovery continues to astound his son. “It came so fast,” he said. “We had gone from fearing that we were going to lose him to having him out of the hospital in a week. I can only point to prayers and the help and support we got from so many people that showed how much they cared about him and our family.” Jodi McKennie said that she hopes people grasp the full weight of the dangers of the coronavirus. “We’re both healthy. So we weren’t scared,” she said. “It wasn’t something that we were worrying about. But it can get to everybody, and I thank God that he was healthy so that he could get through it. I do believe there is hope, but I also believe that we need to take it seriously. It’s dangerous.” Although Ellis McKennie Jr. lost 23 pounds and has yet to regain his sense of taste, he is able to climb up and down the stairs under his own power and talk to his family, according to Jodi McKennie. Ellis McKennie III, who started at every position along the offensive line except left guard last fall and became the first Terp to achieve that feat in the same season since 1997, has since returned to College Park to concentrate on his preparation for the NFL draft. He said he has talked to a handful of teams, who have expressed interest in his versatility. Whether he gets drafted or not, McKennie – who roots for the Philadelphia Eagles and admires Hall of Fame left tackle Jonathan Ogden – said that he will enjoy the proceedings knowing that his father is healthy. “I’m really happy that hopefully, we’re on the backside of all of that now and can kind of get the focus back to my future and what’s going on,” he said. “I’m just blessed to have my father back to experience all of that with me.”

College seniors trade emotion for acceptance after coronavirus ends seasons: ‘I’m still devastated about it'
.W
On Thursday morning, Kevin Broadus gathered his Morgan State men’s basketball team during a shootaround before its Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament quarterfinal against Bethune-Cookman and did his best to prepare the players for the possibility that either the league or the NCAA might suspend or cancel the tournament because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. That’s when senior forward David Syfax Jr. spoke up, Broadus said. “He said, ‘Forget that, Coach. I would die to play in this game,’” Broadus recalled. “I said, ‘Really? Think about what you’re saying.’” The day after the NCAA canceled all winter and spring sports for the remainder of the academic calendar year, Syfax had not budged from his previous stance. “This is pretty much my life,” he said while traveling on the team bus returning to Baltimore from the Norfolk Scope Arena in Virginia. “It’s been something I’ve been doing since I was a baby. I would die for something that I love, and basketball is something that I love.” Syfax’s perspective is one of a variety of points of views among area college seniors who suddenly and shockingly watched their final seasons end without fanfare or a resolution. The swiftness by which the NCAA and its conferences put athletics on hiatus has left some student-athletes unfulfilled and frustrated. “I get that it’s a lot bigger than just the lacrosse world, but to us student-athletes, this was tough,” said Meghan Doherty, an Ellicott City resident and Mount Hebron graduate who is a redshirt senior defender for the Maryland women’s lacrosse team. “We work our whole lives to get where we are today and to be successful on the biggest platform that we can, and to have it just taken away so abruptly, it’s heartbreaking to me. "I’m still devastated about it. I don’t know how angry I can be because it’s bigger than us and there are a lot of people being affected by it more directly, but this is definitely heartbreaking. It’ll hit me in the middle of the day, and I’ll start crying again. It has definitely taken its toll on me.” There are at least 5,100 cases of the coronavirus in the United States and at least 91 deaths, according to federal, state and local agencies and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to CNN. Worldwide, the number of cases has passed the 194,000 mark with more than 7,500 deaths, according to NPR. Lauren Coleman was stunned by the news, which the Towson redshirt senior thrower received via phone call from coach Mike Jackson while she was resting in her hotel room in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She was scheduled to compete in the shot put in the NCAA indoor track and field championships the very next day after becoming the program’s first athlete to qualify for the national meet. “I honestly was speechless,” said Coleman, a two-time Colonial Athletic Association and ECAC champion in the shot put who called her parents George and Deborah back home in Bowie. “There were a lot of mixed emotions going on. … And then when I saw it was happening to every senior across the country, I couldn’t dwell too much on it. There was a bigger situation on hand. It wasn’t right to feel sorry for myself. It was about what’s best for people across the country and across the world.” Marie Dickson, a senior defender for the Mount St. Mary’s women’s lacrosse team, echoed Coleman’s big-picture sentiment. But she admitted that her initial reaction to the NCAA’s decision was more emotional. “I’m not a big crier, but the tears kind of didn’t stop,” she said. “Especially being a senior, I was with my classmates, but once I saw underclassmen coming up to me and saying things, it just kind of didn’t stop. Then it also started to sink in that it’s actually real. At first, you’re like, ‘This can’t be happening. This is a joke.’ Then it started to sink in when everybody was like, ‘I’m sorry.’” Every athlete has since returned home, but that is hardly an escape from the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced governors to shut down restaurants, movie theaters and gyms. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan ordered similar closures Monday, which left Zach Roberts, a Fallston resident and graduate who is a redshirt senior defenseman for the Mount St. Mary’s men’s lacrosse team, without a gym to work out and release some pent-up energy. “I even went into Coach [Tom Gravante]’s office afterward and said, ‘I don’t really know what to do with myself for the next couple weeks,’” he said. “To be honest, none of us know what to do.” Kali Hartshorn, a senior attacker for the Maryland women’s lacrosse team, said the concept of a spring break is a foreign concept to her. “I feel like I’m getting a little stir crazy now,” she said with a laugh. “I need to find something to do.” As disappointing as the ending has been, Coleman, the Towson track and field thrower, said the coronavirus pandemic will not color her memories of her college career. “It’s definitely a big thing to point out,” she said. “It’s a huge event that shocked the whole sports world. So it’s not about me and my senior year. It’s more than just me. It’s affected the world and all of sports. So it’s not casting a shadow on my senior year.” Many athletes said they have grown to accept the fate of their lost seasons and no longer harbor anger. Syfax, the Morgan State basketball player, said he has taken solace in the program’s best finish – which included the No. 5 seed in the MEAC tournament – since the 2016-17 season. “No bitterness,” he said. “Everything is happiness in my heart. I feel like whatever happened, it happened for a reason.”

Activists urge Baltimore officials to support the vulnerable, be proactive in preparing for arrival of coronavirus
.W
Nearly a dozen activists demanded a meeting with city and state officials and urged them to take steps to protect vulnerable residents of Baltimore from the potential impact of the coronavirus at a rally in front of City Hall on Saturday. Sharon Black of the People’s Power Assembly, civil rights activist Marvin “Doc” Cheatham, and Jennie Lu of National Nurses United were among those who made the case that because the poor and the homeless are generally the hardest hit during outbreaks of illness, the city must take specific steps to keep those groups safe should COVID-19 eventually hit Baltimore. So far, each of the three reported cases of the illness in Maryland has been in Montgomery County. Black read a list of 16 demands to onlookers and reporters, including a request that city officials use their emergency powers to create a plan to distribute food to vulnerable families, to suspend evictions and foreclosures for infected people and to feed school children who depend on school lunches each day should schools be closed. They also demanded that plans be put in place to help the homeless in shelters and in the streets and to help immigrants who might be fearful of approaching government officials for assistance. “Concerns for the elderly and the poor, the homeless, prisoners and our immigrant population need to be addressed sooner rather than later,” Black said, adding that the demands were just the opening requests in what she hopes will be a series of meetings between activists and city and state leaders, including health department officials. Lu told those gathered that a recent survey of nurses showed that only 29 percent believe their hospitals are sufficiently prepared for the current outbreak and argued that it’s especially important to protect “front line” health-care workers, both for their sakes and for the good of their potential patients. “If nurses are not protected, then nobody is protected,” she said. Cheatham urged religious leaders to counsel precaution against the virus at their services Sunday. “It’s estimated that 10,000 people will be in church [in Baltimore] tomorrow,” he said. “We’re challenging pastors, ministers, imams and rabbis to help get this word out.” He also demanded an emergency meeting of local officials on the subject this week. A spokesman for Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

As Maryland horse racing tracks close to public, officials monitoring coronavirus impact on Triple Crown races
.W
The Maryland Jockey Club on Thursday announced the closures of its raceways at Pimlico Race Course, Laurel Park and Rosecroft Raceway to the public effective immediately, following state officials’ orders to cancel or postpone large public gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Jockey Club, which oversees the race tracks on behalf of The Stronach Group, the Canadian owners, said in the Thursday news release that live racing events at Laurel Park and Rosecroft Raceway will continue as scheduled but with limited personnel licensed by the Maryland Racing Commission in attendance. The Jockey Club joined track operators from California to New York in announcing temporary spectator bans at its facilities. The most immediate impacts will occur at Laurel Park, where racing is scheduled on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. But the empty stands won’t be as much of a shock as they might be in other sports; the average crowd for a race day at Laurel Park is about 500. Most hardcore fans engage with the sport through remote betting, which won’t be affected. “The good thing about our business is that a lot of it is conducted online,” said Alan Foreman, longtime general counsel for the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association. “In that respect, we have have an advantage over other sports.” The current meet at Laurel is scheduled to continue through April before the scene shifts to Pimlico for a short meet built around the Preakness Stakes. The bigger looming issue is the status of the 145th Preakness, scheduled to be run May 16. With crowds exceeding 130,000, the race is the most attended annual sporting event in Maryland, and it generates revenues that support the state’s racing industry for the rest of the year. A Jockey Club spokesman said track officials are taking a wait-and-see approach with their signature event but added that the Stronach Group has created a task force to monitor the spread of the virus and stay in regular contact with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Thursday, Churchill Downs Inc. said preparations for the May 2 Kentucky Derby are moving forward, but the company’s statement alluded to possible postponement for the first leg of the Triple Crown. “With the event still seven weeks away, a decision will be made closer to that date, with respect to postponing the event until later in the year, using the most recent information while working with and seeking guidance from public health experts and authorities,” the statement read. Foreman said that if a delay occurs, the operators of the three Triple Crown races will likely act in concert. “But we’re all just guessing at this point,” he said. “None of us have ever dealt with anything like this.” The decision to close Maryland’s tracks to spectators comes as state officials look to minimize the spread of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, the upper respiratory disease that has sickened more than 130,000 people worldwide and caused some 4,700 deaths. In Maryland, 12 positive cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, the same day Gov. Larry Hogan and other officials announced the two-week closure of public schools, the activation of the National Guard and the visitor restrictions at senior centers, hospitals, prisons and government buildings. Late Wednesday, Hogan announced the first instance of a state resident who had tested positive without having traveled abroad. This, he said at a Thursday news conference, motivated the decisions behind the state’s adjustments. The horse racing restriction follows several high-profile setbacks in the sports industry amid mounting coronavirus fears, including the cancellation of the NCAA Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, the suspension of the remainder of the NBA, NHL and MLS seasons and the end of spring training for all Major League Baseball players and a two-week delay to the start of the MLB regular season. Fans looking to watch the horse races can tune in via the 1/ST BET and Xpressbet apps, according to the jockey club.

Harford school board waives graduation requirements, grade promotion, other policies as it grapples with coronavirus impacts
.W
A handful of polices of the Harford County Board of Education related to qualifying students to complete the end of the school year, as well as graduate from high school, were waived by the school board Tuesday. The status of the final quarter of the current academic year, which has been upended by the statewide closure of public schools to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, remains an open question as Harford County Public Schools officials craft strategies to not only deliver day-to-day instruction to thousands of homebound students but also determine how they can successfully complete the year. “These requests are being made in light of the circumstances of the federal declaration of emergency, the state emergency declaration and the closure of schools ordered by the state superintendent,” Patrick Spicer, general counsel for the school system, said during a school board meeting held via teleconference Tuesday evening. Public schools throughout Maryland were closed March 16 and are scheduled to remain that way at least through April 24. “We do not know for certain as to what will happen after that date,” Spicer said. The 10-member board approved, unanimously, requests to waive policies that govern graduation requirements, promotion from one grade to the next, report cards and grade marking systems and final exams for high school students. The board also approved a request to extend the deadline for board members and select school system officials to file financial disclosure statements from April 30 to June 30 as well as waiving the policy on public participation during school board meetings in light of the logistical challenges of holding a meeting through teleconference — the waiver only applied to Tuesday’s meeting. Graduation policy The policy on qualifications for graduation was a key topic of discussion among board members and HCPS leaders. Students must, under standard Harford County policy, earn at least 26 credits over four years of high school to graduate. The state standard for graduation is at least 21 credits, which will remain in effect “because that’s state law" and cannot be waived by a local board, according to Spicer. One credit is equal to a one-year high school course, according to HCPS Superintendent Sean Bulson. “The idea is, not knowing this year the circumstances some of our students will be in with regard to the ability to earn those credits, that will just give us some flexibility,” Bulson said of the policy waiver. The superintendent noted that most superintendents in Maryland’s other 23 school districts have either brought a similar graduation policy waiver request to their boards or plan to do so, based on a recent conference call he had with his counterparts. Board member David Bauer asked if he and his colleagues could postpone a decision on waiving the graduation policy “since we’re still figuring out what is happening with grading for the fourth quarter.” The third quarter of the year was scheduled to end in late March, according to the 2019-2020 calendar, but that has been extended by two weeks, ending Thursday. Spring break runs from Friday through Monday, and then the fourth quarter starts Tuesday, according to the HCPS webpage on coronavirus. Bulson pressed for taking action Tuesday, noting that “having some clarity around what target we’re trying to reach would make it easier for us to formulate a plan” for graduation. Other board members did not express support for postponing the vote. School counselors started, this week, “scouring” teachers’ records to determine which students are at risk of not graduating, according to the superintendent. “Waiving this [policy] would allow us to focus on those [students] at the greatest risk of not even meeting the minimum state requirement,” Bulson said. Board member Dr. Roy Phillips asked if school officials know how many seniors, countywide, are at risk of not graduating. Bulson said he “wouldn’t want to guess,” as counselors are still compiling that information. He noted that HCPS has a ratio of more than 300 students per counselor, “in some cases far more than that.” Michael O’Brien, executive director of secondary school instruction and performance, said school counselors and principals are putting together lists of which students need assistance with passing all courses required for graduation by the state, such as fourth-year English. Many schools design a “spring school” so seniors at risk of failing in the latter part of the year can take a class online and earn a “recovered credit” and graduate with their classmates, according to O’Brien. Administrators are considering options such as that as a “Plan B” so students who were at-risk when schools closed have an opportunity to pass all courses required by the state. Ensuring students can pass state-mandated courses is the “highest priority” for those administrators, according to O’Brien, who noted that most seniors are expected to meet Harford’s 26-credit graduation requirement. The policy waived by the school board would apply to courses required by HCPS that go beyond the 21 credits required by the state, such as a fourth-year math, a second semester of physical education and the “career pathway” for high schoolers, O’Brien said in response to a question by student representative Christian Walker. The graduation policy waiver, as well as the other waivers, were approved unanimously by the Harford board. ‘Heart is breaking’ for seniors Board members acknowledged the multiple concerns and questions they have heard from parents, students and community members about how the pandemic will affect the remainder of the school year, especially treasured activities for high school seniors such as prom and commencement. Vice President Rachel Gauthier thanked school system staff at all levels, including food service workers “doing just their level best” to ensure meals are prepared and distributed to as many families as possible, to custodians keeping buildings maintained, plus teachers, principals, school staff and HCPS central office leaders dealing with ever-changing news about the pandemic and adapting to the challenges of delivering instruction to students while school buildings are closed. She also thanked students for their patience and told seniors that “my heart is breaking for you” over the thought that they could miss their end-of-year ceremonies. “Please know that we’re aware, and we’re going to do what we can do while still trying to keep everybody safe,” Gauthier said.

Baltimore State’s Attorney Mosby to stop prosecuting drug possession, prostitution, other crimes amid coronavirus
.W
Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby ordered her staff Wednesday to dismiss pending criminal charges against anyone arrested for possessing drugs including heroin, attempted distribution of any drug, prostitution, trespassing, minor traffic offenses, open container and urinating in public. Mosby said she’s taking the action to reduce the threat of a coronavirus outbreak behind bars. These crimes pose no risk to public safety and the defendants would be released before trial in normal times, she wrote in a memo to prosecutors. “An outbreak in prison or jails could potentially be catastrophic,” she wrote. “Now is not the time for a piecemeal approach where we go into court and argue one one by one for the release of at-risk individuals." Many of those whose cases will be dropped are not currently in jail. In addition, Mosby sent a letter to Gov. Larry Hogan urging him to free all inmates over the age of 60 in state prisons, anyone approved for parole, and all prisoners scheduled to complete their sentences within the next year. She asked the governor to release them under supervision. “Jails and prisons cycle large numbers of people in and out of close, unsanitary quarters on a daily basis," Mosby wrote the governor. “If these facilities become breeding grounds for the coronavirus, it will not only impact those incarcerated, but our entire communities.” Gov. Larry Hogan could not be reached for comment and his staff said he would not be available for comment. The number of people infected with coronavirus continues to rise in Maryland. State health officials said Wednesday the state has at least 85 confirmed cases of the illness known as COVID-19. Mosby’s actions respond to a call from advocacy groups and public defenders to limit chances of the virus sweeping through Maryland’s jails and prisons. “We are grateful that our criminal justice partners recognized these concerns and collaborated to reduce the jail population and save the lives of our most vulnerable clients," wrote Kirsten Gettys Downs, the district public defender for Baltimore, in an email. “Ongoing detention during this public health crisis threatens the lives of our clients and creates conditions that will exacerbate the spread of this pandemic." Baltimore Police declined to comment. A department spokesman would not say whether officers will continue to arrest people on charges such as drug possession and prostitution. Mosby announced in January that she would stop prosecuting people for possessing marijuana regardless of the quantity. Last year, when she promised to end marijuana prosecutions, she cited research showing marijuana arrests disproportionately affect Baltimore’s African-American neighborhoods. Her new efforts would release anyone arrested for drug possession and attempted distribution, including for cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, during the viral outbreak. Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a researcher with the Sentencing Project, a prisoner right’s advocacy group in D.C., called Mosby’s announcement a “great start for sure” and said some jurisdictions are beginning to look further. She cited the Philadelphia Police Department no longer arresting people for nonviolent crimes such as auto theft, theft from persons and others. In Prince George’s County, prosecutors announced they were reviewing cases one-by-one and plan to release at least 40 people held on nonviolent offenses such as trespassing, misdemeanor theft and disorderly conduct. Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger said he was working with the county jail to identify nonviolent offenders for release. Ghandnoosh also echoed Mosby’s call for the release of prisoners who are close to completing their sentences. “It would run completely counterproductive to send someone to jail right now,” she said. Coronavirus cases have exploded in Chinese prisons, according to reports by the Associated Press. In Italy, prisoners rioted over strict measures to curtail the virus including a restriction on family visits, something Hogan has implemented in Maryland. And in Iran, 54,000 inmates were temporarily released due to fears of a prison outbreak. Some 2.3 million people are locked up in America’s prisons, local jails and juvenile detention centers, according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative. Of them, about 1.3 million are held in state correctional facilities like the 18 in Maryland. Still, Maryland’s prison population has fallen below 18,000 for the first time in nearly three decades. Prisoners are more likely to be elderly and suffer chronic illnesses than the general public, leaving them vulnerable to the virus. Health officials have long warned about rampant illness behind bars. The close quarters and limitations on washing hands and wiping surfaces heightens the risk. Maryland’s prisons alone hold more than 1,100 vulnerable inmates over the age of 60, Paul DeWolfe, Maryland’s top public defender, noted in a recent op-ed in The Baltimore Sun. For the elderly, he wrote, “incarceration during this public health crisis is akin to a death sentence." In her letter to Hogan, Mosby also urged the governor to close the courts except for emergency hearings. She has pushed back against Baltimore Circuit Court judges who decided to continue to hear guilty pleas. Such proceedings require the presence of defense attorneys, clerks and other courtroom staff — leaving her prosecutors at risk of infection, she said. On Tuesday, Mosby signed on with 30 prosecutors from around the country in urging local governments to take precautions. The prosecutors — including those from New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Francisco — called for police to stop jailing people who pose no risk to public safety. They also called for the release of prisoners held on charges of drug possession, and those locked up because they could not afford their cash bail. The prosecutors also called for the release of nonviolent prisoners who are elderly, chronically ill or six months from completing a sentence. These policies should remain even after the pandemic subsides, the attorneys wrote. “The United States is an international outlier in its rate of incarceration,” they wrote. “We put far too many people behind bars for far too long, and fail to provide adequate care to those we incarcerate. That’s a humanitarian crisis with or without COVID-19.” Reporter Cody Boteler contributed to this article.

Letters: We took much for granted, will reevaluate what’s important; Letter politicizing coronavirus inaccurate
.W
We took much for granted; will reevaluate what’s important My mother loved bread and butter in the morning and sadly, I never probed deeper into the reason why while I had the chance. Years later, the same craving has flowed into my DNA, especially during these days of limited movement and the general sadness around us. Every time I reach for the butter I think about the reasons for mom’s craving. Was it just a simple want or was it because her family couldn’t afford it? She grew up during the Depression. Was this a stronger desire on her part as an adult, because this simple pleasure was denied during childhood? Perhaps. Putting away the butter dish, I recollect the recent, sad events which have put Mount Airy at the center of attention: The sickness and deaths at a nearby nursing home and the unrelated but untimely deaths of three people in our quaint and unique town. Looking at the somewhat deserted street and recollecting how our daily routines have changed, a solitary conclusion emerges: We don’t miss someone or something until it or they are gone. Yes, we all probably took for granted the trips to the stores, just as the neighbor took for granted the teenager playing lacrosse in his yard next door. The trips will eventually return, the teenager will not. The teenager was my granddaughter’s classmate and they were planning a first date; she’s heartbroken. The recollection of the nursing home sign when I used to drive by was just that, a snapshot of the home for the elderly, the image quickly relegated to my mind’s background. That’s how we are and that was then. But now, I think about those folks, anticipating with a smile their reunion someday soon and with sadness for a young life that never reached its potential. Collectively, the human race had shown that it can recover from deep sadness and grief. We will come back wiser and stronger than before. What’s important and unique is how each one of us handles the sadness and the recovery today and every day. Each one of us, most without realizing it, will reevaluate what is important in this life and make the needed course corrections. Some of us will realize one’s views and political opinions expressed in this paper and other media, can be more effective without resorting to personal attacks or “guilty by association” broad brushing. These folks may be surprised to find out that we have a lot more in common with them than they realize. Some of us will put more passion and importance to the otherwise canned morning greeting to colleagues; it’s already happening where I work. For me, one of the things will be to hug my grandkids a little tighter next time I see them. And to walk away from the butter. Theodor Stathis Mount Airy Letter politicizing coronavirus inaccurate In response to David Iacono’s letter, “Lack of proactive response hurt America,” stating “Trump knew of the virus in December/January and did nothing to plan for upcoming pandemic.” The Trump administration announced quarantines and major travel restrictions from China on Jan. 31. This travel ban bought us time like the Spartans fighting the Persians at Thermopylae. What were Pelosi, Schiff, Schumer and the media doing in December/January? Impeaching President Trump for a telephone call, even though we had the transcript and no one could identify the crime. It also stated, “Trump abolished the office to address global pandemics.” Former National Security Council adviser Tim Morrison, the official who once ran the pandemic program, said the White House did not dissolve/eliminate the pandemic response office, it was merged with two other positions. Iacono blames President Trump for material shortages. According to Bloomberg News and the LA Times, the shortage of N95 respirators is because Obama/Biden used them for the H1N1 outbreak in 2009/10 and did not backfill the national stockpile. Before Bill Clinton became president, Congress would not grant China normal trade status, because of human rights violations. In 1993 Clinton signed executive order 12850 that helped China. In 2000, Clinton ended the annual congressional review of China’s trade status and signed the law that granted China, Permanent Normal Trade Relations and got China full participation in the World Trade Organization. They claimed this was in the interest of the United States and China would be a more responsible and accountable member of the global community. These were empty promises and cost millions of American jobs including over 90% of our pharmaceuticals manufactured in China and other countries. Now, because of the misguided liberal ideology of open borders and China becoming like us, we are dependent on China to help us fight the very pestilence they unleashed upon the world. With people’s lives disrupted and citizens dying, Iacono ends his letter echoing Hillary Clinton’s discussing “How is MAGA working out for you”? I’ll end with reality, not rhetoric. President Trump mentioned the coronavirus threat at the State of the Union address. Nancy Pelosi tore up his speech, ignoring the threat. Carl Burdette Westminster

Lots of violations of stay-at-home order but few arrests as Baltimore-area police adjust to coronavirus
.W
Maryland State Police charged a suspect who caused a crash in Baltimore County. Baltimore Police charged a beauty supply store owner after more than 20 people crowded into the shop. But when police in Howard County caught a group playing basketball, they decided not to file any charges. Police officers across the state have received hundreds of complaints asking them to enforce the governor’s executive orders to rein in the deadly coronavirus. But local police agencies around the Baltimore region say most people they encounter willingly disperse, and data shows that officers have issued few citations. On March 30, one of the more restrictive of Gov. Larry Hogan executive order’s limited residents from leaving home with the exception of “essential activities,” including going to work or to the grocery store or exercising. Violations carry a fine of up to $5,000 and up to one year in prison. Just before that order was announced, a Charles County man was charged with two counts of violating the emergency order after police said he hosted a bonfire party at his home. But that high-profile arrest is a rarity as several agencies said they try to encourage voluntary compliance before issuing charges. “We’re trying to use more of education and mitigation approach,” Baltimore County Police spokeswoman Sgt. Vickie Warehime said. "This is still our community, we still have to have good relationships” when the restrictions related to the virus are eased, she said. Warehime said a county task force has received 420 complaints since March 18th, when the state announced its first coronavirus death. Those complaints are forwarded to the appropriate agency, whether its police, the liquor board or another agency, but none have resulted in arrests, she said. “All calls were successfully resolved and to date no charges or arrests have been made,” she said. Previously, county officials have said cease and desist orders were issued to a gym and a barbershop on the east side of Baltimore County after they were found to be operating despite the order. Police have only charge two people in Baltimore, where the department has asked officers to give repeated warnings. Officers also have resorted to blaring a recording over police car sound systems telling residents: “Even if you aren’t showing symptoms, you could still have coronavirus and accidentally spread it to a relative or neighbor. Being home is being safe. We are all in this together.” Officers also are required to seek a supervisor’s permission before issuing charges. On April 1, officers were called to the “Super Beauty” supply store in the Mount Clare Junction shopping center in Southwest Baltimore where about 20 people were crowded into the shop, according to a police report. A plainclothes officer told the manager that the shop was not considered an essential business and the manager agreed to close the store. But about a week later, police received a second call about the store being full of shoppers, and the manager told officers he was instructed by the store’s owner, James Hwang to open. Officers issued a criminal citation against Hwang, charging him with four counts of violating the order. Hwang couldn’t be reached for comment Friday and didn’t have an attorney listed in online court records. Last week, police issued multiple warnings to a 19-year-old woman seen outside a vacant home in the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello neighborhood three different times. An officer issued a criminal citation after she was found not to be in the area for any essential reasons, but rather suspected of selling drugs. Meanwhile, Maryland State Police have charged at least seven people with violating orders, but all of the cases appear to be in connection with other charges, including the case of a Lutherville man charged with violating the governor’s executive order, along with 10 counts of allowing a minor to possess alcohol, after police said he hosted a party for teenagers at a Carroll County hotel. State Police Superintendent Colonel Woodrow Jones III previously directed troopers not to make traffic stops solely to determine whether the driver’s travel was essential. But officers can issue charges for violations of the order if that’s what they find out during the course of a routine traffic stop or crash investigation. When a trooper stopped a driver in Queen Anne’s County for a traffic stop, state police said the suspect dragged the trooper while attempting to flee. That person was charged with multiple criminal offenses, including violation of the order. Another person operating a pawn shop was in Queen Anne’s County was charged with violating the order after troopers were called multiple times to the shop. There are plenty of examples of violations being applied along with an initial criminal charge. Those include people charged with traffic violations, including a DUI in Cecil County, a person operating an unregistered motorcycle in Prince George’s County, and another person charged in a Baltimore County car crash. Similarly, police in Anne Arundel County said officers have charged five people with violating the order, but that the charges were “not the primary charge," police spokeswoman Sgt. Jacklyn Davis said. The department has responded to more than 400 calls related to violations. Davis said officers found no violation in 299 calls and issued warnings in the rest. “Everybody has been very, very understanding," Davis said. “We’ve been very lucky here.” A Harford County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson said two people have been charged with violating the governor’s orders, though those charges were in addition to other charges in both cases. In Howard County, police have responded to 23 incidents for large gatherings, including kids playing basketball, said department spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn. “In all of those cases, people dispersed voluntarily upon the officers’ requests,” she said.

With 227 confirmed cases and 162 social distancing complaints, Baltimore County executive announces coronavirus response fund
.W
Baltimore County has launched a COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund to support residents and governmental needs, even as the county has received 162 complaints related to social distancing infractions since the state and county announced social gatherings would be limited to 10 or fewer people, County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. announced Tuesday. Two cease-and-desist letters related to violations of the social-distancing mandate have been issued, to a gym in the 8300 block of Pulaski Highway and a barber shop in the 1800 block of Bel Air Road, according to Baltimore County Fire Department spokeswoman Elise Armacost. Olszewski said infractions were being handled by a task force of Baltimore County police, fire and health department personnel. The Office of the Fire Marshal has the authority to issue citations to certain businesses that are found violating county mandates on a complaint-driven basis, Armacost said. The response fund, managed by the Baltimore Community Foundation, is meant to aid those in the county “facing job loss, food insecurity and other challenges during this extraordinary time ... while boosting our ability to respond to this evolving crisis,” Olszewski said. Donations can be used to support myriad efforts, including buying groceries for seniors and food-insecure families and purchasing personal protective equipment for first responders and public health personnel. Individuals, foundations and private sector donors can contribute. County leadership will determine how funds are disbursed. “Unfortunately, the worst of our challenges are yet to come,” Olszewski said. “This is an all-hands-on-deck moment.” Contributions to the fund between $25 and $10,000 can be made online. Food insecure residents can also pick up grocery items at one of the county’s food distribution sites. “This fund meets a pressing need for Baltimore County and represents a model for cross-sector collaboration,” Shanaysha Sauls, president and chief executive officer of the Baltimore Community Foundation, said in a news release. Baltimore County also announced a virtual town hall on Thursday, April 2 and a budget hearing on Tuesday, April 7 at 6 p.m. Details for viewing the hearing will be available online, Olszewski said. “We already know we are seeing [increased] expenditures to ensure the safety of our residents,” Olszewski said. “There certainly is an economic impact to this.” “We are taking a very cautious approach" to store up contingency and reserve funding, Olszewski said. Olszewski said his administration was working with county hospitals to prepare for a surge. On Monday, Gov. Larry Hogan ordered Maryland residents to stay at home except for essential activities. Baltimore County has continued to ramp up its response to the coronavirus pandemic as the novel respiratory illness escalates in the U.S. In Maryland, 18 have died out of the 1,660 confirmed cases. Baltimore County has 227 confirmed cases as of Tuesday morning, according to the county Health Department. On Monday, Olszewski announced his administration would suspend issuing parking citations for the duration of the local state of emergency. Members of the public are also now barred from entering beyond the lobby of all Towson governmental buildings. Olszewksi had already closed the county’s senior and recreation centers and libraries and suspended water shutoffs. He’s also granted a 30-day extension to all county licenses, permits and registrations until after the local state of emergency is lifted and canceled or postponed all “non-essential” public meetings in order to encourage social distancing. More information about the county’s changes amid the pandemic can be viewed online. Residents with coronavirus-related questions or concerns can call the Baltimore County Department of Health at 410-887-3816 from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

With coronavirus battering economy, Ravens push back final payment date for season tickets
.W
The Ravens have moved their final payment date for season tickets from May 15 to June 15, the team announced Tuesday, joining other NFL teams that have relaxed deadlines amid the coronavirus pandemic. Accounts that were set to make automated monthly payments will not be charged in April, the team said in a release, and will instead be deferred to May and June. “We’re constantly monitoring the serious impact this public health crisis is having on our fans and community,” Ravens senior vice president of ticket sales and operations Baker Koppelman said in the release. “Priorities have shifted for many people, and rightfully so. We hope this adjustment offers some relief at a time when families and businesses are forced to deal with more pressing needs.” The spread of COVID-19, which has prompted lockdowns across the country and forced mass layoffs and business closures, could affect the Ravens’ 25th NFL season. Team president Dick Cass told the team website last week that offseason workouts were unlikely and that he’s “hopeful” teams will be cleared to return for training camp, in late July. Season-ticket holders can email ravens.ticketoffice@ravens.nfl.net or call 410-261-7283 and press 4 to leave a voicemail if they have any further questions.

Mount Airy approves budget amendment, talks changes in light of coronavirus, mourns recent deaths in community
.W
Beginning on a somber note to mourn two recent town tragedies, the Mount Airy Town Council approved a budget amendment necessitated by spending incurred through response to the coronavirus crisis and updated members of the community on changes brought about by the crisis at its April meeting. At the beginning of the council’s first virtual meeting, on Monday night, April 6, Mount Airy Town Council President Larry Hushour initiated a moment of silent for the lives lost in a recent shooting and at Pleasant View Nursing Home. Two were killed in the shooting, not including the alleged perpetrator who later killed himself, and 17 Pleasant View residents had died from a coronavirus outbreak in the facility as of Thursday. Hushour also asked the mayor and the rest of the council to “remember the first responders who answered the call and the doctor’s and nurses who are treating victims everyday.” Later in the meeting, Councilman Jason Poirier also encouraged people to participate in a future candlelight and/or ribbon vigil honoring the victims from last week’s shooting. However, Mayor Patrick Rockinberg said Thursday afternoon the vigil was canceled because of bad weather. Heather Zujkowski, 36, and Noah Homayouni, 18, were killed in the shooting. As of Thursday afternoon, a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign for Zujkowski had raised over $11,600 for a memorial and to help her three children, and another GoFundMe campaign had raised over $42,400 for Homayouni’s family. The council announced that it will introduce Mount Airy’s budget next month with a plan to vote on it in June, but an ordinance to make a budget amendment because of COVID-19 was brought up at the April meeting. The budget amendment adding $30,000 to the general fund passed unanimously. “It comes with a list of items on it, that are the expenses that either have occurred or will occur and a lot of it has to do with supplies and overtime and payroll and then there’s some other things that are on here as well,” said Hushour. Rockinberg detailed some of the expenses. “There’s personal protective equipment, there’s signage that we’ve put out again, masks, hand sanitizers, that alone is around $10,000. There was a decontamination machine in there for approximately $6,000 for the chief," he said. "So there’s a lot of things and if there’s probably about $4,000 left over that would be contingency and just to give you a heads-up, that’s gonna get us through the month.” During his report, Rockinberg spoke about the positives to be taken away from COVID-19 response during the stay-home order. “We are discovering small silver linings as we establish our new norm. Most of the clutter has been removed from our lives, scientists can actually hear seismic activities much more clearly, " said Rockinberg. “Our commutes have disappeared, or external duties have dissipated. We have all become closer to our families and we’ve all had more family time. "Looking for silver linings here, many have had time to cook. I’m personally going to put out a cookbook when this is over. We’re reading more, we’re meditating, we’re pausing to take in nature. ... In addition, we’ve seen town staff members of our emergency response team and elsewhere, perform services that they’ve never performed before before and they did it like pros. So proud of our staff and the council shows that pride.” According to Rockinberg, the parks remain open but only for exercise. City staff is monitoring the activity at the parks for potential closure if there is too much traffic. They have closed public buildings, playgrounds, playing courts and the dog park. In addition to Rockinberg, multiple members of the town council emphasized the importance of social distancing.

Police investigating report of people intentionally coughing on others in Mount Airy Safeway amid coronavirus
.W
Mount Airy police are investigating after people allegedly intentionally coughed on others at a grocery store Monday evening. According to a statement from the Mount Airy Police Department, the incident occurred between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. at the Safeway in the Mount Airy Shopping Center off Ridgeville Boulevard, though police were not notified until several hours later. It was reported to police that people were seen intentionally coughing and sneezing on others that were who were abiding by guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the statement. COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, is spread through droplets, such as those expelled in a cough or sneeze. Health and government officials are urging “social distancing” practices, such as remaining at least 6 feet from others, to limit spread. Police do not have suspects and have not made any arrests in the incident, according to Mount Airy Police Chief Douglass Reitz. If anyone involved in the incident fears that they might now be have the virus, Reitz advises them to speak with their private care provider to determine if they should go get tested. “Incidents of this nature will not be tolerated,” the department said in the statement. Beth Goldberg, senior manager of community and public affairs for Safeway Eastern division, referred questions about Monday’s incident to the Mount Airy police because it’s an ongoing investigation. The Mount Airy Police Department has not specified whether the people who were coughed on are customers or employees. According to Reitz, they are trying to identify those responsible through video surveillance footage, and they are working with the store and the people who made the complaint. This is the first time that an incident of this nature has been called in to Mount Airy police since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to Reitz. “This is something that we shouldn’t be doing; it’s kind of like the equivalent of going into a crowded movie theater and yelling ‘fire,’ ” Reitz said. “We don’t want to do that to instill fear, and basically it’s an assault on these people. What they’ve done is made them concerned and they’re in fear now that they may have possibly been contaminated by somebody even if it’s just an absurd prank, so to speak.” If anyone observed the incident or has information, police ask them to contact Detective Kelly at 301-703-1375 or at kelly@mountairymd.gov.

South Carroll Dog Park holds soft opening ahead of widespread closures related to coronavirus
.W
The South Carroll Dog Park, which has been in the works for about four years, opened on a limited basis to guests March 16. A “soft opening” was held that day for the park, which is behind the South Carroll Senior and Community Center at 5928 Mineral Hill Road, soon before closures and event cancellations became widespread out of concern over the coronavirus. In response to that virus — also known as the disease it causes, COVID-19 — the state government has since prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people and ordered nonessential businesses to close. Kathy Martin, lead volunteer of the Friends of South Carroll Dog Park group, said before the soft opening that she believed the open space would allow the limited number of attendees to remain at least 6 feet apart from one another. That’s a “social distancing” recommendation from health professionals and state officials. Looking forward, a grand opening is scheduled for April 26. Martin said the soft opening provided “an opportunity for us to make sure our codes work, make sure the gate opens, let the dogs get acquainted. The space between the soft opening and the grand opening will include some down times because things are still being installed. For example, we’re in the middle of considering how we’re going to get a shed.” People can now start registering, which is required for dogs to use the park, Martin said. Each household can register two dogs for $30 for the year and each additional dog is another $5. Martin said people who register can start using the park, but there will be some days between March 16 and April 16 that the park will be closed for installations. Further information, such as park rules, pricing and the membership form can be found at the Carroll County’s parks and recreation website at https://www.carrollcountymd.gov/government/directory/recreation-parks/places-to-go/south-carroll-dog-park/.

Tale of two leaders: One outlines coronavirus preparations, the other shrugs off the danger | COMMENTARY
.W
This past week, Gov. Larry Hogan demonstrated how to comfort people worried about the threat of a global pandemic. In a Thursday afternoon news conference at the Maryland Emergency Management Agency in Reisterstown, Governor Hogan calmly revealed that there are suspected cases now in Maryland (although none has yet tested positive), and that he was meeting daily with health officials, his cabinet and others to monitor the situation. He said that while the risk to Maryland was generally regarded as low, his cabinet was preparing for the worst and that could mean everything from school closings to the cancellation of mass gatherings. “Our state is taking every precaution when it comes to the coronavirus,” the governor told reporters. Now, compare that to President Donald Trump’s rambling midweek news conference on the subject one day earlier during which he attempted to soft-pedal the outbreak and the risk posed to this country. It was an unconvincing denial given that he contradicted the federal government’s actual experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As early as Tuesday, top doctors said that it’s “inevitable” that the virus will spread within the United States. That Mr. Trump also chose to appoint Vice President Mike Pence to lead the government’s response to coronavirus surely didn’t help the administration’s already-strained credibility. Mr. Pence’s so-called “talent” for public health includes his widely-panned response to an Indiana HIV outbreak when he was governor. Governor Hogan knows what people want to hear in an emergency. President Trump, in contrast, sees the same circumstances only through the prism of political self-interest. Attacks by Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the administration’s slow reaction to the coronavirus outbreak and the recent tumble of the stock markets is his chief concern, not emergency preparedness. How do we know this? We can read Twitter. “Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible. Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape!” the denier-in-chief wrote Wednesday. We hope the coronavirus doesn’t continue to spread and turn into a global pandemic. But what’s especially scary is to imagine that this president is calling the shots when it comes to public health. President Trump lies. He lies about big things and small things. His false or misleading statement count in office is somewhere north of 16,241, according to The Washington Post. This is exactly the wrong person to be talking to anyone about a deadly outbreak. The government’s credibility is critically important. Please, Mr. President, step aside and let the real experts take the lead. Just about any soul in the deepest of the deep state offices of the CDC or NIH would be more trustworthy and more confidence-building right now. This isn’t a Democratic versus Republican thing (or a governor versus president, for that matter), it’s an Americans-need-an-expert thing. The coronavirus can’t be wiped out by calling it a name. What Americans have a right to expect is to know the White House is preparing for the worst, too. Just ask Governor Hogan and his staff, who are taking pains not only to stay in touch with the CDC but to brief legislators and local health officials on exactly what they know. People don’t want salesmanship, they want to see salt trucks lined up on the highway when there’s even a modest forecast of snow. Small wonder that Wall Street, after witnessing Wednesday’s presidential soft-pedal, went back to work Thursday thoroughly unconvinced. As a result, U.S. and foreign stock prices took another nose dive, continuing the worst streak since the Great Recession, and it continued on through Friday. CNN didn’t cause that. This isn’t a messaging problem, it’s a legitimate health threat. And when there’s a potential medical emergency, you want the unvarnished truth. That’s what Mr. Hogan delivered. That’s what all Americans have a right to expect.

Baltimore Mayor Young closes more roads around Lake Montebello to promote exercise during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced Monday that more roads around Lake Montebello in the northeastern section of the city will be closed effective immediately to allow residents to walk and bike safely while adhering to the 6-foot social distancing recommendation in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. “This pilot program expands people’s walking and biking options while helping residents get some much-needed fresh air in an appropriate space,” Mayor Young said in a written statement. “I have tasked the Department of Transportation with finding solutions to allow our residents ways of practicing social distancing in a safe environment.” Del. Robbyn Lewis, a Democrat who represents Southeast Baltimore’s District 46 and a self-described transit and mobility activist, applauded the mayor’s announcement. “This decision shows a willingness to adapt to conditions on the ground and address the mental and physical health needs of the people of this city,” she said. “It shows a willingness to put people’s well-being first, and I hope it’s a signal that similar actions can be taken for other communities. I hope it’s the first and not the last such effort.” All roads, including Whitman and Curran drives, around Lake Montebello will be closed to all drivers, and there will be no vehicular access to Lake Montebello Drive. The park entrances at Whitman and Lake Montebello drives will be closed, and the entrance at Chesterfield Avenue may be closed depending on construction. Motorists will be directed to a detour using E. 32nd Street and Harford Road. Residential streets next to Lake Montebello will be limited to local access only. According to German Vigil, a spokesman for the Baltimore City Department of Transportation, Whitman Drive had been closed to traffic in mid-March, but motorists were permitted to use Curran Drive on the eastern side of the lake. Last month, Steve Sharkey, director of the Baltimore City Department of Transportation, had said there were no plans to close streets in the city. But in the same statement issued by Young’s office Monday, Sharkey acknowledged that the advent of warmer temperatures spurred the decision to open streets to residents and shut them down to motorists. “As the weather continues to change, DOT is taking action to help maintain and protect the health of our residents,” he said. “This new addition to our pilot program creates more options and opportunities for our residents to exercise as the city works to maintain and protect the health of our residents.” Asked about the change in stance, Vigil said in an email that officials took time to collect data and community input to assess how such a “Slow Street Program” might be implemented in Baltimore. “After reviewing this data and feedback,” Vigil wrote, "Director Sharkey and his team were able to identify a few locations in city parks to pilot this program and assess its impact.” The move is part of a growing nationwide movement to shut off several miles of roads and lanes to allow city residents to get outside and burn off calories and stress caused by being restricted to their homes as political and medical leaders try to stem the COVID-19 tide. Jurisdictions like Denver, Minneapolis and Oakland have closed off several miles of their streets to create more open space for their residents. Keshia M. Pollack Porter, the associate dean for faculty and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who specializes in transportation and health, said the benefits of outdoor access for city residents are plentiful. “We know that physical activity can help to reduce stress, promote mental health in addition to physical health and how people in cities are really constrained in being able to be outside, get fresh air, get exercise, and be six feet apart,” said Pollack Porter, who wrote an opinion piece proposing similar measures that was published April 28 in The Sun. “So it’s great to see that the city has moved in this direction, and I hope it’s the beginning of more and that the effort to sustain goes beyond the pandemic.” Pollack Porter said closing roads in cities can mean more residents walking into local businesses and spending money there. “We’ve seen other places with open streets allow more foot traffic to go in front of businesses, allowing people more access to connect with street vendors that they might not otherwise,” she said. “We also know that there’s benefits for social integration, and it allows them to experience their communities in a way that they wouldn’t otherwise.” But city officials continued to emphasize the need to practice the 6-foot distancing guideline to prevent further infection. “While we have always welcomed walkers and bicyclists to enjoy Lake Montebello, we must practice social distancing and respect the neighborhood,” Acting Department of Public Works Director Matthew Garbark said. “We are excited to partner with the Department of Transportation on the expansion of their Slow Streets Pilot Program which promotes social distancing in a responsible way.” The closures around Lake Montebello follow a similar program in Druid Hill Park in which the city closed a lane of parking on Swan Drive where it intersected with Beechwood Drive on the western side of Druid Lake and ran along Swan and East drives before ending at the intersection of East Drive and Red Road near the park’s tennis courts. While the closures around Lake Montebello and Druid Lake are positive steps, Lewis, the Maryland delegate, cited Winston Churchill’s quote “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” “I hope this is like the first drop on the stone and that we just wear away at the predominance and pervasive ubiquity of cars in our city,” she said. “Around the world, people are finding that their air quality has improved because people are driving less. I hope we can see some of that. … I think the fact that the mayor has seen the light means that the time is right, and I really hope that our communities who are hungry for safe and open space, I hope that hunger is going to be satisfied for all communities soon.”

Northwest Baltimore so far hardest hit by coronavirus as Maryland adds 531 new cases, 235 total deaths
.W
Maryland health officials are now reporting confirmed coronavirus cases by ZIP code as the state confirmed 531 new patients since Saturday, with 235 total deaths resulting from the virus. By ZIP code, Northwest Baltimore showed the highest singular concentration of cases with 137, officials said. The data reflects information released by the Baltimore City Health Department last week, which showed a high concentration of cases in the Arlington neighborhood and smaller pockets in other parts of North Baltimore. Kata Hall, spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan, wrote that the state is now up to 8,225 cases overall, with a high concentration in Silver Spring in Montgomery County. At least 125 cases were confirmed in the 20902, 20906 and 20904 ZIP codes, all within the Silver Spring area, for a combined 383 cases. Prince George’s and Montgomery counties continue to lead all other Maryland counties in overall cases, with 2,035 cases and 1,631 cases, respectively. Baltimore has the fourth-highest number of cases among all of Maryland’s counties and municipalities, with 812 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Hall also wrote that the confirmed cases continue to stay disproportionately black, as 2,988 of the confirmed cases were from African-American residents, the most cases among any single race in the state, despite not being the majority population. The state still has incomplete racial demographic data, as the health department could not provide the information for 1,578 cases throughout the state, including 27 fatal infections. Hall wrote that 1,860 people have been hospitalized due to the disease and that 456 have since been released from isolation. Hogan wrote on Twitter the decision to release ZIP code specific data was made “so that Marylanders can better understand the spread of this deadly virus.” This story will be updated.

Churches in Harford County grapple with coronavirus, turn to technology for services
.W
Delivering Mass to an empty church has been an adjustment for priests at St. Margaret Parish in Bel Air. But their lessons do not fall on deaf ears — nor do the services of other religious leaders around Harford County who now have to employ streaming and video recording to get the word out — especially as Easter approaches. "It has been pretty odd for the priests to be doing the Mass without any people there,” said Kathy Reilly, public relations associate for St. Margaret’s, but the church community has been very appreciative of the steps taken, she added. The Rev. Lynne Humphries-Russ of Hopewell United Methodist and Wesleyan Chapel United Methodist churches in Havre de Grace and Aberdeen, respectfully, said the change has been jarring, but ultimately for the benefit of the two churches where she conducts services. She plans to hold a digital Easter service for congregants. “It has been truly like flying a plane and building it at the same time,” she said. “Our mantra is ‘We have never done that before, but we are willing to try it.’” She and other Harford County religious leaders had been ruminating on taking their services to the internet. The idea simmered, but never became a priority, Humphries-Russ said, until the coronavirus forced congregants to stay home, emptying pews across the state. Since the churches closed for services by order of Gov. Larry Hogan, she has taken her services to YouTube, where, with the help of her husband, she has managed to stitch together services complete with a recorded organist playing. It has been successful, she said. “It is moving everything in an analog place into this digital place, and it is a true paradigm shift,” she said. “There are more people who are viewing us on YouTube than come to the two churches combined." And beyond the services, faith groups and classes are still convening via Zoom, a video-conferencing application, as are Sunday school classes and meetings of all kinds. She is even working on recording a choir performing over the application. Those recordings, she said, can stave off loneliness and depression for members of her congregation, whose daily lives and routines have been disrupted by the virus. Some are disconsolate because they cannot see their friends at church; one has a husband in a COVID-19 ward, Humphries-Russ said. “If we don’t have this hope, this light to look toward, I do not know how [we] could survive,” she said. Though the congregation at St. Margaret’s is heartened by the virtual Masses, Reilly said the sense of community they built seeing each other at Mass has been disrupted, though many have been keeping in contact with others through the pandemic. “On every weekday morning at 6:30 and 8:30 we have Mass ... The people that come to those Masses, they are here every single day,” she said. "The contact with people is not there. People are missing each other.” The priests have been calling parishioners to stay connected with them, but the crisis has thrown the need for churches to use technology into sharp relief, Reilly said. “We’re learning how to be a part of a world right now that is so technology-oriented,” she said. “It is making everybody step up and be a part of that… that part of it is a good thing.” St. Margaret will hold a digital Mass for Easter, Reilly said. The Rev. María McCabe of Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Harford County in Churchville said the church has held three services on Zoom in response to church closures. She estimated that the last worship service attracted approximately 120 people. “In that instance, it was a little bit higher than the general attendance,” McCabe said. “This is still a pretty new world for us ... We are finding that using a virtual platform gives folks who are ill or have different kinds of accessibility issues an opportunity to participate.” The pivot to technological services, she said, is a necessary conversation. Many larger faith communities have been broadcasting their services on the internet, but now the coronavirus has forced her and others around the county to take the leap as well. The church’s community, she said, has pulled together during the pandemic, which has not fractured the community. Still, the video services are making the best of a bad situation. "That is not to say there is not suffering, but at least our efforts are to make sure everyone is included in active connections,” McCabe said. “It is hard, especially for folks who live alone.” Havre de Grace United Methodist Church has been live streaming its worship services, and has also been reaching out to its members in other ways, including wellness check-in phone calls, texting or calling children and sending cards to homebound members, Pastor Norman Obenshain said. Bishop LaTrelle Easterling, the episcopal leader of the Baltimore-Washington Conference of The United Methodist Church, will offer a conference-wide Easter service, Obenshain said. The Havre de Grace church may offer its own live-streamed service for the holiday as well. “Unless Gov. Hogan, led by expert medical opinion, lifts the current restrictions we will not gather. Out of love for each other, in order to help folk maintain health, we will keep our physical distance even while working to maintain social connection,” Obenshain said. He’s optimistic about what the future holds. “Easter reminds us that the present is not the end of the story. We will rise again from this pandemic crisis to new life and a new future,” Obenshain said. Aegis reporter Randy McRoberts contributed to this article.

Community Voices (Scanlan): Will generation’s defining moment be coronavirus or our response to it?
.W
Every generation has its defining events and touchstones. For my parents’ generation it was the Great Depression. My mother never stopped saving just about everything that might be useful in the future. Plastic containers and glass jars were used to store leftovers, safety pins, just about anything “too good” to throw away. Being frugal was so deeply ingrained in that generation, it never disappeared. Every person of that era could tell you exactly where they were and what they were doing when they learned of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The Greatest Generation rallied together to win World War II, and they shaped modern America for years to come. The Baby Boomers have a different set of milestones. I was in third grade when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. That memory is as indelible as any event in my life. It also was a harbinger of the turmoil our nation would undergo for the next decade. The assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, only two months apart, seared our national consciousness, dashing the hopes of a brighter future for millions of Americans. Riots in cities across the country exacerbated racial tensions. The Vietnam War did not unite us, but bitterly divided an already fractured society. The anti-war movement defined a generation of young people much like the Depression and WWII defined those who came before us. Not all events have been divisive. Americans watched in awe as man landed on the moon for the first time. The fall of the Berlin Wall proved that freedom and liberty were more than American values; they resonated worldwide. The attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001 brought us together through our grieving and demonstrated our resilience as a nation. As with the Kennedy assassination, there is a generation of people who can tell you exactly what they were doing when they heard about the 9/11 attack. I was standing in front of a class at North Carroll High School. As the years went by, eventually I had students who were too young to remember. September 11th was simply an event in history they had learned about, not a milestone memory. I wonder what events will define today’s collective consciousness? Will it be the election of Barack Obama? Will it be the election of Donald Trump? Will it be our current COVID-19 pandemic? It seems hard to imagine that the coronavirus emergency will become a generational touchstone. There has been no dramatic single moment that might become embedded in our psyches, no unifying element to bring us together. On the other hand, this pandemic is probably the most consequential event in many years. Schools in Maryland will be closed for at least two months. Educators and students alike are struggling through the realities of distance learning. Businesses have been shuttered, and wearing face masks in public is now the norm. Some 60,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Yet, we have reactionaries still trying to pretend it is all a hoax designed to damage the Trump presidency. Perhaps even more ludicrous is the claim that public safety measures are an attack on our Constitutional freedoms. Don’t we have enough to worry about without being bombarded with disinformation and phony “cures” that endanger lives? Despite the hardships and challenges we are enduring, there are some positives that give us hope for our society. Shelter in place orders have resulted in significant reductions in air pollution according to National Geographic and NASA. Many of us have seen the photos of goats roaming a village in Wales, and wildlife has made resurgences in other areas, too. Crime is down. Families are spending more time actually doing things together. Kids have more unstructured time to create and explore. In Carroll County, folks are going out of their way to support one another. Carroll Food Sunday has teamed up with Grace Lutheran to provide food to needy neighbors. Similarly, Old Westminster Winery is collecting food which is then distributed by Crossroads Community Center. Citizens in our community are making facemasks to give to those who need them. Perhaps these small gestures, these quiet improvements to our world, may be the defining moment of our time. Maybe it is not too late for us to come together as a people. But remember, you still need to wear pants when you go to the mailbox. I guess some things will never change. Tom Scanlan writes from Westminster. Reach him at trscanlan@gmail.com.

Beloved Baltimore youth rec basketball coach Kevin Dotson dies of the coronavirus
.W
Cecil Kirk recreation basketball coach Kevin Dotson, a fixture on the Baltimore City basketball scene, died Sunday due to complications caused by the coronavirus. He was 44. Dotson’s father, Calvin Dotson Jr., a legendary coach at Cecil Kirk for more than 30 years, said his son dealt with underlying conditions, including asthma and high blood pressure. After spending time coaching at Shutdown Academy, Kevin Dotson, who played for and graduated from Randallstown High School, spent the past four years coaching at Cecil Kirk, where he spent many of his childhood days. He first tagged along with his father as a toddler and then played and was part of championship teams in the program. Cecil Kirk, an East Baltimore rec center under longtime director Anthony Lewis, has been a basketball pipeline for generations, producing a number of standout players who had successful high school, college and professional careers, including NBA players such as Rudy Gay, Juan Dixon, Reggie Lewis and David Wingate. Kevin Dotson developed a thirst for basketball and shared it with everybody that was around him. “Kevin had a good heart and he loved basketball, had a passion about it,” said his father. "One year, I had him coaching with me and he would always say, ‘Daddy, do this!' He had a great mind for basketball and never forgot anything. He was just a genuinely nice person and he worked hard at his craft. He’d text me, ‘Daddy, I’m working hard in the box — we’re getting it done. I’d say ‘All right, son.’ ” Dotson’s younger brother, Calvin III, 37, who is an assistant basketball coach at Gilman, said his brother was a mentor who proved an ideal role model. There were car rides to and from high school by his brother, endless games of 1-on-1 wherever the two could find lighted outdoor courts and an example that was provided that began with hard work. “Kevin always supported me in anything I wanted to do — he just wanted me to work hard,” Calvin Dotson III said. “He had an impact on so many people for so many years, even before he started coaching he had always been recognized a staple in the basketball community.” Dotson III recalls his brother’s shining moment while playing at Randallstown when he excelled against Baltimore County rival Woodlawn. “He hit three or four [3-point shots] and he’s like high-stepping down the court and pointing at the crowd. It was the funniest thing,” he said. “That’s probably the best memory for anybody that knows him. All his friends know this — that was his moment.” When Lake Clifton and Miami standout Kevin Norris first played organized basketball when he was 8 years old, Kevin Dotson was by his side as a teammate. Their friendship grew with their shared passion for coaching. “You have a lot of selfish people in this world and Kevin was really selfless,” said Mr. Norris, who is an assistant men’s basketball coach at University of Central Florida. “He grew up watching his dad and coach Anthony Lewis and you know the old saying ‘The apple don’t fall too far from the tree.’ He got it from his dad. When he stopped playing the game, he gave all his time to the kids and he went above and beyond for them. From taking them to school, to picking them up to take them to practice and after practice taking them home. You name it, he was doing it.” Kevin Dotson was a regular in Baltimore City high school gyms when big games were played — always there early to watch the junior varsity games ahead of the varsity. Many players on the Lake Clifton team come through the Cecil Kirk program. Quinton Monroe, who started on the Lakers junior varsity team as a freshman this past season, said Kevin Dotson immediately became more than just a coach to him back in seventh grade. “He was a good person, a good coach,” the player said. “He would pick me up to take me to watch basketball — was more than just a basketball coach. He talked to me about other stuff, asking me how things were going and to keep the stuff up in school and things like that, so it was more than basketball. It’s going to be tough.” Kevin Dotson is survived by his father, his brother and an extended family. His mother, Sandy, died April 25, 2014, shortly before he returned to Cecil Kirk to coach. His brother said his return to Cecil Kirk was vital and a blessing while he grieved his loss. A memorial service will be planned at a later date after social-distancing restrictions have been lifted.

Maryland’s GOP chair is picking up the tab to help businesses during coronavirus downturn
.W
Maryland Republican Party chairman Dirk Haire and his wife Anne Arundel County Councilwoman Jessica Haire are sponsoring $10,000 worth of free food from local restaurants and caterers to bolster those businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak, the party announced Tuesday. The free food, which is available to the public on a first come, first served basis, will be offered at Anne Arundel County businesses starting Wednesday. The first 40 people who contact Skipper’s Pier restaurant in Deale on Wednesday and ask for “dinner on Jessica and Dirk” will receive $25 off of their order, according to a news release from the state party. On Thursday, the first 40 people who contact Glory Days Grill in Edgewater and ask for the same deal will receive $25 off of their order, the party said. On Friday, the Haires will buy dinner for Anne Arundel County police stationed in the southern district, provided by Julie St. Marie Catering of Annapolis. Additional offers for other businesses in Anne Arundel County will be announced in the next few days, Dirk Haire said Tuesday. The couple plan to post the offers on Jessica Haire’s Facebook page. Maryland had at least 349 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Tuesday, and four people have died in the state as a result of the virus. An order from Gov. Larry Hogan required all nonessential businesses to close as of Monday, strengthening a previous order that forced all restaurants and bars to close to dine-in customers last week. Takeout and delivery remain legal, however many restaurants have been forced to lay off staff or reduce hours due to lack of demand.

Bel Air family starts ‘The Hero Masks Project’ to get protective supplies to people working during coronavirus pandemic
.W
A Bel Air couple has started The Hero Masks Project, an initiative to raise money to purchase and deliver protective gear to those working on the front lines of the novel coronavirus pandemic, and ultimately, the public at large. “Everybody who is considered an essential worker that has contact with the public should have protection so that they don’t get infected, and they should also have protection, so that if they are infected, they don’t infect the public,” Brian Gallagher said. He and his wife, Natalie, launched the project late last week. They used their own funds to purchase masks and gloves from manufacturers based overseas, had them shipped to Harford County by air, and have started providing them to local entities. The supplies are either sold to the recipients “at cost” or donated, according to Brian Gallagher. He dropped a package of masks and gloves at Key Point Health Services in Aberdeen last Friday to support Key Point staffers working with clients in the community — those supplies were sold to the agency at cost. “For organizations who have a purchasing budget to procure what they need, we prefer to sell at cost to them, as we can then put their funds back into resupply for the next round,” he explained. The Gallaghers want to donate supplies to organizations in need but might not have the funds to make a purchase, such as operators of a homeless shelter. He stressed that he and his wife are not operating a nonprofit entity, but the project is a “zero-profit” initiative. The Gallaghers received state approval of their articles of organization March 31, meaning they have a “legal business entity,” Hero Masks LLC. That gives them an entity to accept donations, open business bank accounts, seek lines of credit, even provide legal protection, according to Brian. Health care workers around the country have struggled to keep themselves supplied with personal protective equipment, or PPE, as they work to handle a COVID-19 caseload that increases by the day, leaving workers short of gear such as masks, gloves, gowns and eye protection. While many people who contract the respiratory disease do recover, it has been fatal for other patients, especially those with underlying health conditions. There is no vaccine and no approved treatment for COVID-19 as of now. Many states, including Maryland, have enacted strict measures to curtail social interaction and slow the spread of the disease. People are still able to go to work, though, and the Gallaghers are working to secure protective gear for workers who have regular interaction with the public, such as health care workers, supermarket employees or food delivery drivers. “One of the biggest challenges now is, the supply chain is just getting so overloaded,” said Brian, who noted prices of PPE supplies have increased along with demand during the global coronavirus pandemic. “Time is of the essence before other countries start going the way of Spain and Italy,” and demand for protective gear for other nations goes up, according to Brian. Medical supply companies in the U.S. are struggling to keep up with demand for PPE, as well as major retailers such as Amazon. Brian noted that it has been more efficient to acquire supplies from manufacturers based overseas in countries such as China, and have them shipped by air. People can support The Hero Masks Project by visiting the project website, www.heromasks.org and donating. The more money people donate, the easier it is for the Gallaghers to purchase large orders of 50,000 to 100,000 units at minimum, which is typically required by the overseas manufacturers and supplies, according to the website. People also can visit the website for more information on volunteering, providing sponsorships and filing requests for supplies. “I feel like people want to help but they don’t know how to help [during the pandemic], and this is one way they can help by getting involved, [supporting] this project,” Natalie Gallagher said. Brian said his father completed radiation treatment for cancer around the same time news coverage of coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, started earlier this year. The virus “sounded like a big concern,” and he wanted to ensure his father, who is living with Brian’s brother’s family in Bel Air, and his relatives had sufficient protective gear while his father was recovering. The masks project started as a way for the Gallaghers and their two younger children, ages 5 and 8, to support the workers who have been delivering food to their house as restaurants have closed to dine-in customers and schools have been closed since mid-March. The family has supplied packages of gloves, masks and disinfecting wipes to the Buontempo Bros. pizza restaurant in downtown Bel Air as well as the Domino’s off of North Main Street for the drivers “that are keeping us well fed,” Brian said. He noted Thursday that he and his wife had purchased 10,000 face masks and 3,000 face shields. “Hopefully, we’ll get donations in to help cover those costs and then some, so we can get even more [supplies],” Brian wrote in a text message. “Unfortunately, time isn’t just money anymore,” he added. “Time is lives when it comes to getting this PPE in and into the hands of people that need it.” Masks for the public Earlier in the pandemic, medical and government officials encouraged people in the U.S. to avoid wearing face masks when out in public unless they were sick, in order to conserve supplies for medical workers. Officials also noted that wearing a mask when sick helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 by catching infected droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, but they are not sufficient to protect healthy people from the virus. Those views are starting to change, though, amid media reports that the wearing of masks in public has lessened the spread in a number of Asian countries, where it was common for people to wear masks when out even before the pandemic, and some European countries such as Austria and the Czech Republic are requiring their citizens to wear masks when visiting places such as supermarkets. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking into a recommendation that Americans do the same, The Washington Post reported earlier this week. “I think that’s compelling,” Natalie said of recent reports about mask wearing. Natalie, who was born and raised in South Africa, recalled when she was flying back to the U.S. after visiting family in England during January, and being in Heathrow Airport and seeing Asian travelers wearing face masks. European travelers did not have their faces covered, though, and the sight “triggered a lot of the anxiety” that many people in Europe and the U.S. now feel about coronavirus. The Gallaghers hope to obtain enough supplies so they can give them out to the general public, potentially on a drive-through basis, in exchange for donations. “The more people who wear masks, the more protection there is and the less risk of transmission there is,” Natalie said.

Maryland reports deadliest single-day coronavirus toll with 68 new victims; Hogan not yet ready to begin state’s reopening
.W
Maryland saw a single-day high in new deaths related to the coronavirus Tuesday as Gov. Larry Hogan pointed to the growing case count as evidence the state is not ready to reopen. State officials announced 68 new confirmed deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, bringing the state to at least 584 killed by the virus. They attribute another 68 probable deaths to the virus, likely caused by the infection but not confirmed by a laboratory test. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state rose to at least 14,193, as Maryland announced 509 new positive tests. And those numbers are likely to spike as the state rolls out 500,000 tests acquired from South Korea — a significant increase in its testing capabilities. As of Tuesday, Maryland has reported results for fewer than 74,000 tests, with more than 80% coming back negative. Hogan, during a series of national news program appearances Tuesday morning, said the national capital region as a whole, including D.C. and VIrginia, has surpassed 25,000 confirmed cases and 1,000 virus-related deaths. “Today is a tough day,” Hogan said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”. "These 500,000 tests are going to help us save the lives of thousands of people.” Expanded testing capability is one of four pillars of Hogan’s plan to eventually reopen the state. But even as other Republican governors have started motions to reopen, Hogan said Maryland is not quite at that stage. Hogan said he is not considering the wide-ranging opening of business that the governors of Georgia and Tennessee are implementing as soon as the end of this week, though he said he “can’t speak to exactly what the situation is in their states.” “We’re going to open up our state as soon as we can because I want to get people back to work. I want our small businesses back open again,” Hogan said. "But we’re not gonna do it at a time when it’s gonna be endangering lives.” Despite criticism from President Donald Trump over the acquisition of the South Korean tests, Hogan repeatedly pointed to the president’s recommendation of not beginning to reopen a state until its count of new cases decreases for 14 straight days. Maryland’s longest such stretch to this point is three consecutive days. “In our region, because of all the distancing we put in place — we were one of the first, most aggressive, earliest-acting states — our numbers are behind everybody else,” Hogan said on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.” "We’ve flattened the curve, we’ve lengthened the curve, but now, we’re starting to go up. "Under the president’s own plan, we can’t open yet. But we’ve been working on a reopening plan for several weeks now. ... I’m anxious to get us open as soon as we can possibly do it in a safe way.” Hogan also questioned Trump’s support of nationwide protests, including one in Annapolis, to reopen the economy despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the virus. “I think it’s unhelpful," Hogan said on ABC’s “The View.” "It doesn’t make any sense, the mixed messaging we’re getting out of the president... "I feel like protesting myself frankly, but I think to encourage people to go out against your own policy, I don’t think it’s helpful to the discussion.” Increasing hospitals’ surge capacity is another part of Hogan’s plan, which he said he would detail later this week. On Tuesday, Maryland began reporting its current hospitalizations from the virus; previously, only the overall count of hospitalizations during the pandemic was available. There are 1,433 patients currently hospitalized, with 526 in intensive care. Maryland has reported 3,158 total hospitalizations total caused by the virus, meaning about 55% who have been hospitalized are no longer — though it’s unclear how many of them have died. The state also reported that 930 people total have been released from isolation to date. Almost 72% of people who have died from COVID-19 have been at least 60 years old, though that group — considered the most at-risk to the virus’ effects — accounts for less than a third of Maryland’s confirmed cases. About 45% of the victims and of the infected, among those whose race is known, are black, while African Americans make up 30% of Maryland’s overall population, according to U.S. Census data. The state is not reporting race in about a fifth of its cases. Hogan said on “The View” that he empathizes with those protesting and those who want to return to work, but as Maryland’s case and death counts continue to rise, he must also focus on the ongoing health crisis. “Everybody’s gonna try to get our economy back on track, but I understand and empathize,” Hogan said. “I feel really badly for the people that are out there suffering. I also feel terrible about the people who have lost their lives and all the people that are sick. We’re trying to fix both problems at the same time.”

Here’s how to help Baltimore small businesses struggling financially because of coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced life as we know it to a halt in Baltimore and across the country. As only essential business operations continue and many companies must shift to work remotely, our favorite restaurants, music venues, barber shops, nail salons and other local businesses have been ordered to close. Though these closures are meant to be temporary, many businesses will be forced to shutter permanently, unable to weather the economic impact of COVID-19. Baltimore is a city whose economy relies heavily on small businesses, especially family-owned, as well as minority and women-owned businesses. As a proud native Baltimorean and longtime Baltimore business owner, I understand and recognize that our small businesses are the lifeblood of our city. Now, more than ever, Baltimore City’s leaders need to recognize the value of small businesses and lift them up during these challenging times. There are several initiatives Baltimore leaders must implement to help small businesses survive this crisis. City leaders must recognize the severity of the impact this virus is having on our business community and act immediately to help. Most small businesses are not flush with liquidity to keep them afloat for more than a month without incoming cash flow. If a business runs out of cash during this time, it will be forced to close its doors. The old adage that “cash is king” is especially true for our local entrepreneurs. As a business owner in Baltimore City, I know first-hand the challenges vendors face in being paid on time for various projects and contracts with the city. Our leaders need to take immediate action to protect our small businesses. This can be accomplished by having the city of Baltimore commit to consistently pay its vendors on time. Mayor Jack Young should mandate that the city pay all its outstanding invoices to its local vendors within the next seven days. Going forward, the mayor should make a commitment that the city will pay local vendors within 15 to 30 days. This is an easy, obvious step the city can take to help provide a direct flow of funds to small businesses with city contracts, especially at a time when other sources of income may be drying up. City leaders should also immediately create what I call ‘entrepreneurship support SWAT teams,’ or teams of professionals that are mobile and can provide stabilization and continuity to our at-risk businesses. The main thing small businesses need right now is to replenish the cash that has been lost due to COVID-19. These SWAT teams should be formed through partnerships between the city and Baltimore based law, accounting and technology firms that are willing to volunteer and lend some of their time to help the businesses that make up our community. These professionals would provide immediate consulting, accounting, legal and technical assistance to businesses most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic – with the goals of helping to inject cash back into small businesses and helping stabilize them during these hard times. Finally, city leaders must recognize that the resources needed to keep our local businesses afloat are not all going to come from within the city. Many of these resources will come from the state and federal level, as well as the private sector. As the business landscape changes rapidly, there is an influx of new information and resources. City officials and city agencies, in close partnership with the Small Business Administration’s Baltimore District Office, must provide better guidance and act as a conduit to facilitate the rapid flow of resources to our businesses in Baltimore. In times of crisis, small businesses need three things – predictability, faith in our governing institutions and, most importantly, cash. If our city government can facilitate those three things, then many of our small businesses will be able to survive this exceptionally trying time. If the COVID-19 crisis has shown us anything, it has helped to illustrate the difference between the kind of leadership our city needs in times of crisis and uncertainty and what we have historically received. As we emerge from this pandemic, and we will, the evidence of which of our local leaders provided effective leadership during this crisis, and those who failed our city yet again, will be painfully clear.

‘It’s not easy’: For seniors in Baltimore, coronavirus social distancing comes with a side effect: loneliness
.W
Bernadette Croaker knows loneliness is taking a toll on her neighbors. No longer can they gather to enjoy the Wednesday movie nights that Croaker, 76, has hosted for the past eight years in a common room at Catholic Charities’ Owings Mills New Town senior apartments. Visits from family and friends have been curtailed at New Town and other senior living places in an effort to lower the possibility of any exposure to the coronavirus pandemic that has infected more than 400,000 across the globe and is most deadly to people over age 65 and the immuno-compromised. Aside from visits to the doctor and other necessary trips, they mostly stay in their apartments and use reversible smiley-face and frowny-face signs on their doors to let neighbors know how they’re feeling. Lately, Croaker has been trying to cheer folks up, encouraging them to do a “happy dance." “I know it’s affecting me mentally,” Croaker said. “It’s not easy. A lot of them are very depressed. We try to put a sense of humor in it for each other.” The social distance prescribed to slow the spread of the global pandemic can be particularly isolating for seniors, many of whom rely on regular visits, errands, religious services and social interaction in their living places for a sense of connection with their loved ones and communities. Family, friends, neighbors and others in the Baltimore area have been checking on seniors in a variety of ways, including phone calls, emails and running errands for them. Children are using sidewalk chalk to greet their elderly neighbors. And FaceTime, Skype and other video chat services are delighting them by connecting them to their families as they while away the time indoors. But the need for outreach will only grow the longer the coronavirus forces the elderly, and everyone else, to remain in an unending state of quarantine. A simple phone call or email can make a big difference to seniors coping with a more challenging sense of isolation than most, said Anita M. Wells, a clinical psychologist and associate professor in Morgan State University’s psychology department. If you see a funny photo or video as you’re absentmindedly scrolling through your social networks at home, Wells said, consider sending it to them. After all, they’re as bored and desperate for a smile as the rest of us. “We have a responsibility — really to ourselves and to our senior citizens — to reach out to them and to say, ‘Hey, I was thinking about you,’ " Wells said. Patricia Rosenfeld was walking outside to get her newspaper one morning this week when the 79-year-old Baltimore woman noticed a chalk drawing, smiling up at her from the sidewalk. “Have a happy day, Miss Trish! Love, Evi,” read the cheery note from her 9-year-old neighbor, Evi Vincent, whose father, Eric, had volunteered to pick up Rosenfeld’s prescriptions for her. “I just thought that was such a sweet thing to do,” said Rosenfeld, who lives alone in a house on Rosebank Avenue in the city’s Homeland neighborhood. Rosenfeld, whose family predeceased her, is a stage-four cancer survivor living with type-2 diabetes — one of many Baltimore-area seniors who would be considered at risk if exposed to the coronavirus. “My immune system’s very compromised,” she said. “I’m in for however long this lasts, unfortunately.” The coronavirus has forced Rosenfeld to suspend her volunteering for the Committee to Honor Vietnam Veterans at the Gilchrist Center, which canceled its planned fundraising gala next week. While many stores are asking customers not to buy in bulk to make sure enough provisions remain on shelves to go around, the Baltimore County Public Library had no such policy before closing indefinitely, so she checked out nearly two dozen books to occupy her time at home. “There’s no return date, because the libraries are closed,” Rosenfeld said. “I try not to read them all at once." Rosenfeld likes to travel and has been on 15 international trips with the Overseas Adventure Travel agency. She expects the next one on the schedule — a cruise in Paris at the end of June — to be canceled, but she’s holding out hope for three more she has planned next year. In the meantime, Rosenfeld has been passing the time with walks in the cemetery near her house, watching the squirrels and listening to the birds, and pondering just how lucky she is to be alive. “I’ve been thinking how wonderful this world is and how wonderful this country is,” she said. “It has many, many faults, particularly right now, but it’s still the best country on Earth.” Croaker is just three weeks removed from a hospitalization for congestive heart failure and fluid on the lungs. And she’s worried about a nationwide shortage of the medicine she uses to treat her lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Demand for the medication, hydroxychloroquine, has surged in recent days, after President Donald Trump touted it as a possible coronavirus treatment, and a nationwide shortage has been driven in part by doctors inappropriately prescribing it for themselves, their friends and families, according to ProPublica. What’s more, MTA Mobility is now only offering rides for essential trips — to the doctor, the supermarket and the bank. “They done shut us all down," Croaker said. "We cannot come out the apartment, because we don’t have nowhere to go. So it’s important for people to stay in touch with each other.” Some of Glenn Smith’s neighbors in the St. James Terrace Senior Apartments on Arlington Avenue in West Baltimore were frustrated by the closure of the community room where they like to play cards and shoot pool, he said. But Smith, 70, the vice president of the residents council, said he and many of his peers were raised with an adage that is helping them cope with their isolation: “A hard head makes a soft behind.” “I’ve been through most things people go through. I know when it’s time to be vigilant,” he said. “It’s really important we realize this coronavirus is nothing to take lightly. We just have to be vigilant and look out for ourselves.” At Brightview White Marsh — home to 72 assisted-living residents and another 25 in memory care — video chat sessions connect the elderly with their families, and staff members are making other adjustments to the daily routine, said Beth Lauf, vibrant living director. The normal community happy hour gathering has been replaced by a pair of refreshment carts that stop by residents’ rooms and offer drinks, adult coloring books and other activities, she said. “Just little things, when we go door-to-door, to make them smile," Lauf said. “We’re all here for one another right now." Ann Savige was offered a choice between wine and ginger ale. “I chose the wine,” said the 84-year-old, who has lived at Brightview for about a year. Meals have been brought to residents’ rooms, and they are provided with “every possible comfort,” she said. Savige said she has kept up with her daily phone calls with her daughter, and she described her first FaceTime experience with wonder. “I got to see my talented son-in-law and my one and only granddaughter,” Savige said. “It was just such a pleasure, because, of course, I’m very dependent on them for morale. They are a joy. ... I just think it’s fabulous.” Her neighbor Charlotte Stran’s daughters couldn’t visit for Stran’s 92nd birthday Monday. But the social quarantine didn’t prevent them from getting to see her smile as Brightview staffers brought out the birthday cake with rainbow sprinkles, the big balloon and the white daisies they’d sent, said Eileen Adams, who lives in White Marsh and usually visits her mother about three times a week. “It was my feel-good of the month," Adams said. “She understands that this is a really bad situation in the whole world. But it’s hard for her not to be with us. ... Even though I can’t see my mom, I feel like she’s loved and cared for. That’s all I can ask for right now.” Adams said she had addressed an email to the Brightview staffers who organized the call and found herself wondering: “What am I going to say to try to explain to them how much that meant to me?” “Just to see her face when they brought that cake — for her to recognize the three staff people in the room were her friends," she said. "It wasn’t ‘I’m alone,’ or ‘you’re not here.’ It was just looking for the joy in the moment. It was great.” Calls with family are a lifeline for the elderly amid a global pandemic that’s scary for all, Lauf said. “These are tough times, and everyone’s going through a lot," she said. "A small phone call really does go a long way. Your day-to-day is busy, but all they think about is you.” Baltimore Sun reporter Wilborn P. Nobles III contributed to this article.

No strangers to adversity, many historic Ellicott City restaurants offer carryout during coronavirus outbreak
.W
While restaurants, cafes and bars around the state are either temporarily closed or only allowed to provide carryout and delivery services amid the spread of the new coronavirus, Syriana Cafe in historic Ellicott City is taking it one step further by lending a helping hand to those in need and donating meals For every carryout meal purchased, the cafe is donating a meal to those in need through a partnership with Calvary Chapel. Syriana Cafe is open for carryout and delivery with limited hours from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily. Orders can be made by phone or online. Syriana Cafe is a family business that was created first as a social responsibility, a source of income second, owner Majd AlGhatrif said. First opened at 8180 Main St. in 2017 as a craft store and gallery, the cafe opened in early 2018. The cafe hires Syrian refugees to help them put food on their own tables, AlGhatrif said. The cafe also hosts monthly cultural events. “Yes, as ominous as this picture of holding hands might appear in this pandemic, as much as we need what it implies: being there for each other,” the cafe wrote in a Facebook post about its donation initiative. “In this ordeal, we were faced with the responsibility to maintain income to our hardworking staff, to provide food to our neighbors in need and to inject some joy in your lives with our delicious food,” the post states. “While it’s fiscally sensible for us to be closed, we find there is some opportunity while we are not on lockdown to provide some service, provide patrons with food and help those in need,” AlGhatrif said. The restaurant is also offering delivery with GrubHub. On Tuesday, the cafe donated 18 meals to the Calvary Chapel. Those meals were donated ahead of the buy a meal/donate a meal campaign. “We didn’t want to wait until next Tuesday to help people in need,” said AlGhatrif, who is looking to provide meals each Tuesday. Calvary Chapel Pastor Dan Sexton said he grew emotional when he received a text message from AlGhatrif, who was looking to lend a helping hand. Sexton has eaten at the cafe a couple of times and, after speaking with AlGhatrif on a few occasions, they exchanged contact information. Sexton was surprised that AlGhatrif remembered he was a pastor and that AlGhatrif wanted to give back to the community when he has to keep his own doors open. “I was really moved by his generosity,” Sexton said. The Tuesday meals will coincide with the grocery boxes the church provides to families weekly. In partnership with Trader Joe’s in Columbia, the church makes boxes out of the store’s grocery surplus. Besides the church, Syriana Cafe is looking to collaborate with other local organizations and churches. As of Thursday, there have been at least 107 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Maryland, according to state officials, with 16 of those in Howard County. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Thursday that a 5-year-old girl in Howard County has tested positive, the first case with a child. There has been one death in the state so far, a Prince George’s man in his 60s. Restaurants offering carryout, limited service Historic Ellicott City restaurants and small businesses are no strangers to having to close abruptly and not knowing when they will reopen. Many of the businesses along Ellicott City’s Main Street have suffered from two catastrophic, deadly floods in 2016 and 2018 that left the downtown area devastated. Some reopened, while some owners decided to move on. “This is a whole different kind of thing, but the fact we have dealt with such extreme things in the past with the flooding, we are way more prepared than most people are,” said Jeni Porter, owner of Little Market Cafe. For now, Little Market Cafe is offering its full menu from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily through carryout only. Patrons can order and pay by phone ahead of time, so they don’t have to stand in line, Porter said. The cafe will take it day by day and is keeping in mind the safety of its staff, Porter said. Little Market Cafe, as well as the Phoenix Emporium and Jaxon Edwin, recently were part of the filming of a special two-hour episode of “24 Hours to Hell and Back” that will air in May. Celebrity chef and TV personality Gordon Ramsay was in historic Ellicott City at the end of February for the renovations and filming. “This whole sort of team descended upon that gorgeous little town. I understood ... no one’s looking for a pity party — let’s get that right,” Ramsey said in an interview on Feb. 28. “They were just desperately struggling to bounce back the way they should’ve done, but who can on the back of two critical, serious adversities. It’s bloody hard.” Porter said this week the quiet streets are “very reminiscent of the flood except that nothing is destroyed.” After previously saying the Phoenix Emporium’s lower Main Street location would permanently end its restaurant and bar service and not serve carryout, owner Mark Hemmis changed his mind. He said the reversal was because of his strong commitment to his employees. “After both floods, all of my employees were able to find temporary jobs at other restaurants and bars,” Hemmis said Thursday. “That is not possible with this current closure.” Phoenix Brewing Company, a merger of the Phoenix Emporium and Ellicott Mills Brewing Company, is closed and will not serve carryout at its new upper Main Street location at this time. The original lower Main Street location is serving carryout, and patrons also can purchase gift certificates. Hemmis said 100% “of the sales of gift certificates and carryout is going into a fund that will provide emergency relief for my employees. I could have never come back from either flood without them. I’m doing anything I can to make sure that they are taken care of.” Carryout and curbside pickup is available from 5 to 9 p.m. every day with a daily menu posted at 3 p.m. Patrons can begin calling at 4:45 p.m. every day at 410-465-5665 to place an order. To purchase mail-ordered gift certificates, customers can call 410-313-8141 from noon to 4 p.m. The certificates will be mailed the same day as they are purchased. Georgia Grace Cafe, located on lower Main Street, also is offering carryout services. The cafe’s modified schedule is from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. from Wednesday to Sunday. Owner Paula Dwyer said this week she is looking to provide a service to those who need food. “It’s a fluid situation,” Dwyer said. “I want to still have the service for people.” Matcha Time Cafe, a Japanese cafe and gift shop, is operating with carryout, call-in orders and GrubHub delivery from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday to Monday. The cafe is staying open to be able to pay its bills and its employees, said co-owner Derek Smith. The cafe will make adjustments as necessary. “To say business is still great is a flat-out lie; it’s terrible,” Smith said. “We went from being pretty busy, pretty much status quo, to barely making enough to keep the lights on.” While Sweet Cascades Chocolatier’s two Howard County locations are temporarily closed, the kitchen is open to fulfill Easter bunny orders and any other chocolate goodies, according to owner Sue Whary. Its Main Street location and shop within the Savage Mill are closed. “If [residents] are missing their favorite chocolate, they can call us and place an order or visit our website and get it shipped,” Whary said. “We’ll get the chocolates to them.” As orders are made and ready to be delivered, there will be a curbside pickup option or the orders can be shipped directly to a patron’s home. Customers can call 410-750-8422 or visit sweetcascadeschocolatier.com. La Palapa Grill, at 8307 Main St., is offering carryout and curbside pickup every day from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Old Mill Cafe, located across the Patapsco River from Main Street, is open for carryout and curbside pickup with a limited menu from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day. People are asked to call 410-465-2253 to order. “Until further notice, will keep our business and doors open in an effort to continue to support the community and keep our staff on payroll,” a representative from the restaurant said in a statement. The Trolley Stop near Old Mill Cafe is offering carryout for its lunch and dinner menus from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. The restaurant also has beer, wine and liquor available for carryout purchase. Judge’s Bench, a historic pub with 19 rotating taps at 8385 Main St., is open for growler sales from 3 to 8 p.m. Friday and 2 to 7 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. A limited menu of carryout food items is also available with any growler order. For information, call 410-465-3497 or go to judgesbenchpub.com. Main Street businesses temporarily closed Tersiguel’s French Country Restaurant announced last week it will be temporarily closed and hopes to return to normal operating hours as soon as it is able. “With heavy hearts, we are suspending operations,” the restaurant wrote in a Facebook post. “We all have to do our part during this outbreak, this is ours.” Even with being closed, the restaurant is encouraging patrons to frequent small businesses at this time. “On a personal note, our restaurant family and extended [Old Ellicott City] business community has been here before. We encourage you to frequent small businesses in the coming weeks and months. We thank you for your continued support,” according to the restaurant’s website. UMI Sushi announced last week it also will temporarily be closed. The Japanese restaurant hopes to reopen as soon as possible, according to its Facebook page. Manor Hill Tavern, at 3733 Old Columbia Pike, offered curbside pickup for a brief time but has since closed completely. “Manor Hill Tavern is committed to the safety of our staff, our guests and our community and have made the difficult decision to close until it is safe to reopen,” a post on the restaurant’s website reads.

From sore throat to quarantine: Two young Baltimore residents, two very different coronavirus cases
.W
Cara Yerman awoke about 1 a.m. March 18 to the light being switched on in the Baltimore hospital room where she’d been placed the night before, hooked up to an IV and on oxygen, with a bucket to pee in so she didn’t contaminate the adjacent bathroom. “You’ve tested positive,” said the kind Sinai Hospital nurse who woke her, she recalled. Yerman was being moved, to a room on a more isolated floor. Her diagnosis — COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus — weighed on her, heavy like her breath. Leading up to that night, Yerman had been through the wringer: a high fever, chills, vomiting, severe weakness and a pounding heartbeat. “I thought I was dying,” the 26-year-old speech and language pathologist said in an interview. “That sounds dramatic, but it’s true.” Across town, in Mount Vernon, a 22-year-old Baltimore resident named Mike was at home. Like Yerman, he’d first felt a throat scratch more than a week prior, on March 9. Like her, he’d gone to a local hospital — Mercy Medical Center — to get tested. Like her, he would later test positive. But his symptoms were far milder. While Yerman felt wretched and would be diagnosed with pneumonia, requiring a dayslong hospital stay, Mike — who asked to be identified only by his first name, to maintain his privacy — felt like he had the flu, and was left to recover at home. Both in their 20s, both otherwise healthy, they experienced the same virus in wildly different ways. It’s a disparity playing out in cases all across the globe. The new coronavirus can devastate the lungs. It has spread to nearly 1 million people around the world and has killed almost 50,000. The United States now has the most cases of any country, with a massive cluster in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where both Yerman and Mike had traveled just before they got sick. More than 5,100 people have died in the U.S. ‘I was extremely scared’ Yerman, a self-described “cat person,” is bubbly and lives a healthy life, she said. She woke next to her fiancée March 9 with an itch in her throat. Within days, she was hospitalized, using oxygen to breathe. Yerman said she never would have visited New York on March 7 had she known what the city would look like a few weeks later. At that point, bars, restaurants and shops remained open; normal life continued. She retreated from her Baltimore apartment to her parents’ home in Baltimore County as her symptoms worsened. Her parents did what they could — but nothing helped. As her fever spiked, Yerman said, she felt nauseated. A doctor tested her for the flu and sent her home with Tamiflu and antibiotics, she said. “You’re fine,” she repeated to herself. Her body, however, felt otherwise. She didn’t improve. Eventually she was advised by phone to go to the emergency room, where Sinai workers screened her at the door and asked about recent travel. When she said “yes” to having been to the New York area, they looked concerned, she recalled. Staffers swabbed up her nose and took chest X-rays, then sent her home with an inhaler, she said. The next day, she was back, with a fever of 102 degrees. More X-rays showed severe bilateral pneumonia, she was told. Nurses in head-to-toe protective gear isolated her in the room, attached to machines. Later came the bucket. Yerman said a staffer hung a sign on the door: “PUI,” for patient under investigation. “I was extremely scared,” she said. Dr. Matt Poffenroth, LifeBridge Health’s chief clinical officer, who oversees Sinai and other hospitals in the network, said he could not comment on Yerman’s case because of privacy laws. Most patients he considers “worth major concern” are 60 and above. However, those who show severe symptoms, like Yerman, or who have recently traveled should be tested, too, he said. Positive patients are moved to negative pressure isolation rooms, he said, but the system doesn’t have enough. Yerman’s mother wasn’t allowed with her in the isolation room. She spent the next few days battling a strange virus alone. “You’re young. You will fight this," the kind nurse reassured her, Yerman recalled. She would cling to those words for days. ‘It might be the flu’ At first, Mike went to work at his banking job despite his sore throat. But after a day and a half, he started to feel worse and began staying home, he said. That Thursday, March 12, he decided to get tested. “I was light-headed, had headaches. I was very lethargic and tired for most of the day. I felt nauseous at points, and I still had the cough, the sore throat,” he said. “I figured it might be the flu, but with corona going around I couldn’t be too sure.” He said he went to nearby Mercy Medical Center, where workers tested him for the flu. He then went home to await the results. The next day, the hospital called back, told him he had tested negative for the flu, and asked him to come back. When he got there, staff met him in the parking garage, he said, and ushered him into his own room. He was tested for the flu again, he said, and again came up negative. Then came the coronavirus test, a swab up the nose, he said. Mike again went home to the apartment he inhabits with two roommates, in a big rowhouse that shares an entrance with another apartment where four people live. Mercy staff told him to quarantine himself until the results came back, which he said he did. That weekend, the symptoms “got a little bit worse." Plus, “I lost all sense of taste and smell,” he said — an experience reported by other coronavirus patients around the world. Finally, on March 26, just as he was starting to see the first signs of “real improvement,” and nearly a week after being tested, Mike was told his test was positive, he said. The same day, someone from the Baltimore City Health Department called, “asking me where I’d been the two weeks prior, if I had done anything in the week where I had felt sick but hadn’t been tested yet,” Mike recalled. “They asked me about my symptoms and whether they had worsened over the days.” They also told him that he would have to quarantine himself for the entire time he had symptoms, and for at least a week after the last of his symptoms had abated, he said. “Before I do anything else, I have to get tested again and get negative results,” he said. Neither the city health department nor Mercy would comment on Mike’s case. However, city officials confirmed his experience was consistent with how the health department is responding to cases. Mike is still not sure how he caught the virus, but he had just visited his parents in New Jersey. He informed his parents, other family, friends, his boss and his roommates. And he told his landlord, who told the tenants upstairs. Since then, he and his roommates have been quarantining themselves, he said, trying to stay apart and keep shared spaces clean. Jaime Ramirez, who lives in the upstairs apartment, said since their landlord informed them of Mike’s illness, he and his roommates also have been staying at home, venturing out only for groceries. “For the most part, we’re all pretty level headed about it, knowing that [Mike’s] doing well, which is awesome,” Ramirez said. “We kind of have a routine down where if one of us is in the kitchen, we give each other space.” Back home Yerman spent two more days recovering in the hospital before being discharged, at times playing her favorite Bruce Springsteen Spotify playlist to lift her spirits. She went back to her parents’ home, where she quarantined herself in a private bedroom and bathroom, her parents delivering meals to her door wearing protective gear. Now she’s returned to her apartment, showing only minor symptoms. Yerman’s mother, Michele, said the last few weeks have been among the most traumatizing of her life. Aside from watching her oldest daughter fight off a potentially deadly virus, Michele Yerman said she felt uneasy not knowing how to treat the coronavirus or to lessen the rest of the family’s chance of exposure. “I couldn’t comfort her the way I was used to comforting her — with hugs and kisses,” Michele Yerman said. “It was rough and not easy and not expected. I was like, ‘Wait, I thought she was going to be fine?'" As of last week, Michele Yerman had tested negative for the disease, “a miracle” considering how much time she spent by Cara’s side, she said. Today, Cara Yerman’s pain and discomfort have largely subsided. She set up a blog to document her experience in the hope it would reach others and motivate them to stay home and slow the spread. Like the virus, the blog spread fast, far and wide. “I’ve had numerous people reaching out and saying, ‘Your article made me stop going out,’” she said. “It was a wake-up call, and I didn’t know people needed a wake-up call.” Yerman said she knows people who will disregard calls for social distancing and expects others to disbelieve her account. It’s their loss, she said. “I was taking it very seriously, and I still ended up in a situation where I got it,” she said. “I hope they don’t learn the hard way.”

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan wants to tap millions of dollars in emergency funds to prepare for coronavirus
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday that he plans to seek immediate access to millions of dollars in the state’s rainy day fund to fight the novel coronavirus in addition to $10 million in extra funding in the state budget. There are no confirmed cases in the state, though 21 people have been tested in Maryland for the virus that has infected 159 people across the country and tens of thousands of people in countries across the globe. Ten people in Maryland already have tested negative, according to the Maryland Department of Health. The funding will allow the state to be ready if there are cases of COVID-19, which causes respiratory symptoms such as coughing and trouble breathing. Most cases are mild, but scientists believe the virus leads to hospitalization for about 16% of cases and death in less than 1%. Public health officials across the country say more infections are likely, and other states also have been taking steps to bolster funding to prepare, as has the federal government. Emergency legislation was introduced in the Maryland Senate shortly after Hogan said during the regular meeting of the state’s Board of Public Works in Annapolis that he wanted authority to transfer $50 million from the state’s rainy day fund, formally called the Revenue Stabilization Account. In a sign of the urgency, rules were suspended to send the bill directly to committee. “Here in Maryland there is not yet any public health emergency,” Hogan said at the board meeting. “As of this morning, 21 individuals in Maryland have been tested: 10 results have been negative; 11 still remain pending. There are no positive cases. While we continue to hope for the best, we are also actively planning for the worst.” The Maryland Emergency Management Agency also raised its activation level to “enhanced.” That is one step above normal operations on a four-step scale and means an event requires additional monitoring or resources from across state government. Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young took similar action, raising its emergency operations level to “watch level” and said city leaders would coordinate with local health officials, who are leading the city’s preparedness efforts, as well as the state’s emergency management office. “While we have not experienced any confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Maryland, we must remain vigilant and prepared,” Young said in a statement. Hogan said, “Our state is taking every precaution when it comes to the coronavirus." Hogan hasn’t outlined specific uses for the emergency funds. He said generally that it is for costs associated with the virus response and gives the state “flexibility to immediately access resources.” He said the funding he plans to seek in the state budget will be based on the state health department’s contingency planning, though details also have not been released. Hogan also said this week that he expects the administration of President Donald Trump to request $3 billion in extra funds for coronavirus response. Hogan expected the state would be able to seek reimbursement for costs associated with monitoring and testing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that it plans to provide Maryland with $500,000 in initial funding to support the state’s virus response. The funds were for such activities as monitoring travelers, data management, lab equipment and supplies, staffing, infection control and testing. “CDC is committed to working with state, local, tribal and territorial public health departments to mitigate community spread of novel coronavirus in this nation,” CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield said in a statement. “Our partners are on the front lines of this response and we support their efforts to increase needed public health capacity to confront the challenges this virus presents.” The state health department has said it is not charging for the testing for COVID-19, but people may be charged for a blood test by their health provider. The state received federal authority Tuesday to do its own testing, rather than send samples to the CDC in Atlanta, and already has begun running the tests. This is expected to shorten the time for test results to a day from two to three days — time patients had to stay secluded in their homes. Fran Phillips, Maryland’s deputy secretary for public health services, briefed a group of state lawmakers in Annapolis on Wednesday afternoon and said she visited the state lab earlier in the day. She said the staff is “prepared to move into a higher volume of testing” if needed, including working overtime as necessary. The East Baltimore lab can handle about 50 to 60 tests in a regular workday. Phillips said officials are working with private labs in the hope that they, too, could begin handle tests. “It’s a matter of time,” she said, before there’s a confirmed case in this state. “It’s difficult to know what’s going to come,” she said. “Frankly, we don’t know if this will be a full-blown pandemic or if this will be a relatively minor event.” Even if the virus quiets down, it still might come back again months later, Phillips added. Peter Franchot, the state comptroller, said there were a lot of economic issues for the state stemming from a potential outbreak here. Already there have been effects, even without a case. He cited a slowdown of cargo imports at the state-owned Port of Baltimore and the potential for a slowdown in travel through the state’s BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport. Money invested by the state would be affected by large financial market movements — most market indexes already are down about 8% — and a dip in consumer confidence that could cost the state. “There are economic and fiscal impacts that coronavirus has already caused for our state and will continue if the outbreak worsens,” Franchot said before announcing he plans to convene a forum at the University of Baltimore with “experts and stakeholders” on March 24 to discuss the current and potential impacts. So far, there are few signs that major events in the state are being canceled or postponed, as they have been in some U.S. cities. Young said Wednesday during a news conference that there are not immediate plans to do so in Baltimore. “We’re not canceling anything,” he said.

Baltimore Police report more than $1.3 million in expenses related to the coronavirus, see drop in some crime categories 
.W
Baltimore Police have spent $1,328,327 in additional expenses for overtime, laptops, cleaning and equipment amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, department officials said Thursday at the Baltimore City Council’s monthly oversight hearing. About $510,000 has gone to salaries and overtime specifically related to the department’s COVID-19 response, including additional units dispatched to respond to business checks to enforce Gov. Larry Hogan’s orders to shutter all nonessential businesses to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Nearly $800,000 has been spent on equipment, such as personal protective equipment like masks, according to department figures. The spending has been critical to help the department limit the spread of the coronavirus among its 2,500 ranks, James Gillis, deputy commissioner of the department’s administrative bureau, said at the hearing. According to department figures, 360 staff members have been quarantined since the outbreak began last month in Baltimore, 175 have been tested and 26 have tested positive, of which 23 have returned to work. Only 17 remained quarantined. In response to the pandemic, the department has spent $269,000 on technology, $224,000 on laptops for employees to work from home, $108,000 on personal protective equipment, $28,000 on miscellaneous items and $28,000 on cleaning. The department has also spent $137,000 on tactical equipment in preparation for any civil unrest, Gillis said. “We just want to be as prepared as possible,” Gillis said. "Hopefully never get to that point.” Deputy Commissioner Michael Sullivan spoke of the department’s efforts beginning in early March to prepare for the spread of the pandemic. Gillis said all officers who are working have been given N95 masks, and should have received gloves and hand sanitizer. The department has also distributed kits to disinfect police vehicles in between shifts. Given that the virus is likely to remain a threat, Gillis said, “we are always looking to build the stockpile bigger than it is." The department is tracking the costs closely and hoping to recoup the funding through the federal government, he said. While the department has had to adapt how it responds to calls in light of the virus, the latest department figures show that overall calls for service are down 26% and crime is trending down. Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said a number of major crime categories have continued to decline since before the stay-at-home restrictions were put in place, with exceptions of home invasions, which have risen sharply, and homicides, which have remained flat. There have been 85 killings this year, which is similar to the same time last year. Home invasions are up 63%. City Council President Brandon Scott said he spoke with the commissioner before the stay-at-home orders were put in place about his concerns for the potential for increase home invasions. “I’m not satisfied with where we are,” he said of the numbers, including homicides. Chief of Patrol Col. Richard Worley said the increase is partially connected to a number of home invasions in the Southwestern and Southeastern districts in which a dozen people have been arrested. The group is believed to be responsible for at least 30 cases in the city, he said. The Southeastern District has a large increase, where Worley said a robbery crew had targeted Hispanic residents, but he said it is not yet clear how they targeted certain homes.

Baltimore-based Lutheran World Relief preparing response to coronavirus in Africa: ‘This is a moment of unity’
.W
From her home in the shadow of Camden Yards, Allyson Bear is working on a complex problem: how to bring resources and humanitarian aid from Baltimore-based Lutheran World Relief to African countries as people there cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Bear, a vice president for Lutheran World Relief, said weak health systems, widespread poverty and crowded urban slums put Africans at extreme risk. “This crisis is so unique, because it is happening everywhere at once,” said Bear, who has worked for 20 years in public health. Responding to emergencies typically involves marshaling resources from an unaffected area to bring to an affected area, she said. In this case, communities are focused on their needs and competing for high-demand supplies, such as masks, medical gloves and ventilators. In Africa, the need is great and growing, Bear said. While confirmed cases are not showing up in great numbers relative to other places, that’s due to a lag in testing, rather than a sign the virus is not spreading there. Worldwide some 526,000 people have tested positive for the new coronavirus and nearly 24,000 people had died as of Thursday night. Lutheran World Relief, which merged last year with Washington-based IMA World Health, is on the ground in multiple African countries. But, Bear said, getting specific aid to the continent is a twofold problem. Borders throughout Africa have been closed to airplanes and ships to slow the spread of the virus. Plus, supplies worldwide are being channeled to wealthier countries like the United States. “At the moment, when we need to be moving people and resources towards Africa to help them deal with this crisis, we can’t get there,” Bear said. The goal for now, Bear said, is to adapt programs already underway to provide outreach in response to the pandemic. The organization runs a $140 million operation with 550 employees from its headquarters at 700 Light St. in Baltimore. It works in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia with a mission to help people stay healthy and teach them to feed and support themselves so they can become stabilized in their native countries. In Kenya, for example, Bear said, its teams provide health care for people living with HIV in the slums of Nairobi. In response to the pandemic, she said, they provide multiple months of the HIV drugs at a single visit, educate people about the importance of hand-washing and repurpose protective equipment used for HIV to help with the new coronavirus. Going forward, Bear said, the sooner resources can be freed up in the U.S., the faster help can be sent to Africa. Besides donating to worldwide causes, she said, people in the U.S. can improve the situation elsewhere by contributing to the slow of the coronavirus’ spread here. “This is a moment of unity,” Bear said. “We are all in this together. Every single person, in Baltimore, in Maryland, in the world, has a role to play. We are not victims. We can be heroes in this response.”

Maryland orders all enclosed shopping malls closed to slow spread of coronavirus: ‘It’s like a ghost town’ 
.W
With Gov. Larry Hogan ordering malls to shutter Thursday, the walls of self-isolation to slow the spread of the new coronavirus closed in even further. Tara Reid has always considered herself an introvert, but now finds herself nostalgic for each simple and sequentially lost pleasure of just days ago — a restaurant meal, a concert and, now, shopping. “I feel social distance has become emotional distance as well,” said Reid, 46, who lives in Columbia. “We are a lot more social creatures than we realize until something like this happens.” Daily, either Hogan has directed, or businesses on their own have decided, to shutter places where people tend to congregate and provide easy transmission pathways for the coronavirus. In addition to closing the malls Thursday, Hogan further shrank the size of gatherings to no more than 10. The measures came as the state reported at least 107 confirmed cases as of Thursday morning, resulting in one death so far. Shutting the malls became increasingly inevitable as at least three in the state ― including the sprawling Arundel Mills ― had previously closed, as had anchor and specialty stores across the country. A Johns Hopkins epidemiologist said that reducing the opportunities for people to interact with others who may carry the virus will help decrease its transmission. But, said Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health, every closing comes with consequences — from unemployment to diminished “social cohesion” to questions of sustainability should the shutdowns continue for months rather than weeks. “We’ve never done this before. This is a huge social experiment,” said Nuzzo, an epidemiologist. “I do have worries how long we can do this.” Nuzzo said she thinks it’s good the closures were ordered over time rather than all at once, first the schools, then the bars, restaurants, gyms, movie theaters and now the malls. “It gives people a chance to adjust to this very radical change in life,” she said. The governor did not specify a timeline when malls would reopen. Shopping centers that are not enclosed, such as Hunt Valley Towne Center, remain open. “There isn’t a physical barrier,” said Michelle J. Schiffer, an executive with Greenberg Gibbons, which manages the Baltimore County center. But Schiffer said most of the apparel stores have closed, following directives from their national headquarters, while gyms and restaurants, except for takeout, also have closed under the state orders. The Wegmans grocery store remains open. In Howard County, officials declared a state of emergency Sunday and closed The Mall in Columbia. The mall always has been the planned community’s main street, and newer development has given its location more of a downtown feel. Reid moved to a nearby apartment specifically to be able to walk to the mall and other nearby venues. Now, though, “it’s like a ghost town,” she said. She’s feeling the isolation particularly keenly, given that she’s been idled from her work assisting midwives and as a doula for new mothers now that there are new restrictions on the number of people who can see hospital patients. “I get it,” she said of the cutbacks and closures. "I’m not sure we were prepared for such a shutdown. “This is sort of a post-9/11 feeling,” Reid said. “No one knows what to do or think. It’s eerie.” That streets are emptier and people more dispersed makes Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman think the message is getting through that social distancing is critical to preventing the transmission of the coronavirus. “The sooner we slow down the spread, the better chance we have of controlling it and responding to the illness that we’ll see,” said Kalyanaraman, Anne Arundel County’s health officer. Closing the malls checks another large gathering place off the list, he said. “What’s left really are the places where you can get the basics,” Kalyanaraman said — the Walmarts, the grocery stores and pharmacies. He is glad to see that even those retailers in some cases are adjusting to limit the spread of the virus, such as setting aside special hours for older shoppers. For the malls, the shutdown comes at a time when some are struggling already, having seen much of their traffic shift to big-box retailers and online. An indefinite shutdown won’t help. Still, says one professor at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, College Park, don’t count out the shopping center just yet. “It’s been an essential part of the American retail landscape for about a century,” said Jie Zhang, a professor of marketing. Shoppers still like to buy jewelry, apparel, cosmetics and other “products that we want but we don’t need" in the real rather than online world, she said. “They want to touch and feel it,” Zhang said. “You’re out, you’re with your girlfriends, and you buy it.” But of course, she said, should people be denied trips to the mall for months and not buy any apparel during that time, they could then realize they were just fine without new clothes. While malls had until 5 p.m. Thursday, others had previously shuttered. In Hanover, the Simon Property Group closed its Arundel Mills mall Tuesday evening, “after extensive discussions with federal, state and local officials,” according to a notice on the mall’s website. The 1,630,000-square-foot Arundel Mills and the vast majority of the center’s stores will be closed until at least March 29. The mall’s website shows several businesses that remain open, though the information may be out-of-date: Maryland Live! Casino and Hotel is listed as “open,” despite a previous emergency order by Hogan specifically closing the state’s casinos. Westfield Annapolis also closed temporarily although no reopen date was listed in the announcement. “Some retailers may still be open so that ‘essential’ retail remains in operation for customers. While we will endeavor to reflect these store hours on this website, please confirm their hours directly,” according to Westfield’s notice. The economic impact of retail closures could be sizable, said Andy Bauer, regional executive for the Baltimore branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. About 12 percent of Maryland’s employment works in retail, and they make about 7 percent of all wages, he said. He does not anticipate the mall closures will send shoppers swarming to the freestanding stores on main streets or in open-air shopping centers. “No matter where they’re located, they’re seeing less traffic,” Bauer said. “I’ve been spending days talking to businesses, and there’s less economic activity across the board. “People have heard the message: We have to reduce the spread of the coronavirus,” he said. While retail numbers will plunge for the month, Bauer foresees a quick and robust recovery once testing is more widely available and can show whether the social distancing measures are successful. “When you talk to businesses,” he said, “everybody has the expectation after we’ve actually gone through all this for activity to rebound sharply.”

IAAM, MIAA hope ‘to return to play at some point’ after spring sports season is suspended by coronavirus
.W
In a joint statement, the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) and Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland (IAAM) remained hopeful Monday that the spring sports season suspended by the coronavirus pandemic can eventually resume. The leagues, which supervise private school athletic competition in the area, are following the same mandate as the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA), with the suspension of the season extended to April 27. Saints Peter & Paul, a member of both the IAAM and MIAA based in Easton, has already decided not to field teams for the potentially abbreviated spring season. “The leadership of the MIAA and IAAM remain hopeful that both leagues will be able to offer our student athletes an opportunity to return to play at some point this season," the statement, signed by IAAM executive director Sue Thompson and MIAA executive director Lee Dove, said. "Both leagues will continue in their efforts to consider possible options dependent upon the re-opening of schools. Further details are unavailable at this time.” Two weeks ago, the IAAM said that its Board of Governors would evaluate regular-season standings, postseason play and a possible extension of the spring season at an April 13 meeting. On Monday, Gov. Larry Hogan issues a “stay at home” order for state residents in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Marylanders may only leave their homes for essential work or urgent medical care, to get food or prescriptions or for other “absolutely necessary” reasons. The order takes effect at 8 p.m. Monday. The governor said the ban includes restrictions on traveling outside of the state and riding public transportation. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 14 percent as of Monday, state officials said, following an outbreak over the weekend that infected 66 residents and killed one at a Carroll County nursing home. The number of COVID-19 deaths in Maryland remained at 15 Monday morning, after rising from 10 Saturday, officials said. The number of confirmed cases in the state was 1,413, as of Monday.

Maryland’s car dealers asked to move sales online or appointment-only amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
The Maryland Automobile Dealers Association has asked its members to move the sales of vehicles online or through appointment only as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the state. The request of the association’s roughly 300 members was in response to the stay-at-home order Gov. Larry Hogan issued Monday, President Peter Kitzmiller said Tuesday. Kitzmiller said that while the executive order did not change dealers’ designation as essential businesses, the association has continued to evaluate how to best conduct business as the outbreak has escalated. He added that social distancing measures will be in place at car dealerships even for customers with appointments, saying that some people who are interested in test driving vehicles will do so without an employee in the car. Kata Hall, a spokeswoman for Hogan, wrote on Twitter that the Maryland Automobile Dealers Association announced it will close all sales departments at car and truck dealerships across the state. Kitzmiller clarified that the association wasn’t issuing a mandate, but was offering guidance as to how to operate in compliance with the new executive orders. “We’re not the [Motor Vehicle Association],” he said. Kitzmiller disagreed with the characterization of calling sales departments “closed,” saying they are simply moving away from accepting walk-in customers. Hall added that service and parts departments could remain open, but other administrative tasks would be moved to telecommuting whenever possible. Hogan on Monday ordered all non-essential businesses closed and for residents to stay at home unless shopping for food or other critical items in response to the growing COVID-19 outbreak, which has infected at least 1,660 people as of Tuesday morning, leading to 18 deaths in the state.

Social Security Administration needs to make telework a priority even after coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
On behalf of Social Security Administration employees in field offices, teleservice centers and payment centers, I want to thank Commissioner Andrew Saul for taking action to protect public health by allowing employees to work from home amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting March 23, our workforce has had the privilege to continue to answer questions from Social Security recipients, respond to claims and do the work of the American people from the safety of our homes. This pandemic has made it abundantly clear the kind of work that is essential to allow our society to continue to function. That includes grocery store workers and food supply chain workers, waste management collectors and health care workers that are treating hundreds of thousands of patients each day. It also includes our colleagues at the Internal Revenue Service who are in the midst of dispersing billions of dollars in stimulus checks and Social Security employees who ensure people who rely on our services can have peace of mind in a crisis. In doing that essential public service, Social Security employees have found that not only are they able to efficiently work from home, they can provide an even better public service in a time of increased uncertainty. Before the implementation of telework, our field office employees had a 70% response rate to claimants, a rate that has increased to 95% in our remote work world. Employees are able to avoid long commutes, save money on gas and car maintenance and are reporting a larger sense of security and satisfaction. We’ve only experienced a lag in responding to our toll-free, 800-number because telecommunications employees have not received the software necessary to answer calls and maintain the privacy of Social Security recipients. While all of these attributes are certainly a cause for celebration, it should come as no surprise that telework is a successful program. The Social Security Administration had a telework program in place for thousands of employees from 2013-2019 that was proven to increase morale and boost productivity. However, in November 2019, Commissioner Saul rescinded telework for 12,000 employees with little to no justification. At the time, the move was criticized in Congress and deemed arbitrary and old school. Why not allow your workforce to maintain flexibility in times of possible crisis? What if there’s inclement weather, or, God forbid, a pandemic that prevents people from going to a common workplace every day? Certainly, we don’t expect the agency to allow its employees to work from home indefinitely. There’s already been plenty of discussion on how we begin to reopen parts of the economy, go back to work and find our way back to normal. The simple fact is that we cannot go back to things as they were. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, we don’t have nearly enough resources to test everyone who might have COVID-19, contact trace those who may have infected others or isolate outbreaks. To reopen over 1,000 Social Security field offices, which experience high foot traffic as hundreds of people visit each week for face-to-face appointments with employees, would be to put the public health of our seniors who rely on Social Security at risk. We need to find a solution that allows us to do the work of the public safely and securely, for both the public and Social Security employees. That may include allowing field offices to receive visitors by appointment only, ensuring we have a safe number of people in the waiting area at all times. We could further stagger visitation times so that field office employees could retain three days a week of telework to continue to process claims and speak to claimants over the phone in the controlled environment of their homes. We already know our customer service has improved dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we don’t anticipate the American public will be eager to wait in a packed waiting area in proximity to others. We also propose allowing employees in our telecommunication centers to work 100% remotely. The work of our telecommunications professionals already takes place over the phone, and we saw an increase in productivity among these employees during our 2013-2019 telework program. There’s no need for hundreds of employees to be packed together like sardines in a multistory building of they’re going to be on the phone the whole time anyway. No matter what has been said from the White House press briefing room, we aren’t going back to the way things were anytime soon. Instead of constantly catching up to the private sector, the federal government must lead on remote work. The service we provide is too important to imperil for political calculations or decisions that ignore public health recommendations. That means telework must remain a part of what we do for all employees. Ralph de Juliis (ralph.de.juliis@sbcglobal.net) is the president of AFGE Council 220, which represents employees at the Social Security Administration.

Flu outbreak sickens 82 on Royal Carribean cruise from Baltimore; none met coronavirus criteria, cruise line says
.W
A flu outbreak sickened 82 people aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship that returned to Baltimore last week, prompting the cruise line to isolate them and notify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but none of the sick passengers and crew met the criteria for the coronavirus, a Royal Carribean spokeswoman confirmed Friday. None of the passengers had transited the COVID-19′s regions of impact or interacted with anyone in those regions within 14 days of the onset of their symptoms, spokeswoman Melissa Charbonneau said. “An elevated number of guests and crew had flu-like illness or tested positive for influenza A or B and were placed in isolation, according to medical protocol," Charbonneau said in an emailed statement. “The CDC did not request coronavirus tests for any of the cases.” The CDC did not respond to a request for comment late Friday afternoon. Three more Marylanders are being tested for COVID-19, the coronavirus disease that has sickened more than 80,000 people globally, state officials confirmed this week. The Grandeur of the Seas sails from the port of Baltimore’s cruise terminal to Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Barbados and St. Kitts & Nevis. Amid the concerns about the coronavirus, cruise passengers leaving from Baltimore are now being screened before boarding the cruise ships, and anyone who has visited areas affected by the disease or who has come into contact with others who have been to those areas in the past two weeks will not be allowed to board, port officials said Thursday. Anticipating a decrease in cargo due to the global outbreak, the operator of the port of Baltimore’s container terminal announced a reduction in the terminal’s hours beginning next week.

'Just doing my job’: Carroll County grocery, retail workers glad to play role during coronavirus crisis
.W
Deemed essential workers and dealing with the Great Run on Toilet Paper early on in the coronavirus pandemic, grocery store clerks have become unexpected front line workers in the social war on the viral contagion. But here in Carroll County, some say they’re just doing their job. “About a month ago they started handing out papers for us in case we get pulled over, or a law officer or somebody needs to know why we are out on the road,” said Brian Haines, who has been stocking shelves on the night shift at the Westminster Walmart for about two years. "I called my mom and said, ‘I never thought that working overnight at Walmart would make me an essential employee.’” Diana Freundel, who has been cashiering at the Westminster Weis for five months, feels much the same way. “Me, personally, I just think it’s another day going into work,” she said. “There is nothing really out of the ordinary, we all know the rules and follow them and feel like it’s a normal.” At Weis, the rules have involved observing the standard social distancing rules and keeping six feet apart, according to Jessica Tanzey, another cashier who worked at the Westminster store in high school and recently returned after her serving job disappeared due to Gov. Larry Hogan’s order closing restaurants. “Weis has taken some good precautions starting with last week when we got Plexiglass shields installed,” she said. “As a person walks up a the conveyor belt, there is a layer of plexi and it prevents respiratory droplets from spreading.” It’s a fast-moving situation. Tanzey, speaking Tuesday, said management hadn’t yet asked employees to wear masks, but that had changed as of Wednesday or Thursday, according to Freundel. “They are mandating everyone that comes in the store has to have a mask on and employees do as well,” Freundel said. Hogan’s executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in stores and on transit went into effect Saturday, but Haines said many people at Walmart, customers and employees, began masking up weeks ago. “They’ve been handing out masks. They have the sneeze guards up at the pharmacy in the last week or so,” he said. “A lot of our cashiers have been wearing masks and gloves since the beginning.” The Westminster Walmart has also begun metering the number of customers coming into the store at a time, asking people to line up outside spaces marked by pink pieces of tape on the ground, six feet apart, and to follow unidirectional foot traffic flows through the stores aisles, marked similarly on the floor with tape. “You hear all the horror stories about what goes on in these stores, but I can honestly say our managers have been on top as you can be in terms of the sheer volume that comes in the store,” Haines said. “Everything gets wiped down. We close at 8:30, but the cashiers still work their regular shifts. So if they are scheduled until 10 p.m., midnight, they are staying and cleaning the font end for multiple hours.” And if store management has been good, so have customers, according to Tanzey. “They bring their gloves, they bring their masks. I have seen some retail horror stories but I have been blessed not to have any of those happen to me in the last couple of weeks,” she said. “I do receive more thank yous for coming to work than I ever have in my entire working career.” There are always horror stories working in retail, according to Haines, "but 95% or more of our customers have been very respectful,” he said. “I have heard personally and through other people a lot of appreciation from the customers. And even fellow co-workers to each other, those that are working more hours. I think everyone kind of understands this is a serious thing.” And what about the sudden spotlight on their profession? To be going from what has often been considered unskilled labor to being “essential” to even “heroes”? It’s not something that’s really been on Freundel’s radar. “Honestly I didn’t know. I was hearing stuff about it but I really don’t pay attention to the news,” she said. “I feel like I am just doing my job.” Haines also isn’t sure about being called a hero, but he said he does take pride in his work, and it’s nice to know that it’s being appreciated by others. “You don’t want to sound cliche and certainly hero is not the word I am going to throw around, but it is playing a role,” he said. “If that’s the little bit of normalcy I can give myself and give someone else before they have to spend the next 22 hours in their house with their family going nuts? That means something to me to be able to offer that.”

Dr. Darioush Nasseri, orthopedic surgeon at Baltimore’s Good Samaritan Hospital, dies of coronavirus
.W
Dr. Darioush Nasseri, a retired orthopedic surgeon who practiced at Good Samaritan Hospital, died April 11 of complications of the coronavirus. The former Lutherville resident was 84. His son, Kurosh Nasseri, said his father died at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda. Born in Iran, he was the son of Ali Asghar and Fatameh Nasseri. He attended Alborz High School in Tehran and earned an undergraduate degree at St. Andrews University in Scotland. He went on for additional study in orthopedics at the University of Bonn School of Medicine in Germany. His son said that while practicing medicine at Bonn, Dr. Nasseri and other physicians were part of the the team that pioneered an early hip transplant in the early 1970s. "His team traveled throughout the U.S. to lecture about the new procedure,” his son said. During this lecture tour, Dr. Nassei met Dr. David S. Hungerford, a Johns Hopkins orthopedic surgeon. They later became close friends. In 1973 Dr. Nasseri returned to Iran and established his orthopedic practice at the Shafa Orthopedics Hospital in Tehran. Several years later, Dr. Hungerford was part of a group of academic medical scholars visiting Iran, and he reconnected with Dr. Nasseri. During Christmas of 1978, Dr. Nasseri and his wife, Nina, came to the U.S. to visit their son, a student at American University in Washington, D.C. “It was also around that time that the political unrest in Iran was escalating dangerously, which led to the 1979 Islamic Revolution,” his son said. “My parents had to abandon their entire life while on holiday and never returned to their homeland in Iran.” In a speech Dr. Nasseri gave at his retirement, he said of that experience, “Essentially, we were forced to start life over again with little more than a suitcase each.” He later joked that he permanently borrowed his son’s car. He said that he was offered his old position at the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany, but his wife urged him to explore opportunities in the United States. “I was quite reluctant to do so because as a foreign doctor I would have to pass exams before being able to practice here,” he said in his talk. Dr. Nasseri said he was encouraged by a visit to the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where physicians said they had a place for him. “My father had to build his entire life over,” his son said. “His medical licenses were all from Germany and Iran, so he had to study for all of his exams again in order to be re-certified in the U.S. He accomplished this in 1981.” During this time he reconnected with Dr. Hungerford, who was on the Hopkins staff and who offered him a position in the Orthopedic Surgery Department. In 1981 Dr. Nasseri also joined the staff at Good Samaritan Hospital. Dr. Nasseri practiced at Johns Hopkins and later at MedStar Orthopedics/Good Samaritan Hospital until his retirement in 2016. In his retirement remarks, Dr. Nasseri said his time at the hospital “has truly been a pleasure, an honor and a privilege for me. I feel so privileged and humbled by the opportunities." A hospital biography said he was a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, fellowship-trained in joint replacement. He specialized in arthroscopic surgery for hip and knee replacements. He also worked in cartilage restoration techniques and took additional study at the Mayo Clinic and at hospitals in Russia and China. His son described his father: “He was a happy, caring person and was a mentor and supportive of his medical students. He was jovial and friendly and had a wide circle of friends." In 2014 Dr. Nasseri was given the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for his contributions to the field of orthopedics. Dr. Nasseri traveled extensively and was a fan of Formula One auto racing. He and his son attended the Canadian Grand Prix on several occasions. A memorial has been created in his name at the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 respond fund. Plans for a service are incomplete. Dr. Nasseri is survived by his wife of 62 years, Nina Shafazand, who worked with him in his medical practice and was earlier am attache at the Iranian Embassy in Bonn. In addition to his son, survivors include three grandchildren.

Absent traditional gatherings due to coronavirus, Maryland’s Orthodox Christians prepare for quieter Easter
.W
If this were a normal year, the Rev. Michael Pastrikos would lead a procession of thousands through the streets around his Baltimore church Friday night, then prepare himself for a dramatic service in a sanctuary full of people at midnight Saturday. Instead, the Greek Orthodox priest led his denomination’s traditional Epitaphios procession inside the church, accompanied by two cantors, and he’ll conduct the holiest services of the year nearly alone in an otherwise empty building. In this, his 14th and final year as pastor of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Highlandtown, Pastrikos will celebrate Orthodox Easter in a manner drastically out of keeping with his denominational tradition — without the company of celebrating throngs — and instead through the lens of a livestreaming camera. “I’ve been in the priesthood for 44 years, and I’ve never experienced anything like this, being this lonely in the church," Pastrikos said Friday between streaming services. “And [our worshipers] are sad and very lonely that they can’t be here in person to see everything that’s visible to them during Holy Week services.” "But we know that they are the church, they are the body of Christ — and we’re continuing to go with the flow.” Orthodox Christians observe Easter, the most sacred day on the Christian calendar, on Sunday, seven days after their fellow Christians in the United States did this year. The holy day comes a week later because Orthodox Christians follow the Julian calendar, one created by Julius Caesar in 56 B.C., not the Gregorian calendar many Western nations have observed since the late 1500s. Thanks to those calendars, Orthodox Easter can fall on any Sunday between April 4 and May 8, while Easter for Catholics and other Christians lands between March 22 and April 25. They overlap on rare occasions. The holidays represent the same thing — the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and the hope it embodies for believers. In Eastern Orthodox tradition, though, liturgical and cultural practices on Easter make generous use of tactile experience to connect believers to the divine, whether it’s Holy Week or not. Orthodox Christians — whether they’re part of Greek, Ukrainian, Antiochian, Ethiopian or Russian traditions, all of which are represented in the Baltimore area — venerate icons, or painted images of religious figures, by kissing or touching them, smell the aroma of incense in church, and enjoy feasts on special occasions, including in the early morning of Easter, or Pascha. So, when government officials mandated social distancing and limited gatherings to 10 people last month to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Orthodox churches obeyed. But it has caused considerable pangs. The spiritual leader Metropolitan Evangelos of the Metropolis of New Jersey, which governs parishes in Maryland, declared all churches closed after the World Health Organization designated the coronavirus crisis a pandemic. That left clergy to livestream services that normally call for attendance in person and, at times, hands-on involvement. Priests accustomed to pews full of faces, offering Holy Communion in person, and shaking hands to convey encouragement and blessings, found themselves delivering homilies and conducting liturgical rites, elaborately robed, from the altars of empty churches. The Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation in Baltimore, St. Mary Antiochian Church in Cockeysville, Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church in East Baltimore and Holy Cross Antiochian Orthodox Church in Linthicum and others have been livestreaming services for weeks and will do so this weekend and beyond. That pain of separation has been especially acute during Holy Week, which began with “Lazarus Saturday” last weekend and has continued with more than a dozen liturgies as the week unfolded. Pastrikos and St. Nicholas, one of four Greek Orthodox congregations in Baltimore, have gone online for the first time this year. As Holy Week has progressed, the 65-year-old priest said the webcasts have drawn between 900 and 1,200 viewers. The services, he said, have felt strange to perform, even physically taxing. Holy Week liturgies are meant to reflect for worshipers the experiences of Jesus Christ in the final days of his earthly life and ministry, from the hope represented by the resurrection of his friend, Lazarus, to the terror of his grisly death, to his removal from the cross and his triumphant ascent to heaven. In many cases, Orthodox Christians symbolically but physically reenact the events. On Great Friday, after the Royal Hours, a two- to three-hour service including chants and scriptural readings, priests perform the Apokathelosis service. They take a colorfully woven cloth that bears a representation of Christ’s body, or Epitaphios, down from a cross, place it in an elaborately decorated wooden bier known as a kouvouklion, and later that evening, help carry it outdoors in a procession of candle-carrying believers. Pastrikos, sexton Stanley Cavourus and cantor Demetrius “Jimmy” Apostolou performed the so-called Deposition of Christ in an otherwise empty sanctuary Friday afternoon. The event was livestreamed on YouTube via a link from the church’s website, with an array of icons visible in the background. They conducted the limited indoor procession Friday evening. The rite typically draws between 2,000 and 3,000 people. Because its regular Epitaphios is so heavy, the church devised a smaller one that Pastrikos and company carried this year. Early Friday, Pastrikos said he wasn’t expecting the rite to have its usual feel. And as for the Easter service — it traditionally begins in darkness, then culminates amid candlelight as worshipers cry “Christ is risen” — that, too, won’t feel quite the same. “You have to be in church to experience what it’s like, to see the faces, to feel the spiritual atmosphere everyone is in,” Pastrikos said. “And the ascension of Christ from the cross — you should see how emotional that is. It’s not the same [seeing it] on Facebook as when you see it in person.” In a typical year, up to 300 people cram the church for the remainder of the night, partaking of a Pascha feast that features eating lamb and cracking together traditional red-dyed eggs that symbolize both Christ’s death on the cross and the spiritual rebirth it’s believed to represent. This year, worshipers will feast more quietly, at home. Pastrikos is to retire this year, which means his last Holy Week and Pascha in Baltimore will be one where believers could not meet. A strange development, he said, but it strikes him as less of a hardship when he recalls how Ottoman Turks oppressed Greek Christians from the middle of the 15th century through 1832, when a Greek national state was established. During that period, many Greek Christians were forced to worship in their homes, and they kept the faith alive. He expects the same in 2020 in Baltimore and beyond. “We’ll miss that feeling of being in the Lord’s house,” he said. “But we’ll have it all back by this time next year.”

‘Right now, more than ever, people need cash’: A look inside a Laurel pawnshop during the coronavirus pandemic
.W
Lined up outside on black asphalt, a row of power tools and bicycles sat lonely. Nudged among them was a sole lawn mower. On the brick building behind them, a crew of five grass trimmers leaned against the wall, pointing upward to a large green sign that read Superpawn. Throughout an afternoon wave, five people showed up at the Laurel pawnshop solely to inquire about the lone lawn mower. Each person crouched and tiptoed in their own way to inspect the springtime necessity. One man reached out to grab the handle and quickly pulled his arms back to his chest, glancing side to side; it was a momentary lapse in thinking and a sign of the current times of living during the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly a month ago, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order closing nonessential businesses across the state. As a nonbank lender, pawnshops are able to keep their doors open. Superpawn manager Brad Wood wasn’t surprised pawnshops are allowed to stay open under Hogan’s order. He knows the necessity of them, especially now. “I know how many people come to us to make almost every month’s paycheck or every other month’s paycheck or when they don’t get enough hours,” said Wood, 32, of Ellicott City. “We’re the only people who are willing to help them. A bank is not going to give them money. Right now, more than ever, people need cash.” That need was exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, with nearly 297,000 people filing for unemployment in Maryland over the past month as businesses were forced to shutter. “Most of the people that need the unemployment [checks], the people who got laid off first, they’re not getting money and they can’t wait a couple more weeks so that’s why we’re here,” Wood said. “That’s the community that we serve.” Before the coronavirus, Superpawn owner Brad Kay said there wasn’t a time during the store’s regular 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. hours when at least three customers weren’t being helped. Regulars and newcomers alike were constantly roaming the aisles of the 4,000-square-foot shop. That is no longer Kay’s reality. Since he shut down his showroom at the end of March, an effort to keep employees and customers safe, business has naturally been slower. Kay, 52, has certain items lined up outside his store, things like the lonely lawn mower and other outdoor necessities that people may be looking for during the pandemic. Otherwise, he’s dependent on online sales and customers who pawn. At Superpawn, the five to six employees on shift at any given time wear masks and gloves when they interact with customers. Four gray plastic tables create a blockade outside the front door, preventing customers from entering the shop. Wood and other employees frequently remind customers to stay 6 feet apart. The store also now has reduced hours, open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday. “It’s still frightening, especially to be out in public, especially helping the public like we do,” Kay said. Kimp Grant, a regular customer, was back Wednesday, three days after he had pawned a computer. He returned to get it back, Grant’s way of supporting local businesses. “I know businesses around here are going to be suffering a lot,” Grant said. “I came up here, put something in and then brought it out to help them a little bit.” With Grant’s transaction, Superpawn was able to make money off the pawn fee charged for selling and buying back the item, usually about $15 per $100. Wood said pawn fees are crucial revenue during the pandemic. Kay said he has seen a spike in online sales. He’s offering customers “lightning fast shipping” and a 30-day money-back deal for anything bought online. Those offers help in all but one department. “You can’t really sell jewelry [online] typically. That’s one of the biggest hits,” Kay said. “That’s the kind of thing people like to look at personally and up close.” In person, however, jewelry has been a popular item to pawn, according to Wood. “People take [the wedding ring] off their finger [to pawn],” he said. “And once they get it back, they put it right back on their finger.” For Wood, those sales are heartbreaking. “It’s hard to go through a transaction like that and not feel,” Wood said, shaking his head. “That’s the only thing that they have that’s of intrinsic value, something that’s of value that they can get cash for to do what they need to do.”

Husband, wife workers at Upper Chesapeake Health make difficult choice to keep their children safe during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Working on the frontlines in the fight against the coronavirus is difficult enough. For University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health team members Alyson and David Schmidt it also meant making the hard, but ultimately best decision to remove their family from harm’s way. Since March 12, the Schmidts’ two children — 11-year-old Zackary and 6-year-old Marcelina — have been living with David’s parents in Strasburg, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley. Joining them were David’s 90-year-old grandfather, who had also been living in the Schmidts’ home in Street. Alyson is an Emergency Department tech at Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air. David works as a visitor management/security officer for UM Upper Chesapeake Health. The couple shares a deep commitment to providing the best care to the community, according to a release from the health system. They understand their roles as part of that commitment, including the long hours they are needed at work and how they may come into contact with patients who are experiencing coronavirus symptoms. “We are so fortunate to have team members who dedicate their lives — now and at all times — to keeping our community healthy and well. They provide compassionate care to all who seek it,” said Lyle E. Sheldon, president/CEO of University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, in a prepared statement. “The decision Alyson and David made to keep their children safe and well demonstrates their strong commitment to their family, to the community and to our patients. We commend them for their dedication and service.” Given their commitment to health care, the decision to send their children away still wasn’t an easy one. “We want to keep our community and our family safe,” Alyson said. “I could never put my children in harm’s way and will do anything to keep them safe.” Zack’s premature birth 11 years ago is a reason why the Schmidts want to keep their family well and protected. At his birth, three months earlier than expected, Zack’s lungs were underdeveloped. He remained in the hospital —first at UM St. Joseph Medical Center, where he was born, and then at University of Maryland Medical Center — for several months while undergoing multiple surgeries. During each challenge the Schmidts faced, they braced for the worst, but Zack was and is a fighter. Today he is a healthy fifth-grader at North Bend Elementary School. David and Alyson were so impressed with the health care team at University of Maryland Medical Center in downtown Baltimore and how committed they were to saving the life of their son that they gave up their careers in other fields to dedicate their lives to health care. Alyson and David don’t know when their children will come home or when they will see them in person again. Zack has a cell phone and texts his parents daily. When Alyson and David are both off in the evening, they FaceTime their children. Sometimes the four try to watch a movie together. "The best part of coming home after a long day at work is hugging your child, and you can't do that through a phone," Alyson said. She empathizes with folks in the community. “I have my good days, and I have my bad days,” Alyson said. On her days off she makes masks and caps to keep busy and to stay productive. Her advice to her fellow Harford residents during this time is simple. “Stay vigilant. Wash your hands. Stay home. Go out only when absolutely necessary,” she said.

Those addicted to heroin in Baltimore are being sent home with more methadone than ever amid the coronavirus pandemic
.W
More addiction-treatment medicine is being sent home with heroin addicts than ever before after state and federal regulators eased restrictions amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Authorities had limited take-home medicine to ensure it isn’t abused or sold on the streets. But providers say the change is necessary in this time of social distancing to thin the crowds that typically fill treatment centers. The Rev. Milton Emanuel Williams Jr. usually dispenses a daily dose of methadone or Suboxone from his East Baltimore clinic to each of his clients. Now, he’s sending addicts home with a pill bottle to last as long as 28 days. “We’re putting a lot of methadone and Suboxone on the street right now, which is a huge concern to me,” said Williams, who runs Turning Point Clinic, the biggest treatment center in Baltimore. “There are folks who can’t handle all this medication.” Williams and other treatment providers say they feel compelled to give out larger quantities of take-home medicine to reduce visits and protect patients and staff. Federal regulators issued new directives last month allowing the take-home doses to limit the person-to-person interactions that spread the virus. In normal times, Turning Point Clinic may treat more than 2,000 people in a day, Williams said. Now his staff wears gloves and masks to dispense methadone or Suboxone. “It’s almost impossible, in giving compassionate care, to not get close to people," he said. Treatment providers are bracing for a possible outbreak at Baltimore’s clinics and among vulnerable communities of recovering drug addicts. Most of these people are 45 to 55 years old and suffer chronic health problems, providers say. The virus has infected more than 8,200 people across Maryland and killed more than 200 of them, according to state figures. In addition, cases of COVID-19 have been reported at more than 90 nursing homes in Maryland. With the virus running rampant in Maryland, those who treat drug addiction in Baltimore are making difficult decisions to scale down services and protect their workers. In East Baltimore, the nonprofit Charm City Care Connection reduced hours at its drop-in center, a site for clean needles. The Baltimore City Health Department also slashed hours of its needle-exchange program. “People are having a much harder time getting clean syringes,” said Natanya Robinowitz, director of Charm City Care Connection. “People are just having to reuse multiple times or they’re having to share needles.” Robinowitz worries these conditions could lead to an outbreak of hepatitis C or HIV. Researchers have estimated 20,000 people in Baltimore are addicted to opioids, and the coronavirus has done little to disrupt the supply of heroin on the streets. A police commander and Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman both say the drug trade hasn’t slowed. Col. Richard Worley, the city’s chief of patrol, said drug dealers are even seen wearing protective face masks and gloves. Some drug treatment providers, however, notice signs the market may be changing. One heroin pill used to cost about $6 on the streets, said Dr. Yngvild Olsen, medical director for the Institutes for Behavior Resources Inc., which runs an addiction treatment center in Old Goucher. “I had a patient last week tell me that heroin now is $2 to $3 a pill,” she said. “One of the big questions is, what is happening with the drug supply?” Olsen said patients have told her the heroin is not just cheaper, but poorer quality and dirtier. In addition, the synthetic drug fentanyl — cheaper and more potent than heroin — had outpaced heroin on the streets, she said. Before the outbreak, as many as 120 people visited her clinic in a day. Her patients were crushed when staff made the difficult decision to stop group sessions and try counseling by phone, another step toward social distancing. “There has been significant concern that opioid treatment programs really could become hot spots for coronavirus," Olsen said. On March 16, federal regulators handed down new guidelines to states allowing clinics to send recovering addicts home with enough medicine to last them 14 or 28 days. Maryland officials are following the guidance, a state spokesman said. Previously, clinics gave out daily doses to new patients. Or patients had to spend long periods of time in treatment to qualify for take-home medicine. “Programs across the city are really weighing: How do we balance the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our patient population?” Olsen said, “and also balancing the risk of having more medication, like methadone, out in the community.” Methadone is dangerous for people without the tolerance of an opioid addiction; it could cause an overdose. The medicine also becomes dangerous if an addict is drinking alcohol or taking another prescription, say, Xanax. Methadone and Suboxone are smuggled into prisons and bought and sold on the streets. A 28-day supply could fetch as much as $2,000, said Williams, of Turning Point Clinic. “There’s probably 10 times more addicts not in treatment,” he said. “That’s why the demand for the medication is so high.” Some patients are selling their medicine or being robbed of it, Williams said, only to come back for more. Staff give such patients smaller doses more frequently, but person-to-person exchanges put everyone at risk. “It becomes a tough choice, a real tough choice,” Williams said.

Football stars Henry Poggi and Luke Casey had long road back from Italy amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
When former Atholton quarterback Luke Casey and Gilman tight end Henry Poggi went to play in the Italian Football League this season, they didn’t expect a pandemic to end their football careers prematurely. Coronavirus ravaged Italy, killing over 22,000 people and infecting nearly 170,000. While Casey and Poggi made it out of the country safely, it took a great deal of effort to make it home to the United States. Poggi, who starred at fullback at Michigan, played for the Ancona Dolphins on Italy’s Adriatic Coast. The closest major city to Ancona is Florence — about three hours away. As the virus began to bear down on the country, Poggi prepared to leave the country and fly back to America on March 27, but it wasn’t easy. “It was definitely an interesting experience getting back,” Poggi said. “Everything was shut down. We weren’t allowed to take our teammates or coaches or guys that run the team to drive us from Ancona to Rome. There were flights still leaving from Rome to the States during that time.” Usually in Italy, trains run all day, but Poggi and his other American teammates had to catch the one train leaving Ancona each day. He began his venture on Thursday from Ancona with his flight home to take place at 10 a.m. on Friday from Rome. Then came more red tape. “Our football club had to contact the police and they got us written permission to say ‘Here’s why we’re traveling’,” Poggi said. “The whole country was on a legitimately real shutdown where if you weren’t going to get groceries or you didn’t have a paper saying that you were an essential worker, you’d get fined. People really adhered to that and the only way there was for us to travel was if we had a document saying ‘We’re traveling. We’re Americans and we’re on our way to Rome to go home." Poggi, with a few of his teammates, got to the police station and had their documents checked. Then, came a 5-hour train ride to Rome, which included a stop in Fabriano, not too far outside of Ancona and another one in a smaller town. Arriving at 6 p.m., the last train into Rome was canceled. With his Italian not being up to snuff, one of the Italians traveling with Poggi stepped up and spoke to the police. “He talked to the police and they told us that it was going to come later,” Poggi said. "The train came about three hours later, but that train still wasn’t going all of the way into Rome, it was stopping about a 2-hour drive outside. The Italian government had closed all trains going in or out of Rome and really tried to isolate the city. “We had to get a 2-hour bus into Rome and after how difficult it was to get to Rome — getting to the airport and flying out was really easy. There was hardly anyone at the Rome airport at that time, it was only one flight coming in and 12 flights leaving all day.” After flying into John F. Kennedy Airport International Airport in Queens, New York, Poggi rented a car to drive to his brother’s house. He ended up staying there for a day in isolation and eventually drove to his family’s beach house in South Carolina. Casey was set to resume his career playing football in another European league, after playing last season for St. Ouen l’Aumône Cougars in France. Unfortunately for the former West Virginia Wesleyan quarterback, he never got a chance to suit for his newest team, the Lazio Ducks. “Everything felt really normal — I would assume just like in America — we had heard about it in China and it was heavy in the news,” Casey said. "So, we talked about it. Then, it kind of went away for awhile. It was a week or two I didn’t hear anything about the coronavirus. Next thing you know, the news starts talking about a spike in cases in Italy and it was in Northern Italy. Either way, the process was crazy. “One day, they started canceling schools. We worked at one of the schools in the area — a private school. We taught football to a class. Then we got a call one day that school was closed for two weeks. That was the start, we got school canceled and between all of the Americans we said ‘Wow, this is somewhat serious’. Then, the next day, our team president and the staff started telling us that we weren’t going to have practice." Things began to get hectic for Casey as every public field was closed and then many of the non-essential stores were closed. Within a span of five days, Italy became the grounds of a public health crisis. No one could leave their houses except to leave for the pharmacies or grocery stores. Casey ventured to the grocery store one night and there were a number of residents of the area gathered around the store. They donned masks and gloves and stood at least 10 feet away from one another. It took him about two hours to get groceries that day. However, it was all for naught, as his stay came to an untimely end. “Unfortunately, I actually left the next day,” Casey said. "I went out and got a whole bunch of food thinking I was going to hunker down and get ready for quarantine over there. In the morning, our general manager calls us and says that ‘If you want to stay, it’s up to you, but we got you guys a flight to get out of here in four hours. So, if you want to leave, you can leave in four hours. If you want to stay, that’s totally fine with us.’ “Between the six Americans [on the team], five of us left in that four hours of that phone call. We scrambled to get ready, which was pretty crazy, and we packed everything up and left. It was pretty sad, but it seemed necessary and felt like a good time to get home and be with your family. At the same time, we weren’t sure if we were going to have games or a season and didn’t want to let anyone down, but wanted to get home and be as safe as possible.” As he returned to the United States, Casey didn’t get tested or checked by anyone at the airport making for a “mind-boggling” experience. The night that he landed was his birthday — March 13. Once he got home, his parents made sure that he self-quarantined and he drove to a different house and stayed away from his family for 14 days. Luckily for Casey, he nor his team, ever developed any symptoms. This will be the end of Poggi’s playing career. He plans to coach, following in his father’s [St. Frances co-head coach Biff Poggi] footsteps. “I don’t think I’m going to head back, just because I was looking at it as a one-time experience,” he said. “My dad is a high school football coach. So, I definitely, 100%, eventually will be coaching high school football at some capacity at some point. Maybe not in the immediate future, but football is in my blood. At some it’ll happen sooner rather than later.” As for Casey, he won’t rule out the possibility of returning to play football in Europe. “My plans are to keep coaching — I’m going to coach at Archbishop Spalding,” Casey said. "Then, I’m working at the Quarterback Factory. I’ll probably just get a real job. I might be done playing in Europe, I don’t know. If they ask me to come back for another season, I’d love to, but if this thing is going to take up a few more months, I’m just going to coach and work locally here. “I may hang up the cleats, but if this thing gets sorted out, I’d love to play again. I’m just staying around football with coaching and hoping that it gets resolved so that I can get back to Italy as soon as possible.” Casey would like to see people take extra precautions in Maryland. “I think that we’re a little bit behind in the sense that we haven’t totally shut things down,” Casey said. "I hope that this thing doesn’t get as bad as it’s being predicted, but they’re talking about a bad spike coming up in America now. I think that Maryland should get to that point and I think [Gov.] Larry Hogan has done a great job, but I think that we’ll get locked down to the point that they are. If things keep spreading because people keep gathering and are in large groups, then I think that we’ll definitely get to the point where we are all locked down. "I just hope that it’s not for the whole summer. I hope that football happens — I hope that the NFL and college season won’t get interfered with. If we all stay in now and do our part and stay indoors, get outside get a little active, but stay away from other people and try not to spread this thing around, hopefully we can get past this and hopefully football can happen in the fall. Who knows.”

Citing economic hit from coronavirus, Gov. Hogan vetoes legislation to improve Maryland schools, allows Pimlico bill to become law 
.W
Citing the massive hit on Maryland’s economy from the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday vetoed several pieces of high-profile legislation that required additional spending ― including a sweeping overhaul of the state’s public schools and a funding increase to address inequities at historically black colleges and universities. The Republican governor, however, allowed legislation authorizing a rebuild of the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore to become law without his signature. “The General Assembly passed a number of bills worthy of consideration, but COVID-19 has caused sudden and unprecedented economic turmoil," Hogan said in a statement. “The impact from COVID-19 on state and local budgets, on small businesses, and on struggling Marylanders is devastating and is potentially worse than anything since the Great Depression.” Hogan’s vetoes ― which include legislation that would provide funding for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and to fight crime in the city ― were met with swift condemnation from legislative leaders. The governor’s veto of a $4 billion-a-year plan from the so-called Kirwan Commission to improve the state’s public schools means that another bill on school construction will not go into effect. A provision of the “Built to Learn Act," which provides $2.2 billion in extra funding for school construction, says it will not take effect until the Kirwan bill becomes law. “While we are in the midst of a public health and economic crisis of an extraordinary magnitude, stopping progress on education and school construction puts us even further behind," said House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, a Democrat. "We know that there are students across this state that are losing millions of hours of learning. The result of this shortsighted action is Maryland will continue to graduate students that are not ready for the real world.” The governor’s vetoes can delay implementation of bills, but Democrats in Maryland have long had enough legislative power to enact their agenda through veto overrides when the General Assembly meets again, typically in January. Jones said she and Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat, would consider their next steps. Should Democrats override the veto in January the governor’s action would have little lasting impact on the legislation because its early stages are already funded. In a session that ran just 71 days rather than the usual 90, Democratic lawmakers passed most of their priorities before quickly adjourning in March before the outbreak of the coronavirus in the state worsened. Ferguson and Jones had proclaimed education their top priority and pushed through landmark school-focused legislation, including $580 million to aid the state’s four historically black colleges and universities to settle a long-standing lawsuit alleging underfunding. Ferguson said he disagreed with Hogan’s vetoes, arguing some of those bills would help the state recover from the economic slowdown. “Instead of setting us on a path to a secure recovery, the governor is stopping all progress where it stands,” Ferguson said. "The governor had a choice today to reject traditional politics and work together to adjust shared visions and build a strong future after this crisis. Instead, he chose to foreclose hope, leaving Maryland families and historically black colleges and universities with an open question for the future.” The sweeping education reform bill, designed to restore the state’s public schools to among the best in the nation, was among the most hotly debated of the legislative session. The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future includes a variety of programs designed to significantly improve public schools, ranging from offering expanded prekindergarten to children from poor families to paying teachers more to improving supports at schools with high concentrations of students from low-income households. The programs were recommended by the Kirwan Commission, which studied ways to improve academic performance. While six GOP senators voted for the legislation, House Republicans fought the proposals bitterly, arguing they would cost taxpayers $32 billion over 10 years without a clear way to pay for them. Democrats agreed to amend the bill to halt the reforms in a bad economy or if they’re not working. Baltimore County elementary school teacher and Maryland State Education Association President Cheryl Bost said Hogan’s veto of the Kirwan legislation is hopefully but a speed bump to its enactment. “The governor’s veto is a disappointing but hopefully temporary setback," said Bost, the teachers’ union president. "We urge the overwhelming number of legislators from both parties who voted for the Blueprint to override the veto at the next session of the legislature so we can deliver the support to our students that they desperately need.” William E. “Brit” Kirwan, who chaired the commission whose work led to the bill, said he was “very disappointed” the governor vetoed the bill. He said the closure of school buildings due to the coronavirus pandemic has underscored the need to improve public schools. Kirwan, who is a former University System of Maryland chancellor and math professor, said the veto sends “an unfortunate message” that education is not a priority. “Who has suffered in this period?” he asked. “A lot of people have, including children whose educational opportunities have been severely impacted. What an opportunity that has now been missed to send a signal that education matters.” Hogan also vetoed new taxes Democrats had designed to pay for the school proposals, including proposed levies on digital advertising, digital downloads and vaping, and an increase to the tax on tobacco. Together, the taxes would raise more than $400 million a year, analysts say, and pay for the first five years of implementing the school improvements. Rebecca Snyder, director the MDDC Press Association, and others thanked the governor in a statement for vetoing the tax on digital advertising, which she said would hurt local media companies. “This legislation would have hobbled businesses who are already on the ropes due to the COVID-19 outbreak," Snyder and advocates for digital advertising companies wrote. Hogan also vetoed legislation to send more resources to the city to fight crime, blocking a bill to provide about $12 million to Baltimore for law enforcement in 10 high-crime “microzones," mandate increased oversight of offenders on parole or probation, and authorize state police traffic patrols to free up city officers to investigate crimes. Another bill he vetoed would mandate spending on violence-interruption programs, such as Safe Streets or Roca. “I’m disappointed. We had some good proposals that we sent to the governor’s desk,” said Del. Luke Clippinger, a Baltimore Democrat who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. “A lot of the bills he vetoed would have had an impact on crime in a holistic manner. We need resources on the ground in our most violent neighborhoods." The governor also vetoed legislation that would have given $5.5 million in state aid to the financially struggling Baltimore Symphony Orchestra over five years. The BSO’s management and players said even without additional aid from the state, their multiyear plan to achieve financial stability is not doomed. The Symphony wasn’t scheduled to receive the first, $1.5 million installment of funds until Sept. 1, 2021. That gives the orchestra 15 months to either persuade legislators to override the governor’s veto or to come up with an alternate plan. “We understand the hesitation to move forward at this time due to the unprecedented uncertainty surrounding COVID-19,” Peter Kjome, the BSO’s president and CEO wrote in an email. “We are hopeful that there will be an opportunity for a different outcome when the General Assembly reconvenes.” The governor did, however, permit the bill to become law that is aimed at facilitating redevelopment of Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore and the Laurel Park track. It authorizes the Maryland Stadium Authority to issue up to $375 million in bonds, which would be paid back through casino proceeds already earmarked to subsidize the racing industry and through the Maryland Lottery. “This is truly a defining moment in the history of the Maryland thoroughbred racing industry and the state, and we are most appreciative,” said Alan M. Rikin, attorney for the Maryland Jockey Club and Preakness Stakes. Hogan’s vetoes come as he’s imposed a budget freeze while the state continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic that has infected nearly 30,000 Marylanders. More than 1,300 people have died in the state. In one worst-case scenario developed by the comptroller’s office, the state could lose out on $2.8 billion in expected revenue by the end of June if the governor’s stay-at-home order remains in place that long. Maryland saw another jump in unemployment claims last week as nearly 110,000 residents filed for assistance after the state allowed independent contractors and gig workers to file for the aid late last month. “Given these challenges, it would be irresponsible to allow legislation that requires increasing spending to become law,” Hogan said.

A slow start to coronavirus distance-learning for schools in Maryland | COMMENTARY
.W
If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the novel coronavirus sweeping the globe, it’s that swift action is critical to not only stem the spread of the virus, but to adequately prepare for life amid stay-home orders and business shutdowns, as well as whatever comes beyond. Americans who stockpiled toilet paper in early March, to mockery from the rest of us, for example, are rightfully smug today. But while Maryland has largely been a leader in U.S. pandemic preparedness, forming an early team of medical advisors and declaring a state of emergency a week before the president, there’s one area in which we lagged behind: the so-called “distance learning” that’s supposed to stand in for our children’s classroom education. A report released earlier this month by the Teaching Systems Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that Maryland was slow to offer certain guidance regarding remote education in the final days of March — a critical time when all 50 states had shuttered public schools at least temporarily in an effort to slow the infection rate (Maryland closed its schools on March 16th). Of 21 criteria outlined in the report, “Remote Learning Guidance from State Education Agencies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A First Look,” Maryland had met only three by March 31, coming in dead last. Texas appeared the best prepared by MIT’s measures, which looked at whether remote learning guidance was available, along with key recommendations for instruction, and plans for dealing with equity and access to technology issues. That state had 17 such conditions in place at the time, followed by Massachusetts, New York and Tennessee, each with 16. Since then, Maryland has added several criteria (up to seven out of 21), and a report author has recently warned against “inferring that an absence of guidance from a particular state on a particular issue represents an absence of concern from those state policymakers.” But coming in last in the early days raises concerns about how much catch-up we’re playing now, particularly as other states make longer term plans for education. At least 39 states have made the call to officially keep their school buildings closed through the remainder of the school year, focusing completely on distance learning. Thus far, Maryland has only conceded that classes will not be held before mid-May. That paves the way for piecemeal planning. When schools were first shuttered March 16th, they were to remain closed through March 27. That was later changed to April 24th. And last week, it was changed again to May 15th. The extensions have the feel of buying time. In a statement issued Friday, State Superintendent of Schools Karen B. Salmon said school systems will use the weeks between now and the 15th “to examine every option and continue to develop a long-term plan for recovery.” They will also submit learning plans, if they haven’t already, that address the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, give a sample teacher and student day, and offer a plan of accountability and professional development for staff, along with a description of how the system will handle equity issues. We would have expected that to be happening in earnest six weeks ago, when schools were first shuttered. Twelve states had sample syllabi in place by the end of March, according to the MIT report, and 35 had statements about digital versus non-digital learning opportunities; MIT found neither in Maryland. We understand that online education is never going to be as good as classroom learning, particularly for kids who were struggling before now, and that there are enormous difficulties in pulling together meaningful programs at a moment’s notice, especially with resources and funding in flux. But the stakes could not be higher. The Maryland General Assembly spent most of the legislative session (before it, too, was cut short) driving home the need for billions-of-dollars-worth of sweeping education reform in the state and painting a dire picture of how far behind our children already are. Those kids deserve our best efforts at every point along the way; they will not get this time back. Superintendent Salmon seems to understand the state is in for a long transitional period, even without yet shuttering schools for the academic year. In her statement, she mentions potential “plans for additional digital learning and the recovery of any lost instructional time in the form of expanding summer school programs.” We’ll take that as a sign a lesson has been learned.

Bus Stop is open: Couple starts ice cream business in Upperco amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Two Carroll County natives had always wanted to join the food service industry. Given an opportunity, they weren’t going to let the coronavirus pandemic stop them. Jeff and Brooke Schnoor, 2019 Carroll Biz Challenge fan favorites with their Drifting Dreamers photo booth, undertook a new business venture, featuring ice cream and snowballs. Their new business, the Bus Stop, held its grand opening on Friday. Formerly known as the Sundae Shack, the Bus Stop is in Spring Meadows Station in Upperco, neighboring other businesses. The owners plan to incorporate their photo booth, which the couple operates out of their 1963 Volkswagen van, into the Bus Stop. “The bus will be a fixture there and once COVID-19 is over and people can get close again, we’ll be putting the photo booth back into the bus and people can have their pictures taken when they come and buy produce from the plant area, ice cream from us or even buy the barbecue from the pit beef stand," said Brooke. Jeff and Brooke have wanted to start an ice cream stand for quite some time. “After the Carroll Business Challenge, we were considering turning the bus into some sort of food truck but it just never worked out that way,” said Brooke. “We love food service and customer service in general so we’ve always dabbled in different food ideas and we would love to do a mobile food truck but this just kind of fell into our laps.” They didn’t anticipate they would be able to open until the summer due to the pandemic. It wasn’t until last week that they knew they would open in April. The biggest fear they have with starting their business during a pandemic is gaining too much attention that could affect the safety of others. " I would say the hardest thing is really being safe and still having a small business," said Brooke. “We don’t want cars and a line out the wazoo to make it look like we’re encouraging people to come out. It’s just hard. It’s like we want everyone to be safe and not come out but we also know essential means different things for different people.” They have been getting a lot of support from the community with excitement for their opening making them believe they will have a pretty busy turnout. “People are pulling in constantly to Spring Meadow because they just want to get out and they’re out driving around and they see something,” said Brooke. “I think, too, because it’s an open air farm, everyone just is like 'oh, it’s fine to just walk around. So, I personally think we’re going to be very busy.” They owners plan to add some twists to their menu by partnering with other local businesses. For example, they say they will have a donut sundae to be offered on Sundays, featuring donuts from Bertucco’s Bakery in Hampstead. Hours have not yet been finalized because the Schnoors don’t know what to expect in terms of daily turnout amid a pandemic. They pledged to keep customers posted trough their Facebook page. The Bus Stop offers pick-up and delivery and customers will be able to keep their distance by putting in an order beforehand and having it brought to their car. To keep themselves and their customers safe, the duo spent a lot of time cleaning leading up to the opening. “We’ve been taking turns going there and just cleaning it and cleaning it and cleaning it,” Jeff said. Jeff and Brooke thought this would be a venture they could take on on their own but as the parents of three young girls, they realized they would need a staff. “So we had not had the conversation about staff at all and then I was very much like, ‘Oh, we can go just Jeff and I,'" said Brooke. "Then we made the announcement ... and the amount of Facebook response we got to people saying they couldn’t wait to see us. We then realized we don’t think we have any staff lined up to work other than Jeff and I, and we have three small children.” They have protocols in place to keep any new employee safe. “Everyone’s going to be wearing the face masks and gloves,” said Jeff. “The advantage of the building is we have an order window and we have a receiving window. So, for them, we’ll have someone at one window, someone making and the someone delivering.” As parents and business owners, they also have to deal with finding childcare while they work during the pandemic due to fears of spreading the virus. “That is a struggle too, just finding a sitter that we know is not around a lot of people for just us and our families," said Brooke. "So, it’s a full challenge all around for small businesses but you also don’t want to miss the opportunity to be able to be out there.”

Carroll Cares helping residents of retirement communities get supplies during coronavirus crisis
.W
A local organization is helping members of an independent living community get the essential supplies they need amid the coronavirus closures and restrictions. Carroll Cares, started by Eldersburg resident Shawn Guzzo, has been getting supplies for members of Winifred Manor, a 55 and over independent living community. Volunteers for Carroll Cares pick up items twice a week from the grocery store, the pharmacy and liquor store for residents of Winifred Manor. Debbie Thompson, the property manager of Winifred Manor, encouraged the organization and its benefit toward the seniors. “We would like to help out the seniors in any way we can,” said Thompson. “She [Guzzo] has a great system set up.” Guzzo, whose mother lives at Winifred Manor, got the idea to start Carroll Cares after realizing the risks for older people to run these errands on their own. Some of Guzzo’s friends wanted to do something to help in this time of uncertainty for many. “So what they’ll do is they’ll call me and they ask more questions about it, and we put them on a spreadsheet," Guzzo said. "So we asked them to put their grocery lists in an envelope with their name and their phone number. We picked it up so we don’t have to go in and see them. We go into the little vestibule, pick it up, we go do their shopping.” The organization started doing their deliveries two weeks ago. According to Guzzo, a Carroll Cares volunteer did the organization’s first delivery for The Village, another 55 and over independent living community, some 10 days ago and will do more orders if there is a high demand. Thompson said orders are picking up due to the stay-at-home order of Gov. Larry Hogan issued last Monday. As safety precautions, Carroll Cares volunteers take disinfectant, they wear gloves and they disinfect the products before they drop them off. They place the customer’s change and receipt back in the envelope, but some customers pay with a check after their groceries are dropped off. “We ring their buzzer and put it outside their door, so there’s no human contact,” said Guzzo. About 12 people from the community have signed up for deliveries from and they are grateful to be able to get needed supplies in a time like this, according to Guzzo. “Everybody’s saying the same thing, they are just very appreciative and they’re just happy to have somebody that’s willing to go out for them because they’re scared,” said Guzzo. Guzzo said they have enough volunteers for the amount of deliveries they do now but if demand picks up then they will need more volunteers. Thompson, who also helps the organization, said the service is helpful for those who don’t have family members nearby to run the errands for them. “A lot of people have family members, but they’re unable to get there for one reason or another,” said Thompson. “So this has been a really, really helpful thing for the seniors because our average age is 80 years old. For example, the lady that I’m picking up for now, her daughter’s a nurse and that’s her only child and she’s probably about 45 to 50 minutes away. So for her to get off work and come here and do these types of things, it’s really hard for the kids.”

Baltimore Police Northeast District detective tests positive for coronavirus, bringing department total to 9
.W
Baltimore Police said a detective assigned to the Northeastern District tested positive for the coronavivrus, bringing the department total to nine. Department spokeswoman Lindsey Eldridge said the detective had already been off of work for a week while awaiting COVID-19 test results. “The department takes these cases very serious and continues to undertake all the necessary precautions to include cleaning and sanitizing work spaces and buildings,” Eldridge said. “We will continue to follow the recommendations of health officials within the Baltimore City Health Department and other public health experts, to include the CDC.” Last week, the department’s Southwest district was closed for several days for a deep cleaning after an employee tested positive. In addition to the detective, six officers and two civilian employees have tested positive for the coronavirus. As of Monday, the department said 94 officers have been cleared to return to work while 40 Southwest District officers continue to self-quarantine. There are 120 officers throughout the department who are self-quarantined.

Baltimore to screen people staying in homeless shelters for coronavirus, give them space to isolate
.W
To help control an outbreak of the new coronavirus among Baltimore’s homeless families, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young outlined an extensive plan Wednesday for screening people staying in emergency shelters and giving them space to spread out and isolate. Young’s plan comes amid concerns the virus could spread widely through shelters and encampments, where people gather in large groups and frequently have chronic health conditions. Young said the Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services will work in partnership with service providers and public and private agencies to execute the plan. “We must protect our homeless neighbors and mitigate their risk of infection the same way we do the rest of the city’s residents," Young said in a statement. "In most cases, this means providing them access for testing and space to self-isolate, if needed. Our homeless neighbors are a part of this city and if we don’t protect them we leave our city exposed to greater risk.” The plan was well-received by Baltimore service providers, who they were encouraged by the scope of the city’s response. Anyone entering one of the city’s emergency shelters is screened by the staff for symptoms of the virus. If they show symptoms, the shelter staff will reach out to a health care provider for a secondary screening over the phone. In the case of a positive screening, the person will receive a referral for official testing and be transported to an isolated site. There have not been any confirmed cases or positive tests for coronavirus among those staying in city shelters, officials said. The city also has put into place guidance for hospitals before they discharge someone experiencing homelessness. Under the protocol, hospital workers are to check on whether their patient has a home to return to. If he or she does not have a home, accommodations should be made for them depending on if they have tested positive or negative or if they’re waiting for results. When a person is given an isolated place to stay, the Mayor’s Office of Homeless Services will remain in contact with them and assess their ongoing needs. In some cases, people will be given hotel rooms where they can recover or wait for their test results. The mayor’s office also plans to activate another shelter that will allow for the recommended social distancing space between people. Officials continue to look for additional spaces to add to the shelter system, as emergency shelters are nearly filled to capacity. For people who sleep outside, the city’s homeless outreach teams are distributing supplies, including water, toiletries and food. Carolyn Johnson, managing attorney for the Homeless Persons Representation Project, said Baltimore’s strategy is similar to ones deployed in places, such as Seattle, with large populations of unhoused people. While some details are still being sorted out, Johnson said the plan shows the city is taking the risk seriously and planning accordingly. “One thing that’s clear to me is that these are large undertakings and the city will need state and federal resources,” Johnson said. “We haven’t heard a lot on the state level on a plan for the health needs of unhoused people throughout the state. It seems to be falling on the local jurisdictions.” At Health Care for the Homeless, president Kevin Lindamood said the city is demonstrating strong leadership on the pandemic by putting in place steps to slow its spread to “the most vulnerable and medically fragile members of our community.” The city’s approach follows many best practices, such as spacing out people inside the shelters and asking hospital workers to ask people about their housing situation before they’re discharged. “From our vantage point, every sector of the city has worked around the clock under challenging circumstances to stand up a system of identification, testing, transportation, and isolation for people experiencing homelessness — before the point of mass community spread,” he said. Lindamood said to follow the city’s lead, state and federal leaders need to step up on behalf of the homelessness community so Baltimore and other communities have the resources needed to serve their vulnerable neighbors. “So many partners in this plan are themselves treading water,” he said. "We face shrinking workforces and diminishing supplies. The vision and commitment are there. And we all need reinforcements to make this work.”

President Trump declares major disaster in Maryland due to coronavirus, releasing funds after request from Gov. Larry Hogan 
.W
President Donald Trump released more funding to Maryland on Thursday night after declaring that a major disaster exists in the state amid the coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Larry Hogan said the funding comes hours after a phone call with the president and other White House officials where he pushed for disaster declarations. Maryland senators also wrote a letter to Trump on Wednesday, asking him to grant the disaster declaration request from Hogan because the state and local jurisdictions had already worked together to release additional funding for the coronavirus response. With the declaration of a major disaster in the state, Maryland will be eligible for reimbursement for the Emergency Protective Measures taken by state and local government agencies and certain nonprofit groups. It also provides a wide range of federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said, including money for both emergency and permanent work. “We are pleased that our federal partners answered our calls for action and swiftly granted Maryland’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration,” the Republican governor said in a statement. “This declaration will help provide much-needed funding for state and local governments and nonprofits, and it will be another important step in Maryland’s aggressive and coordinated response to COVID-19.” Trump, a Republican, granted the same requests to several other states, including Missouri and Illinois. Maryland could potentially receive more funding if further assessments demonstrate a need and Hogan requests it, the White House said. Hogan’s request comes after Maryland reported 580 confirmed cases of COVID-19, jumping 157 cases over a 24-hour period. The number of confirmed cases in the National Capital Region has quadrupled over the past week, the governor’s office said. As chairman of the National Governors Association, Hogan also continued to press for further action on the five requests he submitted to the president and Vice President Mike Pence last week: Dedicate at least 50 percent of supplemental funding to the states, including direct funding, and act quickly on waiver requests  Increase access to PPE, masks, test kits, extraction kits, and accelerating the production of life-saving equipment, such as ventilators  Support Title 32 authorization to give governors maximum flexibility for use of the National Guard  Provide guidance on implementation of Defense Production Act to include what health and medical resources Secretary of Health and Human Services Azar is prioritizing under his new authority  Allow more time and flexibility for completion of both the census and the transition to REAL ID To help secure the federal funding, Hogan was required to prove the severity of COVID-19 across Maryland as well as demonstrate the amount of state and local resources that have been or will be committed to help resolve the pandemic, according to FEMA. Hogan then had to provide an estimate of the type and amount of assistance needed. The governor also committed that state and local government will help cover “significant proportions,” FEMA said, and will “comply with all applicable cost-sharing requirements.” Major disaster declarations are usually reserved for storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. However, the declaration can be made by the president for any event that “has caused damage of such severity that it is beyond the combined capabilities of state and local governments to respond.” “The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on our entire state and country unlike anything we have seen before,” said Russell Strickland, executive director for the Maryland Emergency Management Agency. “We have been working alongside Governor Hogan and our local partners to ensure the continued safety and wellbeing of all Marylanders. This declaration is an important and necessary step to continue on our path of resilience.”

U.S. businesses are not villains in the coronavirus economy | READER COMMENTARY
.W
I commend, as others have, the great work that The Baltimore Sun has performed with the coverage of the pandemic. It has been so inspiring to observe the countless acts of selflessness, courage and leadership exhibited by both organizations and individuals as we navigate through this pandemic crisis. In the midst of witnessing the power of the human spirit, I was incensed by the commentary written by Robert Reich (“Corporations are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic,” March 24). Mr. Reich wants the reader to conclude that avaricious U.S. companies are exploiting this pandemic. His discursive rant about Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the airlines, stock buybacks and worker benefits are used as fodder to prove his point. There was an opportunity for Mr. Reich to present a more balanced view of how U.S. businesses are helping us all through this health crisis. A few notable examples among thousands are the alcohol companies making hand sanitizer, Ford partnering with 3M to make respirators, Unilever delivering soap, sanitizer, bleach and food for charities, and Nike and the Gap working with their factories to make masks and other equipment. Mr. Reich’s training is in economics, not in social justice advocacy. He should stick to his knitting. Introductory economics textbooks assert that in a supply-driven crisis like we are experiencing, it is critical that all businesses have the liquidity they need to stay afloat to mitigate job reductions. Federal government administered check writing schemes, although politically popular, didn’t work under Barack Obama or George W. Bush. The most vulnerable, those who are the lower end of the economic spectrum, need their jobs back. I would encourage Mr. Reich to embrace the work of Tyler Cohen, an economist who does stick to his knitting. One of his most convincing quotes is “All of the criticisms one might mount against the corporate form — some of which are valid — pale in contrast to two straightforward and indeed essential virtues. First, business makes most of the stuff we enjoy and consume. Second, business is what gives most of us jobs.” Let’s recognize the fact that U.S. businesses are huge contributors to the betterment of our society and our economy. Why is it the case that certain politicians and academics are looking to exploit and sully corporations during this pandemic?

Maryland education department to issue grants to child care providers facing financial stress due to coronavirus
.W
The Maryland State Department of Education will offer relief to child care providers serving the children of essential workers in the state in the form of a one-time grant. In a statement, the department said providers will each receive a $2,000 payment by next week. It also pledged to offer “seamless, prompt” reimbursements to providers in coordination with the Maryland comptroller’s General Accounting Division. The announcement comes as providers criticize the state’s handling of their business since the coronavirus forced schools to close through at least mid-May. The state made an exception for licensed child care providers, who can stay open, but only for the children of essential workers, who do not have to pay for their kids to attend. This leaves gaping holes in revenue, providers told The Baltimore Sun. Some have closed their doors, unable to pay the bills and uncertain if they can recover when the virus abates. Others have continued to provide in-person care and virtual lessons, accumulating debt and seeking full or partial tuition from the families of nonessential workers and requesting donations of supplies and snacks. Maryland State Schools Superintendent Karen B. Salmon said providers should be flexible in honoring contract provisions, but the state has not issued firm guidance on whether providers can charge anything. Although providers can submit reimbursement invoices to the state education department every two weeks, some said the money does not cover the ongoing costs — particularly for those used to being paid weekly by parents — and does not reach their bank accounts quickly enough. The state is currently reimbursing centers at a rate of $350 per week for children 6 weeks old to 3 years old and $250 a week for kids ages 3 to 13 — which can be less than the weekly cost of child care in the most expensive parts of the state. In the statement, Salmon said false information circulated on social media accusing the comptroller’s office of delaying provider payments. “We regret that the Comptroller’s role in this process has been mischaracterized," Salmon said. “The Comptroller’s Office, as has always been the case on matters such as this, has been exceptionally responsive, providing us with all of the information we need to authorize reimbursements.” She also said the state education department has worked diligently to ensure child care services “are delivered in accordance with the standards that Maryland families deserve.” "We remain deeply grateful to our providers who are doing so much to ease the burden on our state’s essential workers,” she said.

In a hurry, Maryland legislature passes bills to improve schools, help racetracks, add benefits for those hurt by coronavirus 
.W
For the first time since the Civil War, Maryland lawmakers cut short their annual session Wednesday after passing sweeping reforms to education, a plan to rebuild the Pimlico Race Course and emergency legislation to address the spread of the coronavirus. The education reform bill would pump billions more into public schools, raising teacher pay, expanding pre-kindergarten and boosting vocational training programs. The racecourse legislation would authorize $375 million in bonds to renovate Maryland horse-racing tracks and keep the storied Preakness in Baltimore. And the legislature expanded temporary unemployment benefits to help those who lose their jobs or can’t work because of the virus. The pandemic that has infected dozens of Marylanders prompted an intense rush to get things done after Senate President Bill Ferguson and House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones announced Sunday that the session, which typically runs 90 days, would end almost three weeks early. At that point, lawmakers had passed just three bills through both chambers. As the General Assembly closed Wednesday, more than 660 bills had passed, including emergency legislation to help the state confront the public health crisis and a plan for a statewide referendum on sports betting. “We came here to do a job,” Ferguson said. “It’s been difficult and hard, but there are Marylanders out there right now who are trying to figure out how they will make it through the next month.” It was Ferguson’s and Jones’ first time leading the legislature after the long tenures of two political legends: former Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, who stepped down from his leadership post as he fights cancer, and the late House Speaker Michael Busch. Jones said it was “sort of a relief” to adjourn the session Wednesday. “It was sometimes grueling, but at the same time we knew we had to get as much done as we could in the circumstances we had,” Jones said. Facing the health crisis, lawmakers worked through the weekend and late into the evening Monday and Tuesday to condense the final three weeks of session into three days. Ferguson said the lawmakers planned to reconvene in late May to finish any “critical” business left unfinished by the session’s premature end. In just 71 days, Democratic lawmakers passed most of their priorities. Ferguson and Jones had proclaimed education their top priority and pushed through a $4 billion-a-year plan to improve learning in the state’s public schools, a $2.2 billion boost to school construction projects, and $580 million to aid the state’s four historically black colleges and universities. “This is a really challenging moment, but it will be temporary," Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said of the health crisis. Two senators were absent for the final day. Miller — who resigned as the chamber’s president after 33 years but continues to represent his district — was hospitalized with back pain and a mouth infection. Ferguson said he spoke with Miller by phone Wednesday and the Calvert County Democrat lived up to his reputation for feistiness. Miller relayed that he’s been telling his doctors to “get me the hell out of here," Ferguson said. Also absent was Sen. Paul Pinsky, a Prince George’s County Democrat who led the Kirwan Commission education legislation through the Senate. After shepherding the bill, Pinsky rushed home to be with his wife, Joan Rothgeb, a longtime education advocate who died of cancer Tuesday. Senators adjourned their Tuesday session in her honor. The legislature, controlled by Democrats, moved three bills to address the coronavirus pandemic, including authorizing Republican Gov. Larry Hogan to draw up to $100 million from the state’s “rainy day” fund and extending temporary unemployment benefits to those who lose or leave their jobs because of the public health crisis. The legislation allows the state to extend temporary unemployment benefits to workers who have to be quarantined or whose employers temporarily close. The legislation also makes people eligible for benefits when they have to leave their jobs due to risk of exposure or to care for an infected relative. The bill takes other steps to address the pandemic’s impact in Maryland. It will cut costs for screening tests, improve access to telehealth services, prohibit price gouging and make it illegal for an employer to fire a worker because he or she is quarantined. The governor is expected to sign the measure, which will then take effect immediately. The legislation was one of three priorities Hogan asked the legislature to complete before adjourning. The others ― also completed by lawmakers ― were confirming Woodrow J. Jones as superintendent of the Maryland State Police and passing the state’s $47.9 billion operating budget. Many new laws flew through the legislature in the final days, with whole batches of bills receiving unanimous votes in succession without controversy or discussion. But the sweeping education reform bill, designed to restore the state’s public schools to among the best in the nation, proved among the most controversial of the session. The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future includes a variety of programs designed to significantly improve public schools, ranging from expanding prekindergarten for children from poor families to paying teachers more to improving supports at schools with high concentrations of students from low-income households. The programs were recommended by the Kirwan Commission, which studied ways to improve academic performance in the state’s schools. The programs carry an eventual cost of nearly $4 billion per year at full implementation in 2030, which would be paid by the state and local governments. While six GOP senators voted for the legislation, House Republicans fought the proposals bitterly, arguing they would cost taxpayers $32 billion over 10 years without a clear way to pay for them. Democrats agreed to amend the bill to halt the reforms in a bad economy or if they’re not working. Democrats also pushed through new taxes on digital advertising, digital downloads, vaping and an increase to the tax on tobacco. Together, the taxes would raise more than $400 million a year, analysts say, and pay for the first five years of implementing the school improvements. Hogan has opposed the legislation and the taxes needed to pay for it, but has not said if he will veto the measures. Lawmakers also put the finishing touches on a bill that would facilitate the redevelopment of Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore and the Laurel Park track. The Maryland Stadium Authority would issue up to $375 million in bonds, which would be paid back through casino proceeds already earmarked to subsidize the racing industry and through the Maryland Lottery. Belinda Stronach, president of The Stronach Group that owns the two tracks, praised lawmakers for their work, which she said will lead to an “enhanced Preakness in Baltimore.” “Their tireless efforts, particularly as they work to prioritize the health and well-being of Maryland’s citizens during these difficult times, is highly commendable,” Stronach said in a statement. Hogan has said he supports keeping the Preakness race in Baltimore, but — as with many bills — has declined to say whether he supports the legislation. The governor can choose to sign or veto bills or allow them to become law without his signature. The Assembly passed several bills aimed at improving health care in Maryland: protecting provisions of the Affordable Care Act and mandating that colleges and universities create plans to address the outbreak of infectious diseases. The latter was prompted by the death of University of Maryland freshman Olivia Paregol from an adenovirus. On the final day of the session, lawmakers also passed a constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would give the General Assembly power to move money around within the state budget. Currently, legislators can cut the budget, but can’t reallocate that money to other areas. Republicans complained the proposed amendment was rammed through the legislature in the final hours of the shortened session, when the public was banned from the State House campus for health reasons and there were problems with online video and audio feeds of the proceedings. Del. Nic Kipke, an Anne Arundel County Republican who is the House minority leader, questioned the wisdom of considering the amendment during “the worst health crisis in all of our lifetime.” “We’re in this chamber, stuck here. Who knows who has coronavirus? It could be any of us. We could be out of here already … Instead, we are passing unnecessary things like this,” he said. Supporters of the amendment said it would give Maryland lawmakers the same budgetary authority their counterparts in the other 49 states have. The amendment, if approved, would go into effect for the next governor, so it would not curtail Hogan’s powers. The coronavirus emerged as a crisis near the end of the session. Before that, Hogan had urged the legislature to pass bills to address another crisis: the persistent violence in Baltimore. While the Senate passed a version of Hogan’s “Violent Firearms Offenders Act” ― which called for longer sentences for repeat gun offenders ― that bill failed in the House. But the Assembly passed legislation to send more resources to the city to fight crime, backing a bill to provide about $12 million more in law enforcement resources to Baltimore by creating 10 high-crime “microzones," mandate increased oversight of offenders on parole or probation, and authorize state police traffic patrols in Baltimore to free up city officers to investigate crimes. Another bill would mandate spending on violence interruption programs, such as Safe Streets or Roca. While Hogan counted some legislative victories, much of the Republican governor’s agenda met with defeat, including a proposed tax break for retirees, redistricting reform and mandating school to start after Labor Day. Many bills backed by Democrats failed, as well, including proposals to ban plastic bags in the state and allow victims of child abuse more time to sue their alleged abusers.

New Windsor provides coronavirus updates in first virtual town council meeting
.W
New Windsor’s first virtual town council meeting focused on providing updates on changes in procedure amid the coronavirus crisis. Mayor Neal Roop started the meeting by explaining that they are keeping things as normal as possible, making allowances for changes and closures made due to COVID-19, commonly known as the coronavirus, closures. “I want to assure everyone that the council and town staff are conducting business as normal as possible. I have been communicating or meeting regularly with council members, town staff, state and county officials and the seven other Carroll County mayors,” said Roop, on Wednesday night, April 1. “During these challenging times, as we deal with the impacts of COVID-19, the town will continue to provide essential services for our residents. During this period of social distancing, the town encourages using the telephone, email communication and use of the dropbox rather than the face to face interaction. The Town Hall will be closed to the public until further notice; anyone needing to meet with town staff will need to make an appointment.” Roop also informed those in the meeting that the playgrounds in town are closed, this includes the skate park, since they can’t sanitize the equipment on a constant and instantaneous basis nor can they ensure the proper physical distancing. Parks will remain open but those that attend are encouraged to practice proper hygiene and follow the six-foot physical distancing guidelines. Roop emphasized the concern the town has due to issues with the water and sewer systems from people flushing disinfectant wipes. “I’m sure most residents are using more disinfectant wipes during these challenging times, however, please do not flush these or any type of wipes down the toilet," said Roop. "This will only result in our sewer pumps becoming clogged and sewer backups, which could result in raw sewage backing up into your home. Please dispose of wipes with your weekly garbage.” While discussing water and sewer, Roop informed residents that there will be no water turned off for nonpayment or late fees, but that it is the responsibility of the residents to call the town office to make necessary arrangements if they are experiencing financial hardship and are unable to pay their water and sewer bill. The mayor and town council members encourage those that can pay their bill on time to do so. Roop and Councilman Ed Smith also ensured members of the community to be aware of scams going on, especially with checks coming from the federal government. “Do not give out any social security numbers to anybody, anytime and make a phone call to someone that you trust, law enforcement, whoever, State’s Attorney’s office if you have what you think is a scam," said Roop. "There’s a lot of people that, unfortunately are taking advantage of people in these type of situations. “They’ve already had a case where people were calling up and asking for social security numbers to make direct deposits into people’s accounts. Rest assured that will never happen, under no circumstance will anybody from the from the federal government, the state government, the IRS or any banking situation call you to ask you for any information over the phone — bank account numbers, social security numbers or anything to get that money in faster. It will not happen. Any phone calls that come in like that should be immediately reported to local law enforcement and should be ignored, ignored, ignored.” The repeated overall consensus throughout the meeting from Roop and the council members, were to follow the guidelines in place at this time with staying at home if you can, social distancing, maintaining a six-foot distance and clean. Next month, Roop announced that their Memorial Day service will be held on May 17, a week before their normal day to hold it. The service, like the council meetings, might also be held online.

Catonsville family makes, distributes 3D-printed face masks amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Marielle Canter played defense and was selected as the unsung hero when she was a senior on the 1996 Catonsville High field hockey team. Ten years after graduating in 1997, she married Ethan Weikel. Less than a month ago, the Catonsville residents, both 41, teamed up to become co-unsung heroes during the coronavirus pandemic. They have been making 3D-printed face masks and distributing them to local health care workers and community members in need. “We developed a design modified from another one we found from another 3D printer and kind of started going from there,” said Weikel, who grew up in southwestern Virginia. “We put our modified design online and that is available for anybody to download for free, and 4,000 people have downloaded that, so we are hoping that this same thing is happening all over the country and the world with 3D printers.” Putting together the masks has even become a family affair, as daughters Allana, 11, and Carolina, 9, and son Liam, 5, have helped with the construction. “It is somewhat labor intensive and all of our kids have been helping us putting together the masks,” Marielle Weikel said. “We have been using shoestrings for the tie. They seem to work really well to help tie them tightly, and so the kids have been putting those on.” Instructions are available so people know how to clean them and replace the filters. Three neighbors in the community are also printing the masks. “We’ve made close to 150 that were actually distributed so far,” Marielle said, noting the response has been overwhelming. “People are just so grateful. I think some folks on the front line just are really struggling,” she said. "It’s a stressful and scary time, first of all to know that people in the community care about them and want to do something to help them, but also for some folks this is really a solution for people who can’t get the regular N95s [masks] that are in short supply now.” The Weikels donated face masks to Saint Martin’s Little Sisters of the Poor on Maiden Choice Lane and to the Glynn Taff Assisted Living and Ridgeway Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center on Edmondson Avenue, and the latter responded with this Facebook post: “On behalf of the resident’s and staff of Glynn Taff Assisted Living and Ridgeway Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, we are so grateful for your ingenuity, fierce support, focus and generosity, to provide protection for those who care for our residents, in the midst of this pandemic and the scarcity of PPE supplies for caregivers on the frontlines. Your work and commitment mean more than you know for more than you know. On behalf of my family who has operated these facilities for more than 50 years, thank you. Marielle Canter Weikel and team!” Catonsville resident Susan Murrow, whose brother works at the facility, met the Weikels at church and was compelled to spread the word. “It would be really helpful for people to know that there is this kind of resource, especially with people scrambling to get masks,” Murrow said. “You go to Home Depot, there aren’t any; you go to Lowe’s, there aren’t any, and you go to hardware stores, there aren’t any.” Marielle and Ethan solved that problem. “I’m an environmental scientist, so this isn’t as much in my direct field of expertise, but I work for a nonprofit doing environmental conservation, so I kind of have the community-minded orientation,” Marielle Weikel said. “Ethan is both an engineer and a scientist.” The 3D printed masks are reusable and can be disinfected, and the filter material is replaceable. Ethan is determined to continue providing for the needy. “We know for the health care professional, and for others like that, the cloth masks and other do-it-yourself-type masks don’t really cut it. They need something with a higher level of protection and that what’s we are aiming for,” he said. “I’ve always been passionate about serving the public. I’m a federal employee, and there are things like serving the public that is just ingrained to me.” The masks are not Weikel’s first 3D print design. “I did other 3D print designs that are fairly complicated, including building a 3D printer from a 3D printer,” he said. Murrow, who reached out to the Weikels to help out at Glynn Taff, has seen firsthand the fruits of the local family’s efforts. “Resources are huge, especially during this time,” Murrow said. “It’s a really good feel-good story, which everybody needs right now.” To download the 3D-printed face mask instructions online, go to pinshape.com/items/60983-3d-printed-adult-face-mask-respirator.

As coronavirus spreads, Maryland officials begin turning Baltimore Convention Center into makeshift hospital
.W
Flanked by Humvees and doctors, state officials and the Maryland National Guard unveiled more details Tuesday about their plans to build a makeshift field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young toured the 1-million-square-foot facility to inspect the plans as officials rush to add 6,000 more beds statewide ahead of an anticipated surge of patients suffering from the coronavirus pandemic. “Look at New York. Look at Italy. Look at Washington State and California," Hogan, a Republican, said. “We don’t want to be like that. ... But we’re not that far behind some of those places. We just had our fourth death today. This is a serious thing." Maryland now has about 350 confirmed cases of the rapidly spreading virus, and health experts believe there are far more people infected. The federal government has pledged to deliver 250 beds for the downtown Baltimore facility, which will be jointly run by the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Hospital with help from medics from the National Guard. Hogan said the field hospital could be expanded to hold as many as 750 patients as the virus spreads. About 100,000-square-feet of the convention center would be used for the hospital. That could be expanded to 300,000 square feet, officials said. “There are places around the country where they’re looking at tents for field hospitals,” the governor said. “This is certainly a much better scenario.” Young said he was calling on the federal government to provide more help to cities. “We’re all in this together,” the mayor said. “I think we need to call on the president to bail out cities. It’s going to be a financial disaster for all of us.” In stepped-up efforts to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, Hogan announced Monday the state was ordering all nonessential companies to close while dedicating millions of dollars to help save small businesses. Reporters asked Hogan Tuesday about statements coming from President Donald Trump suggesting businesses could reopen after 15 days. “The mixed messaging makes it more difficult,” said Hogan, who is chairman of the National Governors Association. “We’re making decisions and taking steps that are very difficult. We’re asking incredible things of businesses to close.” When Trump sends a different message to the public about the seriousness of the disease, “that makes our jobs much harder,” Hogan said. The city-owned Hilton Hotel adjacent to the convention center, also will be used as part of the field hospital. The state already has freed up 900 more beds at hospitals statewide that are immediately available. Another 1,400 beds should be ready by early April. The state also is reopening the closed Laurel Regional Hospital, which would be able to accommodate 135 patients. Hogan said he was urging the federal government to deliver the beds for the field hospital at the convention center as quickly as possible. “I want to see a truck rolling in here from FEMA. That’s what I’m waiting on,” Hogan told workers assembled there Tuesday. “I obviously want to see it done yesterday. I know you’re working as fast as you can. It is going to save lives.” Maryland’s congressional delegation joined in the governor’s call Tuesday, writing a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency regional director MaryAnn Tierney. U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and the state’s eight congressmen urged “immediate” approval of 300 beds and more than 1,000 ventilators for use at the Baltimore Convention Center. “Maryland is actively planning, preparing and operating off of several models led by Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Maryland. These models project a significant surge in infections in the state over the next few months, even after taking several actions and interventions to combat the spread of COVID-19,” the lawmakers wrote. “While Maryland is quickly moving to stand up additional sites in existing facilities, hospitals and clinics, the gap in available beds will still exist and requires immediate federal assistance.”

General Assembly 2020: Session ends under a cloud of coronavirus uncertainty | COMMENTARY
.W
State lawmakers returned to Annapolis last January facing a serious challenge: With untested leadership, could they face off against a popular governor and approve sweeping, yet costly, education reforms along with the tax revenue to finance them? In just 71 days, nearly three weeks less than they would normally have had, they accomplished that mission, while also keeping the Preakness in Baltimore (assuming there’s a race to be run this year) and mandating background screening for private purchases of rifles and shotguns. On the same day that Maryland recorded its first coronavirus death Wednesday, the Maryland General Assembly wrapped up its 2020 legislative session — a solemn mid-term dismissal, rather than the customary sine die celebration. Legislators exited Annapolis with much achieved, much left undone, but above all, having been upstaged. They departed under a cloud of uncertainty as the health, welfare and economy of Maryland continues down an unknown and potentially perilous road. Still, the passage of the Kirwan Commission findings, the so-called Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, will surely prove the most consequential of the legislature’s actions, given its likely lasting impact on public education, to teacher training, compensation and retention, to preparing the next generation for the 21st century jobs market and, most especially, the hope this brings to Baltimore. Whatever medicine a city beset with violent crime might need, a prescription that does not include higher-performing schools was doomed to failure. We would urge Gov. Larry Hogan to consider this when it comes time to decide whether to veto the bill or not. The governor would be well-served to take a similar approach to public education and a potential second renaissance of Baltimore as he has to the public health threat we now face; when it comes to coronavirus, he’s been a nonpartisan, pragmatic leader.  As for the tax package that accompanies the educations legislation, providing adequate Kirwan funding through 2026, most measures are sensible, such as the higher tobacco tax. At least one, the first-in-the-nation tax on digital ads, is not (full disclosure: The Sun sells online advertisements). Realistically, such a veto might prove an empty gesture anyway. The General Assembly’s new leaders, Adrienne A. Jones of Baltimore County and Bill Ferguson of Baltimore, proved themselves as adept at managing their majorities as their longtime predecessors, the late Mike Busch in the House and Thomas V. Mike Miller who stepped down from his post in the midst of his cancer battle and related health concerns. In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, they not only condensed the calendar, they gave themselves an out — the expectation of a special session in May, timed not only to revisit the budget given the likelihood of diminishing tax revenue but to potentially override gubernatorial vetoes. Aside from the Kirwan legislation, there is at least one other high-profile target, arguably Speaker Jones’s most impressive personal accomplishment to date: the $580 million settlement of the HBCU lawsuit; Governor Hogan has said he is only willing to spend $200 million to address longtime inequities in funding historic black colleges and universities. The session will likely also be remembered for its breakneck pace at the end and the deliberate distancing of spectators and lobbyists alike, a move justified by medical necessity perhaps, but not always a good look for a legislative body where democracy is meant to be practiced with a small "d" and not just the large one. There’s a reason why lawmaking is often compared to sausage making: It’s not always pretty to witness the grinder in action. But it’s especially unattractive when it’s hardly seen at all, when public participation is diminished, testimony is limited, timetables are accelerated to ludicrous speeds. In the process, some good proposals got a short shrift from climate change to medical malpractice reform. And others that deserved close scrutiny, such as a fundamental change in the legislature’s budget authority, were approved without adequate public debate. Grading a General Assembly sessions is a fraught endeavor in the best of times given how even the most favorable actions often are tempered and the worst so easily revisited at a later date, but this year’s cries out for an "I" — Incomplete. While Kirwan’s passage offers hope, there are too many pitfalls ahead to see the work as done. As the doctors say, we now enter a time of home-bound watchful waiting: COVID-19 has made certain there is more work to be done in the weeks ahead. The Baltimore Sun editorial board — made up of Opinion Editor Tricia Bishop, Deputy Editor Andrea K. McDaniels and writer Peter Jensen — offers opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers. It is separate from the newsroom.

White Tiger Distillery making hand sanitizer to supply APG amid surging demand due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
Staff at the White Tiger Distillery in Forest Hill never planned to trade spirits for sanitizer. They anticipated the demand for it even less. Now, they are selling the antiseptic to Aberdeen Proving Ground along with businesses and people from Baltimore to Cecil counties, keeping the distillery open almost every day to meet demand. The distillery, which normally makes whiskies and other spirits, turned to making hand sanitizer as a way to weather the economic storm caused by the new coronavirus’ spread through the state. The virus cut into its business significantly, so when somebody suggested making hand sanitizer, staff thought to give it a try. The process of getting the first batch to production began on March 24. But they did not know how far it would take them. Matthew Shea, who does a little bit of everything around the distillery, said they originally planned for a short run of the hand sanitizer for staff, some local agencies and sale. Then the word got out and orders began pouring in. "The plan was to use a little bit of the alcohol we had on site, do a little bit for the team … do a little bit for sales and be done with it,” Shea said. "Never did we expect this to become this much of an operation ... This hand sanitizer thing just kind of exploded.” The distillery has delivered an order to Patient First in Aberdeen, and the Bel Air Police Department received a donation of the sprayable sanitizer as thanks from the distillery, along with other first response and law enforcement agencies. But the distillery has garnered attention from more than state and local institutions. Most recently, Aberdeen Proving Ground became interested in the sanitizer. Some workers at APG had bought it for themselves, and word spread to the base, Shea said. Four agencies at APG have placed orders for over 100 gallons each, Chief Operating Officer Mike Pyon said, and he is in talks with other federal and municipal agencies like the Department of Defense and the Baltimore Police Department, which wants 3,000 gallons of the sanitizer for its officers. The U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center — one of many tenants at APG — confirmed it had bought from White Tiger and is scheduled to receive more than 180 gallons of sanitizer. Orders came so fast that the distillery blew through its supply of 2-ounce bottles of the santizer in a couple weeks. The distillery is also limited by the supplies it can get, which are in high demand around the country, Shea said. To get what they need to continue production, the distillers have had to reach as far afield as Kansas and Missouri to get alcohol to make into sanitizer, Shea said. The distillers also had to switch up its 2-ounce bottles from a plastic spray top to a glass bottle, as they were having trouble getting the plastic ones from the distributor, Pyon said. “We are a little at the mercy of the postal service” and other delivery agencies, Shea said. And even before the product is made, more orders come in, Pyon said. The distillery is expecting a shipment of supplies Friday to make 5,000 gallons of the sanitizer, but almost all of that expected production is already reserved. “These people are calling and pre-ordering ... and we have not even started making it," Pyon said. “[Companies] are paying up front. That is how desperate they are.” Selling to APG is meaningful to the distillers, several of whom are veterans, including Shea. Giving back to the military and public safety institutions is their way of saying thanks as well as giving them an avenue to help defend against an unseen enemy. "Now, in a roundabout way, we have rejoined the fight to help defend the nation again,” Shea said. "It gives us a sense of duty, almost like we had when we were back in the military.” The distillery is going to sell jugs of its sanitizer to the public for $55 a gallon by April 20, according to a post on its Facebook page. Interested people can place orders online and pick them up in the distillery, which is only letting one customer in at a time, Shea said. White Tiger is also selling in bulk to local businesses like grocery stores, lawn care companies and others — some of whom are retailing the sanitizer to generate foot traffic to their own stores, Shea said. That is by design, he said, because the distillery wants to help spur interest in as many local businesses as it can by supplying them with a hot commodity. The business, Pyon said, is looking to stabilize its profits by selling to companies and consumers at fair rates before getting back into donations. He wants to keep providing aid to the community — one of the driving forces behind manufacturing the sanitizer in the first place — while also keeping the business afloat. "Now that the word is really getting out, now these big companies are coming to us,” he said. “Eventually we are going to have to circle back around and go back into the humanitarian phase … as we can start taking a certain percentage and start donating again.” White Tiger’s efforts have been publicly praised by the Maryland Department of Commerce, which lists the business as one of several that have stepped up to help flatten the curve. The distillery has had to dip into its alcohol reserves to make sanitizer, Shea said, turning carefully distilled spirits into common disinfectant — a painful process for those who see the amount of work that goes into each barrel. But it cannot be avoided in these times. “It hurts a little bit that you have to take something that was distilled and aging,” Shea said, “but it is a higher calling right now.”

Lacrosse coaches raise money to support hospital personnel battling coronavirus: ‘Every little bit helps’
.W
The final plan came from Navy men’s lacrosse coach Joe Amplo, but not the original idea. During a FaceTime call Saturday, Amplo’s twin brother, Kris, thanked his older brother’s wife, Jennifer, for making a donation to his GoFundMe page. Mystified, Joe Amplo asked for more information from Kris, who began to provide details of his efforts to partner with restaurants to feed doctors, nurses and other personnel working at hospitals in New York to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The concept stuck with the elder Amplo until the next day, when he asked his colleagues on the coaching staff of the U.S. men’s national lacrosse team to band together to do something similar. Head coach John Danowski, who helms Duke, and assistants coaches Seth Tierney (Hofstra) and Charley Toomey (Loyola Maryland) readily agreed and launched their own GoFundMe page to provide meals for hospital employees. “I got to thinking, ‘How can I or we leverage our networks if we got together with the USA coaches?’ That, to me, was the easiest way to reach the most people,” Amplo said Thursday. “We want to try to help as many people as we can. The restaurants are struggling, and gosh, the frontline workers are in it. Every little bit helps.” Amplo and Toomey, who both live in Severna Park, have partnered with Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis. Danowski is working with the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and Tierney has connected with Northwell Health on Long Island, New York. Danowski and Tierney plan to work with local restaurants to provide meals. Amplo and Tierney are looking into a few options, including re-stocking a mini-mart and making 300 to 500 Easter baskets for the employees to give to their families. “I think we all just feel somewhat helpless sitting at home and not being able to do anything,” Danowski said. “So this is a small piece of helping, and certainly we’re glad to do it.” The crisis facing hospital personnel is frightening, according to the coaches. Employees have worked double and triple shifts while facing the very real prospect that they could contract COVID-19. Hospitals have recalled recently retired workers to fortify an already exhausted workforce. Personnel who have shopped at grocery stores in their hospital gear have been treated like pariahs. “It’s been sad,” Toomey said. “People are nervous, and so we want to kind of keep them in a comfort zone and give them the ability to pick something up and go home and feed their families. … We’re just trying to fill the void that the hospital has at any given time.” Tierney called the stories he has heard “awful.” “They need to be thanked,” he said. “They need to know that people are thinking about them. When you watch the news and you hear about these projections that could possibly take place and these people are putting their families on hold to save someone else from another family, they need to be recognized.” Jan Wood, president of the Anne Arundel Medical Center Foundation and chief development officer for the center, said the crisis has been taxing on hospital personnel. “This is hard work,” she said. “They are day in and day out putting their own lives into the middle of an epidemic and doing so willingly and with a passion and compassion for the patients and families that they’re caring for. But it’s hard. They’re tired as I think many people in the midst of this are.” Since the page went live Tuesday, the coaches have raised $7,426 towards their $10,000 goal as of Thursday afternoon. The swift response has been a glimmer of hope in an otherwise depressing period of time. “I think in the lacrosse world, all I’ve seen in the lacrosse news lately is disappointment and frustration over seasons ending and all this going back and forth over the eligibility,” Amplo said. “If you looked at this two-and-a-half weeks ago on the front end of those decisions, I know I was one of those people that was saying, ‘Gosh, I can’t believe this is happening, that we’re ending the season.’ But looking back now, I think most of us would say, ‘I can’t believe I didn’t do something sooner.’ We’re talking about a quarter of a million people passing away. So I would hope that lacrosse people are asking, ‘How can we help? How can we go into action whatever way we can that can maybe fill our competitive juices a little bit?’ So it’s not surprising. I just think it’s timely.” Tierney said he has been especially heartened knowing that donors might have other pressing concerns. “We’re in a tough financial time as well,” he said. “People have to take care of their inner circle before they can help out some other people. But I know there’s so much generosity out there.” Amplo quipped that Danowski’s status in the lacrosse world has driven much of the fundraising. “I think I have 400 followers on Twitter. So I’m not really reaching out to that many people,” he deadpanned. “But Coach Danowski, he’s got that little blue thing next to his name, and his tweets get a lot of likes and retweets.” Wood, the Anne Arundel Medical Center’s foundation president, said the employees are grateful for the coaches’ generosity. “I think that’s one of the things that makes Anne Arundel Medical Center very special,” she said. “It is very much a state-of-the-art, high-performing regional health center, but with a community hospital culture, and that permeates through everything that we do. Our staff lives in the community and is working very hard. To see that their community supports them and is doing this for them and is giving back so that they can do the work they need to do really spurs them forward, creates a lot of positive energy, and allows them to hunker down and re-double their efforts. This is not going to end anytime in the near future, and they know that they’ve got a long road ahead of them. But to know that their community supports them in this way has really helped energize them to move forward.” All four coaches said they are willing to consider using any money exceeding the initial $10,000 objective towards another effort or going in a different direction with an eye on helping those affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The top priority is to remain open minded about how they can pitch in during a time of uncertainty. “We don’t know how long this virus is going to last and how long people are going to be out there,” Toomey said. “But we have to — in our own way — support these first responders and help them in any way that we can, and this is a way to get the community around them.”

Carroll County declares state of emergency due to coronavirus: 'We’re not going to stop it at this point’ 
.W
Carroll County is in a state of emergency, the Board of County Commissioners president declared Friday morning at a meeting of more than 100 people from across the county who will be on the front lines fighting the coronavirus. The county’s first case of the coronavirus, or the COVID-19 disease it causes, was announced Friday afternoon. Chris Winebrenner, communications manager for Carroll County, said in a phone interview at about 1:45 p.m. Friday that one case has been confirmed. Winebrenner said further details will be provided during a 3 p.m. news conference at the county office building, which can be viewed on Facebook. The morning meeting was held before this became public knowledge. At the meeting, county Health Officer Ed Singer said the county has moved past the containment stage and is focused on mitigation. “We’re not going to stop it at this point. There’s no way that it’s going to be contained within the United States,” Singer said. The five commissioners met Thursday afternoon to declare the state of emergency starting Friday, according to Commissioner Stephen Wantz, which allows the president of the board to streamline decision making without having to convene the entire board. Singer and Dr. Henry Taylor, deputy health officer, said the steps being taken by the state and local governments now may seem extreme and disruptive to daily life, but action is being taken so the health care system is not overwhelmed with patients. “We’re going to try to take that peak of the curve and spread things out so that we don’t have everybody sick at the same time,” Singer said. “A pandemic means that the containment phase will no longer work,” Taylor said. Taylor recommended keeping a distance of 6 feet between people and noted the disease is not airborne, but spreads through droplets. It is important for surfaces to be cleaned frequently and people to cover their coughs and sneezes, he said. People should wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, which is more effective than using hand sanitizer, Taylor said, because of the abrasion that occurs when rubbing hands together. If soap and water is not available, Taylor advises using sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. A Westminster police officer asked if certain cleaning products are better than others. Singer said products with chlorine are most effective, but others should work as well. He recommended people read packaging to check how long a product should remain on a surface before it is wiped away, for maximum effectiveness. The median age of a person with COVID-19 is 47, and the most vulnerable group is people over 60, Taylor said, citing the New England Journal of Medicine. More men than women have been infected, and few are children, which Taylor said is fortunate since most viruses affect the very young and very old people typically. Thirty-two pregnant women across the globe who tested positive for the disease have been intensively studied and their fetuses do not appear to be affected, according to Taylor. Pregnant women do not seem to be at a higher risk, he said. Maggie Kunz, health planner and public information officer for the county health department, said there is less of a worry that young people will get sick and more of a concern that they will spread the virus to vulnerable populations. While new information is still being gathered on an hourly basis, Taylor said so far it appears that the mortality rate stands at 3%. “Most illnesses are mild with good recovery,” Taylor said. People who think they should be tested for COVID-19 should first be screened by telephone, according to Taylor. Depending on the person’s answers to the questions, it may be recommended that they have a specimen collected to be tested, he said. Fever, cough and travel are some of the factors screeners are looking for, Taylor said. The Carroll County COVID-19 hotline can be reached at 410-876-4848 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, but those calling outside of those hours can leave a message or call the Maryland 211 line. Representatives from Carroll Hospital said they are ready to take patients. Colleen Hordesky, director of infection, prevention and control, said the hospital’s contract for testing is through LabCorp. Specimens have to be sent to New York, she said, and it takes four or five days to get a result. Lisa Rock, the hospital’s liaison for incident command, said they are getting questions from physicians outside of LifeBridge Health or Carroll Health Group, and they should be contacting the health department for guidance. As of Friday afternoon, the coronavirus had resulted in 33 deaths in the United States out of more than 1,200 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic Wednesday. Five more people have tested positive for the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 17, a spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan said Friday. Singer did not directly answer whether people had been tested for COVID-19 in Carroll County. “Globally, I think that probably that we’ve had people that have been tested in every jurisdiction probably at this point.” Singer said. “We’re not sharing those local numbers, at the direction of the Department of Health, as to specifically how many people have been tested in each jurisdiction.” Kunz said Thursday that commercial health laboratories such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics have begun offering testing, though it was not clear how many people have been tested. While Hogan on Thursday prohibited meetings of 250 people or more, Singer told the crowd at the Carroll County Public Safety Training Center that meetings of even the size of that meeting are a concern. “There’s a low risk that anybody here in this room or anywhere in Carroll County is going to contract the COVID-19 virus, but that’s going to change,” Singer said. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

Howard parks open but gates closed to vehicles in an attempt to control crowds during coronavirus pandemic
.W
While Howard County parks remain open amid the new coronavirus pandemic, the gates at all parks have been closed as of Wednesday so people cannot access the parks by vehicle in an effort to control crowds, the Department of Recreation and Parks announced. Residents are still able to enter parks via access walking paths. Rec and parks announced last week that all facilities — including the department’s headquarters, its three community centers, the Robinson Nature Center, the Meadowbrook Athletic Complex, the Kiwanis-Wallas Hall, and Belmont Manor and Historic Park — will be closed through March 29. All large events, gatherings, pavilion rentals and weddings, as well as programs that include 50 or more people, are canceled through May 11. The department stressed Wednesday that while the parks can still be accessed by foot, restrooms within all of the parks are closed and park patrons are urged to stay off playgrounds as the cleanliness of the equipment cannot be guaranteed. While schools have been closed due to coronavirus concerns, the Department of Recreation and Parks tweeted that staff has been monitoring parks this week and have observed that federal, state and local social distancing practices are not being followed. The department tweeted that at one point staff members observed more than 250 people on and around a playground and approximately 50 people on a basketball court. The department also said at one point the parking area at Centennial Park South was nearly full. As of Wednesday, there have been at least 85 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Maryland, according to state officials, with eight of those in Howard County.

Leaders in Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, work to get in sync on coronavirus response
.W
Not long after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a stay-at-home order for state residents, his counterparts in Virginia and Washington, D.C., followed suit with similar orders. While the timing of the orders Monday wasn’t planned, the leaders of the three jurisdictions have been in regular contact, discussing the best steps to slow the spread of the coronavirus that has sickened more than 181,000 Americans. Hogan, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser talk every several days, and their top aides are in touch on a near-daily basis. “It was important to the three of them that they be unified in this,” said Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan. The jurisdictions are markedly different in size, geography and demographics, and the leaders have different political goals — Hogan is a Republican, while Bowser and Northam are Democrats. But they share the Washington metro region, with its 6.2 million residents and hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Hogan’s order came first, in a 10:45 a.m. news conference in Annapolis. He then placed a call to Northam and Bowser at 1 p.m. to discuss the action he took in Maryland. John Falcicchio, Bowser’s chief of staff, said that call led his team to “put the finishing touches on everything” related to the district’s order, which was issued later Monday afternoon. “We had been talking about it before,” Falcicchio said. The orders — including Northam’s order in Virginia, issued at 2 p.m. — are similar. Residents are asked to stay at home, though people are allowed to go to work at essential jobs, to get food or supplies, to seek medical care and to get exercise. Violations of the orders in all three jurisdictions are punishable by jail time and fines. Maryland’s order is open-ended, while Virginia’s order runs through June 10 and the district’s order is in effect through April 24. The goal, all three leaders said, is to keep people home to stop the spread of COVID-19 disease. Northam’s office did not respond to requests for comment. But when he announced his order, he said: “It is clear more people need to hear this basic message: Stay home." Having nearly uniform rules across the Washington metropolitan region helps because residents and workers “cross those invisible borders all the time,” Falcicchio said. Said Ricci: “It’s easier to walk people through this if you have unity." While Hogan has discouraged Marylanders from taking out-of-state trips, that advice doesn’t apply to state residents who work across state lines in the district or Virginia — including people who work for the federal government or federal contractors. Keeping the federal workforce healthy is a priority for the region’s leaders. About one-fifth of the federal workforce is in the region — a point that Hogan has made repeatedly in national TV and radio interviews. “He thought it was important to take united action to protect the region,” Ricci said.

Trial for alleged Advance Granite shooter postponed as coronavirus forces courts to restrict operations
.W
A Cecil County man charged with a 2017 workplace shooting in Edgewood that left three dead has had his trial postponed for the third time amid fears of the novel coronavirus’ spread in Maryland. And his is not the only one. A jury trial for Radee Labeeb Prince had been scheduled to start March 23 in Harford County Circuit Court. His trial, along with others across Maryland, have been delayed amid the presence of COVID-19 in Maryland, which prompted courts to temporarily restrict their operations and close to the public. Prince, 40, of Elkton, is charged in connection to an October 2017, mass-shooting at Advanced Granite Solutions — his former place of work — killing three and injuring two others. He then drove to Delaware and shot a sixth person who he used to work with at a used-car dealership. A Delaware jury found him guilty of attempted manslaughter and a number of attendant charges in 2018, and he was sentenced him 40 years in prison. He is charged with three counts of first-degree murder, two of attempted first-degree murder, using a gun in a violent crime and illegal possession of a regulated firearm in Maryland. Deputy district public defender John Janowich, who represents Prince, said he has never seen a court closure like this in his decades of practicing law. He said Prince’s trial will likely be scheduled for September or October as the situation permits. The range of dates to host the trial was decided over a conference call, Janowich said, as attorneys have been encouraged to work from home as much as possible. "Nobody wants to see this postponed again. We want to get it done,” he said. “It is circumstances beyond anyone’s control.” An administrative order issued Monday by Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals Mary Ellen Barbera placed courts on higher alert and limited them to emergency court actions. Monday’s order superseded another, issued Friday, that gave individual courts more latitude to decide what they would and would not do. “Further rapid escalation of the emergency requires more comprehensive measures to protect the health and safety of Maryland residents and Judiciary personnel,” Monday’s order states. According to the order, bail review hearings, applications for protective orders, domestic violence protective petitions and emergency court functions will still be allowed. The courthouses themselves, however, will be closed to the public and staffed only by “essential personnel,” according to the order. Essential personnel are determined by administrative judges, court administrators, clerks of court, administrative clerks and administrative heads, the order states. Janowich said Prince’s trial could last two to three weeks, and a larger-than-normal number of potential jurors could summoned for selection. Harford County Circuit Court announced it would postpone trials and abide by the court of appeals’ order, according to a release on Maryland courts’ website. It will remain closed to the public through at least April 3, according to the announcement. The court of appeals also suspended deadlines for court filings as they are closed. “Statutory and rules deadlines related to the adjudication of criminal and juvenile matters shall be suspended and shall be extended by the number of days that the courts are closed,” the order states. Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler said that deputies will be stationed in the courthouse for security and advised people to stay away from the building in accordance with the order. "We just got the notice today of what the courthouse shutdown is going to look like,” he said. “Just like any other time, if you entered inappropriately, at a wrong time or when it was closed, you would face criminal charges.” Administrative Judge for Harford County’s Circuit Court Angela M. Eaves said motions could still be filed with the court, and judges can rule on issues that do not require testimony or argument. Judges are standing by to rule on emergency motions, and the order gives judges from all circuits temporary authority to sit in any Maryland trial court. District court in the county follows much the same rules as circuit, allowing petitions for protection, bail review hearings, emergency petitions and certain preliminary hearings, the court announced Friday. It will also stay closed to the public through at least April 3. As of Tuesday, there are 57 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Maryland. As of Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported 4,226 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S,, and 75 deaths correlated to the infection, which has sickened over 180,000 and killed 7,300 across the globe.

Merritt: Combat the coronavirus crisis by finding one thing that makes you happy each day
.W
How can anything that looks so innocent — think a spherical nosegay of red and white blooms — be so deadly? The photos of the microscopic coronavirus, that are on TV every day are constant reminders of the devastation of the disease. Words, such as “sorrow” for so many who have died and their families; “fear” for more devastating deaths; “grateful” and “awe” for the medical staffs; and “concern” and “anxiety” for so many others, inadequately express the wave of emotions that hurl through us like a tsunami.  We feel for the small businesses, the unemployed, the elderly, the delivery people, the students, and families and friends — all of whom are forced to cope. At the same time, on a smaller scale, we are also personally trying to adjust to sheltering in-place. No more concerts or dinners out. No more grocery shopping as we once knew it. No more parties, theater, movies or even doctors’ visits. So, what do we do now? Tips abound on TV and smartphones with hundreds of Facebook posts and videos showing images of creative ways, such as virtual happy hours, that enable people to connect with friends and family. Did you see the video of the family celebrating their child’s birthday by driving down their street, tossing balloons to neighbors who had gathered (at a safe distance) to wish her a happy birthday? I love the film of the dad taking dance lessons from his little girl. He learned the routine, despite his burly frame and lack of delicate movements, creating a memory that will not be forgotten by his daughter. I see others who are volunteering, such as the Carroll County women who are making face masks. In addition, volunteers are helping to distribute food where needed and churches are doing their part. The Loaves and Fishes Soup Kitchen of the Westminster United Methodist Church — where Paul and I attend — is still providing nourishing food, via bagged lunches to those in need. We’re also making sure the older members are being phoned regularly to ensure their well-being and to combat isolation.  In addition, some of the congregation is urged to contact fellow members to keep in touch. So far, the ways I’ve been coping are varied. With a constant diet of negative news — that must be reported — on TV and in the newspapers, I began limiting my TV watching to twice a day, morning and evening. I try hard not to tune in for more pandemic facts before I go to bed since anxiety isn’t conducive to sleep. I admit that a retired lifestyle is far different from the constant flurry of activities connected with careers and parenthood. Despite my social nature, I enjoy my home and staying in it hasn’t been too much of a sacrifice. As of this writing, after 23 days of inside activity, you could hardly say I’ve made a big sacrifice. (Maybe next month, I’ll be banging my head against the wall.) In that stable frame of mind, it’s been relatively easy to continue my routine. There’s always going to be meals to cook and a house to take care of. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t whistle while I work, but I do find a sense of calm and productivity when we’ve eaten a good meal and when all is clean. Paul and I have continued our daily walks which allow me to add more steps to my morning workouts, usually yielding at least 10,000 steps or more. That also makes me feel productive. I told our children, who have been checking in on us, that I try to find one small thing that makes me happy every day, though I’m in a far better place than those who are wondering where their next meal is coming from. A few weeks ago, with the inspiration of spring, I was reminded to spruce up the entrance to our home with a wreath of eggs and flowers — a welcome change for my front door that was left barren since the Christmas wreath was removed. I also brought the season into our foyer with annual Easter decorations —a vase of pussy willows from which were hung several years’ accumulation of plastic eggs and even two decoupaged eggs I made several years ago. A few stuffed bunnies given to me from our daughter during past Easters were cheerful reminders of our celebrations. That makes me happy every time I walk past. Though no one, except Paul and me, will see any of this, we’ll enjoy the promise of another season just the same. Since I’ve been limiting shopping trips, I wasn’t able to purchase Easter cards for my family, so I spent four days last week making them. It was fun choosing colors that I thought each might like and it brought my son and his wife, my daughter and her husband and our two grandsons closer to me in thought. That made me happy, too. Making phone calls to older friends and those who are isolated brings brightness to my day, as well.  This is a good time for me to think of  other ways I can, perhaps, make someone else’s day happy. More “happys” for me, and probably for many, are enjoying nature, such as the forsythia bush outside my window that suddenly sprouted golden blooms two weeks ago, brightening the grey winter landscape with the promise of spring. Prior to its blooming, I had cut a branch to bring inside and was happily surprised to be greeted by a few bright yellow flowers the next morning. Today, I’m watching over my plants that are shoving their way out of the earth toward the sun. I look forward to planting more flowers and, with that, another word comes to mind during this COVID-19 crisis — spring’s promise of hope.

Cowboy Eats food truck brings deliveries to Harford neighborhoods during coronavirus pandemic
.W
The coronavirus pandemic and the stay-at-home orders have led local businesses to tap their creativity and find new ways to serve customers. Local restaurants have adapted by offering carryout or delivery only. Randy Reinecke, owner of the Cowboy Eats food truck, came up with a way to continue to operate as food truck in these conditions. After discussing options with his team, he decided to use the power of social media and offer a slightly specialized service by taking his big yellow truck to neighborhoods and deliver orders directly to customers’ doorstep. "I get a point of contact in the neighborhood and that person helps get the orders, a $400 minimum for the neighborhood. They get them to me, [and] we will fill and deliver to the customer’s door fresh from a minute down the street,” Reinecke explained while standing at the back inside his yellow truck with his stations prepped and ready for the batch of orders on the line. “It’s going pretty well so far. I’m just glad we’re considered essential so we can keep doing this for people.” A longtime volunteer firefighter in Harford County, he knows about handling difficult situations. “With what I did in the fire department and really anybody that volunteers, it’s in you to do things that you can do to help anybody,” he said. Last Wednesday, Reinecke was parked in the Laurel Valley neighborhood in Abingdon. A few people stopped to take down the truck’s contact info as they safely walked by; others slowed down or even stopped to ask a quick question. Chris Forth was waiting a safe distance away to pick up his family’s order. “We have some previous experience with Cowboy Eats. We love the food so when we heard they were coming here, we were on board with it," Forth said. "I think it’s a great service for the community, too, particularly in the midst of this kind of craziness we’re dealing with right now.” Employee Jessie Knopp is usually the runner, gathering the orders and delivering them to the waiting customers “I feel like working on the neighborhoods I am able to help and give back to my community and I’m helping people in need,” Knopp said as she returned from one delivery and set off for the next. “This neighborhood today is number six. We have one tomorrow, [and] I’m hoping it will take off," Reinecke said. “I’m doing what I love to do. I can share it with people and hopefully help them in their time of need at the same time. I think it’s just the way I was brought up. It’s something that you do, to help others.” To bring Cowboy Eats to your neighborhood contact them at by phone 410-808-1599, on the web at cowboyeats1.com or find them on Facebook.

During the coronavirus pandemic, a little time outdoors can reduce stress for Howard County residents
.W
As our community practices social distancing, spending time outdoors offers numerous benefits for our physical and mental well-being. A recent study from the University of Maryland and Cornell University found that 10 minutes or more of time spent in nature can improve your mental health. An act as simple as walking around the neighborhood can provide exercise for our bodies and stress relief for our minds. The Middle Patuxent Environmental Area is a little-known local gem. According to the Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks website, the nature area of more than 1,000 acres is home to an abundance of wildlife, including 150 species of birds, more than 40 types of mammals and many amphibians, reptiles and fish. Over five miles of hiking trails are available to provide an escape into nature, including the Wildlife Loop Trail, the Southwind Trail and a smaller connector trail. Parking is available at 5795 Trotter Road. Learn more at middlepatuxent.org. Bird watching is another activity that is well-suited to these unusual times. Birds can be observed from indoors or outdoors, with a naked eye or with the help of binoculars. Indoor birding occurs through one or more windows of your home. Outdoor birding can happen from a porch or balcony, in your back yard or in a natural area such as the Middle Patuxent Environmental Area. The Howard County Bird Club offers many resources for bird watching in our area. The club is a chapter of the Maryland Ornithological Society, with a “mission is to promote the knowledge, development, protection and conservation of bird life and other naturally occurring species and their habitats.” The Howard County Bird Club’s website includes beautiful images of birds observed in our region, guides to birding in local natural areas and other information on how to start birding. The site’s address is howardbirds.website. A number of landscaping activities can be performed in March and April that will beautify your yard and help to clear your mind. According to the University of Maryland Extension Home and Garden Information Center, this is a good time to cut down perennials and ornamental grasses to within two inches of the ground. Other recommended activities include pruning roses, cutting back herbs and seeding your lawn. As the soil begins to dry out, trees and shrubs may be planted. Please keep in your thoughts and prayers the students, families and staff of River Hill High School. As you may know, in recent weeks two local students were killed in separate vehicle accidents. Senior Marc El-Sayed died in a car accident on Route 108. According to his obituary, Marc enjoyed traveling, volunteering and cooking. He was passionate about exploring other cultures and helping others, here and around the world. He planned to start college in the fall. Memorial donations may be made to the Yale Alumni Service Corps, which “promotes mutual cross-cultural awareness and sustainable development in under-served communities.” Contact Joao Aleixo at joao.aleixo@yale.edu. Ramsey Maghari was an 11th-grader who died as a result of injuries from a motorcycle accident. According to his obituary, Ramsey enjoyed exploring abandoned sites, taking photographs and riding bikes of all kinds — BMX bikes, dirt bikes and motorcycles. His goal was to become a motorcycle technician. Donations may be made in his honor to the Mike Rowe Works Foundation, which is dedicated to breaking educational stereotypes and helping students who wish to pursue trade careers. Donations can be made at mikeroweworks.org.

People need to stay healthy during the coronavirus outbreak. So don’t avoid the doctor, but take extra precautions | COMMENTARY
.W
My clinic patient asked me: Should primary care continue in a time like this? My reflexive answer was “yes,” and my reflective answer was “definitely.” I work as a primary care physician in a clinic that predominately receives patients who are on Medicaid. Our clinic is not associated with any hospital system. Most of our patients have chronic medical conditions. Many of my patients are unable to sustain economic fluctuations in their lives. These economic fluctuations become more evident when they are unable to receive healthcare. Despite the coronavirus outbreak, many patients still require primary care. As I am writing this article, the Maryland governor has taken appropriate public health measures to limit public gatherings. Anxiety among the public is high and some emergency rooms around the country are seeing a surge in patients. I have also observed a decrease in patients who need primary care in my clinic. Unfortunately, such a trend may lead to a rise in non-coronavirus related visits to emergency rooms. As part of the health care system, primary care keeps patients healthy so that they do not have to visit emergency rooms and hospitals. Primary care is the backbone of any health care system. However, unusual times call for different measures. Screening protocols and personal protective equipment need to be made available in clinics to protect medical professionals if a patient exhibits symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, as we practice social distancing, in-person visits are decreasing and many clinics are transitioning toward telemedicine. This includes virtual consults and talking to patients on the phone on how best to approach their care. These conversations with providers who have known their patients for many years are vital to help decrease the burden on emergency rooms and hospitals. As a primary care physician, I am approaching the coronavirus outbreak using four key questions to determine the right decision. Is my decision medically appropriate? Is my decision appropriate from a public health perspective? Does my decision prevent an economic burden on patients and emergency rooms? Is my decision morally defensible? In my view, the last question is perhaps the most important one. In Italy, many intensive care unit doctors had to decide who should be placed on a few ventilators when many patients needed the devices. No level of medical training can prepare a doctor for this, and yet the moral distress felt by such doctors is a burden they often carry alone. U.S. doctors already facing testing kit shortages may face ethical dilemmas when deciding on ventilator care. Should the life of a young individual be preferred over an older person who has pre-existing conditions? Should pregnant women be favored over patients who are not? Should COVID-19 patients get priority over patients who are equally sick but don’t have the virus? A natural response is: All lives are worth saving. Yes, absolutely. However, it still leaves doctors with tough choices to make. The decision on what ought to be done should be made using moral reasoning and not moral intuitions. Moral intuition means using your “gut feeling” to decide what is right. However, gut feelings may vary from person to person. The concept of moral “taste buds” explains why. We all have the same taste buds, but our degree of use, perception and emotional association with different tastes varies. Therefore, our likes and dislikes of foods vary. Similarly, two equally trained doctors may use moral principles at their disposal to varying degrees based on their experiences, beliefs and emotional associations with those moral principles. Arriving at the same decision should not be the criteria for the “right” decision. Instead, using a transparent and standardized process to arrive at a determination will ensure consistency in determining the “right” decision. Rather than potentially forcing medical professionals to make morally challenging decisions downstream in ICUs, hospital wards and emergency rooms, we need to share this moral responsibility upstream — by continuing to provide primary care and at a public level by socially distancing ourselves. Embracing this responsibility should be our collective honor and privilege. Dr. Ali Thaver (ali.thaver@jaimedical.com) is a primary care physician at Jai Medical Center in Baltimore.

TownMall of Westminster closed in reaction to coronavirus; tenants worry about uncertain future

TownMall of Westminster — subject to changes in ownership, the fading fortunes of retail and constant rumors over the past few years — is now subject to Gov. Larry Hogan’s COVID-19 mandate. The mall, like all others in Maryland, shuttered its doors at 5 p.m. March 19, and it is not clear when it might reopen — and how many tenants will reopen with it. “My biggest concern is, how many of these small businesses that are closing for this won’t be here to open up in a couple of weeks?” said Bryan Combs, owner of The Westminster Barbershop in the TownMall. “Any small business right now is kind of day-to-day, and when something like this happens it’s hard to say what will happen on the other end.” At a Thursday morning news conference, Hogan announced new efforts to help reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus and the illness it causes, known as COVID-19, including limiting gatherings to 10 people and ordering all enclosed shopping malls in the state to close at 5 p.m. As of Thursday afternoon, the coronavirus had resulted in 157 of deaths in the United States, including one in Maryland, out of about 11,274 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Dr. John Wah is a practicing physician as well as one of the owners of Battleground in the mall. He said that while Battleground is closed, he worries more about many of the other businesses housed in the mall. “I can image how disruptive this can be for people if this is their sole business. It’s definitely disruptive for us, but luckily for us, the three of us have other areas as to make money,” he said. “That’s not the case for a lot of people in the mall. They are not making an income and all their bills are continuing to collect.” Rather than a blanket closure of malls, Wah said he wished the government had considered allowing each business to create a sort of limited schedule for servicing clients. “In my office right now we are staggering patients so they are not waiting in the waiting room. They wait in their car and get called into the office solo,” he said. “I think a lot of other businesses could have done something like that.” That might have been in the cards without the governor’s order, according to Fred Meno, president and CEO of asset management and asset services for the Woodmont Company, which manages TownMall. “Often with malls, we follow the anchor tenants and adjust our hours in a situation like this according to their hours,” he said in a phone interview around 3:15 p.m. Thursday. “In this case we have the government authority mandating the closure of all retail and entertainment establishments and we will be closing at 5 p.m.” It may be there would have been no customers to patronize those anchor tenants even if the mall had been able to remain open with modified hours. “The mall is a ghost town. It’s been a ghost town since Monday,” Combs said. “The small businesses, which is mostly what the mall is comprised of these days, we understand it’s necessary. It’s important for the safety of everyone.” Wah also understands the necessity, but worries that it’s hard to know what actions are sufficient to mitigate spread of the disease, and what actions might be going too far and unnecessarily harming local businesses. “People need to at least understand they are not doing this for no reason, and if it is helpful, you’ll never know it,” he said, since success means little spread of COVID-19 cases and actions like closing malls could seem like an overreaction. Either way, a long-term closure could be devastating for some businesses, even if it stops the spread of the virus. “As we speak, Battleground is closed. It’s not making any revenue and our monthly expenses are the same. If they stick around with this, a good percentage of the businesses in the mall right now, they might not be there,” he said. “There have to be a lot of business in the mall right now just panicking.” According to Meno, Woodmont is not making any blanket decisions about lease payment or utility relief, it is something the company is willing to speak to tenants about in an effort to keep tenants in place. “I think it’s probably safe to say the local mom and pop type tenants are a little bit more hand-to-mouth than the larger national retailers,” he said. “We will address each individually as those requests are made, understanding each tenant has a different story and balance sheet.” In the meantime, businesses will do what they can. Combs has temporarily found other locations outside the mall to cut hair and is still taking appointments. He’ll try to make other arrangements should more establishments be ordered closed by the government. “I am open for business and appointments, it just may be outside under a tree, I don’t know,” he said. “Wherever we can do business, we will.” Battleground, meanwhile, may try to offer some from of online gaming tournament at some point, Wah said. Not as a money-maker, but as a way to bring the community together, without physically bringing them together. “That may just be goodwill for community so people have something to look forward to,” he said. “To get the community back up and running and get a little sunshine in this period.”

When will coronavirus be over?: 6 Baltimore artists reflect on what the pandemic took away
.W
Hiking familiar trails. Eating out at favorite restaurants. The simple act of working with other people. Camaraderie. These are some of the things that six people from Baltimore’s art and restaurant communities said they missed the most about life under quarantine. They likely seem familiar to many around the world as the COVID-19 pandemic takes more lives— by Tuesday afternoon over 300 in Maryland alone — with seemingly no end in sight. In times of duress, the hope that things can return back to normal keeps people going. With that in mind, here are some of the things for which these creative class members said they’re yearning, as well as the first activities they plan to do once the pandemic clears. Mark Clarke and Maya Camille, gallery and museum leaders Founder Mark Clarke and curator Maya Camille operated their conjoined institutions, The Gallery About Nothing and Mini Hip Hop Museum in the Jonestown neighborhood, for nearly a year before COVID-19 hit. But they haven’t held a grand opening celebration yet. “Hopefully, when they tell us we can go back outside, we can plan a really official, big old grand opening where everyone can come in, meet artists and buy art, and just have a really nice time,” Camille said. In the interim, the gallery and museum had to deal with the monetary issues that artists around the city face now that they’re confined to their houses. Besides their business and regular programming, including hip hop-themed game nights and painting classes, the pair said they miss some treasured rituals. One involves the gallery team going out to eat after the events they host Thursdays through Sundays. “We’re a family down there, so it’s really crazy to not have that kind of camaraderie in my life at all," Camille said. She added that she can’t wait to go hiking in places like Lake Roland in Towson without worry. Asked what he’ll do first when the pandemic clears, Clarke said, “I’ll probably just go eat somewhere," and “I want to hop right back into having an event.” Ashley Minner, artist and educator Despite the loss of some art-related gigs, Ashley Minner’s life remains largely stable. She spends considerable time working on her dissertation in American studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. “Other people definitely have it worse than I do,” she said. That doesn’t mean that COVID-19 hasn’t hit home. A class she teaches at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County had to move online. One of her students tested positive for the novel coronavirus. She’s scared for elder people in her life, who she feels don’t take the pandemic seriously enough. Still, her introverted nature eases the burden of sheltering in place a bit. The first things she plans to do when it’s allowed: “Probably going out to eat pho with my husband. Going to shop and not having to do so in fear." As a couple of trips she planned to take got cancelled, she said she looks forward to traveling again. Ashish Alfred, restaurateur and chef The namesake head of The Alfred Restaurant Group, which includes Duck Duck Goose in Fells Point and other properties in Bethesda, is clear in his recommendations for anybody concerned about their favorite restaurants. “If people feel badly for us or want to help us, the best thing they can do is follow the rules...we want and desperately need to get back to work, and the longer people keep acting like this is an extended spring break, the longer that’s going to take for us.” he said. Alfred has reason to be concerned. With the restaurant industry taking massive hits from forced closures, he’s had to defer payments on his car and insurance. He is also concerned for his group’s workers. “I’m am looking forward to, the most, putting paychecks in the hands of my people,” he said. “And that’s not a PR answer, that’s a real answer.” He added that he misses the “simple pleasures,” including getting a haircut, going to the gym and AA meetings. He also plans to hug his mother, who he said “falls into the category of people that’re most at risk for COVID," as soon as the pandemic passes. Shan Wallace, visual artist and educator Before the pandemic, Shan Wallace had just launched a major exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art, entitled “410,” highlighting her hometown. In the weeks since, she would have an opening reception and programming at the BMA’s Lexington Market outpost cancelled. Another show in North Carolina was rescheduled to next year. In spite of that, she directs much of her concern to the community depicted in her art. “Not only are people dying, but a lot of black people are dying,” she said. Wallace acknowledged that for her, personal and professional realms are not separate. She said she’s missing “being out in the streets for 12 hours a day, meeting strangers, meeting sitters [for my art] who essentially become family." When the pandemic clears, she plans to immerse herself in the social and artistic world. Joy Davis, gallery director The director and curator of the Waller Gallery in Old Goucher worked from home for enough of her career that being confined there wasn’t the biggest deal. But the cancelled exhibitions and trips were. Ironically, Davis said that she has more social time now. “If anything, it’s forcing me to talk to people that I kind of put off, because I [didn’t] have time,” she said. "I actually have time to socialize. That said, like other respondents, she said that she missed the social and community aspects of her work the most. She looks forward to doing that again and traveling again. “Being in the space and working with the artists is something I’m looking forward to professionally,” she said. “Personally, it is going on vacation, actually being able to leave the state...being able to move about and feel unrestrained.”

Larry Hogan slightly lifted restrictions on outdoor recreation. 7:26 p.m.: Citing the massive hit on Maryland’s economy from the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday vetoed several pieces of high-profile legislation that required additional spending ― including a sweeping overhaul of the state’s public schools and a funding increase to address inequities at historically black colleges and universities. 5:53 p.m.: The Alexander Brown Restaurant, located at 135 E.

Precautions to take How to prepare Aside from wiping down surfaces, washing hands with soap and refraining from touching your face, Marylanders should prepare to work from home and brace themselves for closures of schools, businesses, airports and governments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed their guidance on wearing cloth face coverings in public settings earlier this month, writing that those who are in situations “in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain” should wear cloth face coverings. U.S. health officials initially told citizens that masks do not provide benefits to average, healthy citizens. However, as officials balance saving surgical masks for medical personnel with the news the disease can spread from hosts who are asymptomatic, officials have updated their guidance to recommend people make cloth masks out of common household items. “The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators,” the CDC wrote. “Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.” Call before you go to get tested This will help medical professionals take steps to keep others from getting infected or exposed, the CDC website states. If you think you have the coronavirus, if possible, put on a face mask before coming into contact with other people or entering a facility and ask the health care provider to call the local or state health department.

Taking care of my sister’s children while she treats coronavirus patients | COMMENTARY
.W
The car was silent as I drove home with my niece and nephew in the back seat. Usually, when they come to my house, my niece is nonstop talk and my nephew, who is autistic, is repeating my son’s name over and over again. Signs of how excited they are, how much they love coming to spend time with us. This day there was nothing. They each just stared out the window. I asked my niece how she was. She just shrugged. I asked my nephew the same question. “Nothing,” was his reply. His way of saying that he just wanted to be left alone. Usually when they come to my house it is for the weekend, to give the sitter a break and let my sister, an intensive care nurse, catch up on much needed sleep. Sometimes, while on vacation from school, they come for several days. Always there is a known time when their mother will be picking them up or joining us for a few days before they head home. Not this day; it is the unknown that weighs so heavily. I had been gently prodding my sister as to when the children would come to us. She always reassured me it wasn’t time. She was still in her regular unit at the hospital and she was taking every precaution. She came home from work, stripped down, took a shower and made sure she was sanitized before hugging the kids. The sitter was still willing to come watch the kids, although each day there were more and more comments about not being able to continue to do so. The sitter, elderly but in good health, was in a high risk group. She, like all other workers, was doing a daily assessment between the need for a paycheck and the need to safeguard her health. This day when I called my sister, I knew immediately the time had come for me to have the talk with her. As she answered the phone, her hello felt strained. I knew she was holding back tears. “I didn’t sign up for this,” she told me. “I didn’t sign up to send my children away not knowing when I will be able to see them again.” She was being transferred to the COVID-19 ICU unit. She was being sent to the front lines. We talked about the logistics. When and how her daughter needed to get online for classes. What could be done for her son in terms of speech therapy and keeping him occupied. We discussed the importance of keeping their schedule, especially for her son who doesn’t always do well with change. We went over the medication schedule for her son, setting up online playdates for her daughter, the day-to-day routines we both knew so well. It was a way to put off, if even for just a few minutes, the truly difficult conversation. Then, talk of wills, guardianship papers, advance directives. She reminded me that, if things got bad at her hospital, I wouldn’t need to make any decisions. The doctors and nurses would make that call based on her condition and the conditions at the hospital. I reminded her that I had friends who would make masks. That I was trying to locate a 3-D printer to make face shields. I made her promise that if personal protective equipment started running low, she would contact me immediately so that I could use my resources to get them to her before the hospital ran out. We met at the usual halfway point between our homes. The children got in my car. She thanked me and commented on how lucky she was to have a place to send them where she knew they would be loved, they would be safe. I promised to video chat, send her daily updates. As I pulled out of the parking lot I looked back. She was hunched over the steering wheel, crying. All I could do was pray that this would not be the last time I saw her. Laura Morton (lgmattymd@hotmail.com) is an attorney and candidate for Judge of the Circuit Court for Carroll County.

In an era of coronavirus quarantine, Maryland nonprofit and other crisis hotlines face growing demand 
.W
Sue-Ann Siegel wasn’t used to working in the sunlight. She usually answered the phone from a dim corner office in the Maryland suburbs, illuminated by small desk lamps and a blinking dashboard that showed how many callers were left in the queue. It felt unnerving to work from home, she started to say, when the hotline rang. Siegel readied the tone she had perfected over five years of talking to strangers about their divorces and affairs, bankruptcies and unemployment, panic attacks and thoughts of suicide. “Hello,” she said, her voice soft like a late-night radio host’s. “Lifeline — how are you doing today?” The young man on the line sounded strained. He had just moved from New York to Maryland, he said. His girlfriend was developing flu-like symptoms, and they got into a big fight when he asked whether she might have the novel coronavirus spreading across the United States. He was also growing worried about his elderly parents — especially his father, whom he is close to. The man paused, then added: It felt like his anxiety was returning. “Mm,” Siegel said. “I hear that life is hurting you right now. . . . These are confusing, confusing times. For all of us.” Crisis center hotlines emerged in the United States in the 1960s, and for decades they have measured the pulse of the communities they serve. In the year after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, more than 80,000 people called the New York City Mental Health Association hotline. In the hours immediately after the 2016 presidential election, calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline nearly tripled. And during the 2018 hearings on the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the number of people who called the National Sexual Assault Hotline spiked by 201 percent. Now, amid a global pandemic that has brought regular life in parts of the United States to a halt, crisis hotlines face an unprecedented need, experts say. Government officials have imposed drastic social distancing measures to stem the spread of the virus, closing schools and churches and banning unnecessary travel. The disruption of in-person support systems has left crisis hotlines — and the people who run them — at the front lines of what doctors warn may be devastating psychological fallout from the coronavirus crisis. Since Maryland’s first reported cases of the virus three weeks ago, the nonprofit EveryMind, for which Siegel works, has seen a sharp uptick in people reaching out to its 24/7 mental health support hotline and online chat service. Rachel Larkin, who oversees the group’s crisis-prevention services, said that in the month of March, the hotline’s average wait time has gone from about 20 seconds to a minute, suggesting a growing need. Staff members like Siegel have had to double up on shifts, sometimes staying “online” for as long as eight hours at a time. Because of the number of people calling to talk about the pandemic, “virus” has been added as a category for employees to tag calls. At the Montgomery County Crisis Center, a government agency that also runs a 24/7 call center, lines have been so busy that manager Dorne Hill said she has had to pick up shifts herself. Last year, the center had 2,996 calls in the month of March; this year, the center logged 2,581 calls in just the first two weeks of the month. “What (people) are describing,” Hill said, “is a feeling of overwhelmed-ness.” For those with preexisting anxiety disorders, the virus — and the near-constant news cycle surrounding it — has become a potent trigger, sometimes causing debilitating spirals, doctors say. Orders to shutter museums and restaurants, close public schools, and ban gatherings can introduce another layer of distress. And with in-person therapy visits becoming increasingly unlikely under directives to stay home, a hotline may be the only place to which some people can turn. “No matter where you were functioning before, this is hard,” Larkin said. “And for the people struggling before, they’re really struggling now.” Siegel recounted the story of a caller who was devastated that her therapist had stopped hugging her or patting her on the back — often her only form of physical contact each week. “She lost her hug,” Siegel said. “Her once-a-week hug.” “There are so many other stories,” she added, shaking her head. “Things, problems I couldn’t even imagine.” There was the young man, a regular caller with paranoid schizophrenia, who started to spiral when he was asked to download the video conferencing app Zoom to talk to his therapist. He was convinced that government spies were planning to infiltrate his calls. There was the homemaker with severe depression who said that without museums or movie theaters, she had little to fill her day — and little distraction from her recurring thoughts of suicide. There was the man from a nursing home who said he was “losing hope” because his girlfriend could not visit him, and the middle-schooler who told Siegel they identified as gender ­non-binary and could fully feel like themself only at school — not at home. “Simple things,” Siegel said between calls one recent afternoon. “Simple, simple things, but for someone, they really matter.” EveryMind is recruiting volunteers to help staff its hotline and text services and has ordered eight more landline phones for employees to connect to their laptops, allowing them to take calls and file call reports from home. With the mass layoffs that have already begun in the retail, food and hospitality industries, the nonprofit is preparing for an even bigger surge in calls, Larkin said. “It’s not just the people losing their jobs, it’s their families, those around them. . . . There is going to be some sort of massive traumatic element to this,” she added. Siegel said that in recent weeks, she has gone back and forth on whether to “normalize” feelings of coronavirus-related anxiety by discussing her own experiences living and working in Montgomery County, a suburb of 1 million where 107 cases had been reported as of Tuesday afternoon. Call specialists are typically urged not to share details about their personal lives, and many, including Siegel, use an alias. “Do you say, ‘Oh, I’m anxious too’ or ‘We’re all anxious’? I think so, because that’s true,” she said. “These aren’t ordinary times for any of us.” One recent afternoon, Siegel settled into a chair in her home office for two back-to-back shifts spanning eight hours. With each stranger who called, she tried to persuade them to focus on the realm of things they had within their control. “Your dad,” she said to the young man who called feeling anxious about the virus, “you’re going to see him today? Good, that’s good.” When the phone clicked off, she swiveled her chair around and leaned back. There is a line she and her colleagues like to share, she said. “We say that we don’t save lives — that’s for first responders, cops, doctors. What we do is give folks another day.” ____ EveryMind hotline: 301-738-2255 Montgomery County Crisis Center hotline: 240-777-4000 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 800-273-8255 National Suicide Prevention chat service: suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat

With few athletes to advise, Maryland athletic trainers pitching in to help contain coronavirus
.W
Tim Happel has become accustomed to delivering disappointment. As the head athletic trainer at Howard Community College in Columbia, Happel has often had the unenviable assignment of informing an athlete that an injury has delayed or ended his or her season. Now in his other career as an athletic trainer at MedStar Sports Medicine, he has been tasked with calling people to let them know that they tested negative for the novel coronavirus. “Going back to what we normally do, a lot of times we have to give the bad news like ‘You can’t play today,’ or ‘You tore your ACL, and your season’s over.’ We do that more than what we like to do,” Happel, 35, said Thursday. “So to be on the other end of it and give some positive news all day long is really nice.” In the fight to contain COVID-19, it’s all hands on deck in the medical and healthcare professions, and that has included several athletic trainers, who have the time and desire to pitch in. “I like to do stuff, and I think most athletic trainers do,” said Michael Monahan, a 29-year-old athletic trainer at Urbana High School in Frederick County and Pivot Physical Therapy who has been checking the temperatures of truck drivers picking up shipments from the Pepsi warehouse in Columbia. “We’ve got a wide variety of skills that we’re capable of doing, and we like to utilize them. So sitting down and not doing anything when I can be out there working and I can be out there helping with the issue that is putting us out of work, it just seems logical that I would be working.” Added Kelley Crowe, a 31-year-old athletic trainer at Arundel High School who also works for MedStar: “I think everybody misses the normal routine. Just being able to be a part of this and be able to help is what is really important.” Happel, who grew up in Arbutus and graduated from Lansdowne High School and Towson University, and Crowe have assisted in field tents erected by MedStar outside area hospitals to facilitate the flow of potential patients by checking for referrals and other documentation. Since then, for the past four weeks, they have been driving to a call center in Elkridge to call those who have negative tests. “It’s definitely hard being away from the community you’ve been involved with at high school and being away with sports, but these are just such crazy times right now that being able to be at the forefront of this pandemic and help in any way that we can is meaningful,” Crowe said. “These are such different times, and with athletic trainers, we’re utility players. You can use us in many different environments.” Andrea Durham, a 30-year-old head athletic trainer at James Hubert Blake High School in Silver Spring and MedStar since 2018, has been working at a drive-thru site in Bethesda for the past month. She helps collect documentation and input orders into the computer system. “It’s been interesting because not a lot of other professions know what we do and what we can contribute,” she said. “We’re like, ‘We can do that, we can take vitals.’ That’s been pretty cool just showing them the different things we can do. So it’s nice to be used. It’s nice that we were able to get re-purposed.” Monahan, who grew up in Mt. Airy, could no longer work at the high school when all schools in the state were shuttered March 16. Two weeks later, he was furloughed March 30 and began emailing Christy Kingan, the director of sports medicine operations at Pivot, for job opportunities. On Monday, he began daily shifts at Pepsi, where he uses an infrared reader to check truck drivers’ temperatures. Drivers with readings between 99.5 and 100.4 degrees are given the option of another test or driving back to their homes, while drivers with temperatures exceeding 100.4 degrees are – within reason – sent home immediately. “I’m just happy that I am doing something,” he said. “I think most people would be in my shoes. If somebody is in need – whether that’s a warehouse worker or a high school athlete – I’m going to try to help them out. It’s just kind of what healthcare professionals try to do.” Breaking free of the usual confines associated with athletic trainers has been a priority for the Maryland Athlete Trainers Association (MATA). For the past five years, the organization has been working on avenues to expand access to athletic trainers. On March 18, state legislators voted to pass a bill that would permit athletic trainers to work in corporate or industrial settings to help employees. The proposal, which will become law Oct. 1, will match similar legislation in 20 other states, according to Ed Strapp, who chairs MATA’s government affairs committee and is a flight paramedic for the Maryland State Police. “They’re lifting, they’re pulling, they’re doing very athletic maneuvers in their day-to-day jobs,” he said of certain corporate and industrial employees. “Why shouldn’t they have access to athletic trainers to help them either recover from injury or prevent them from being injured?” Del. Karen Lewis Young, a Democrat representing Frederick County who led the effort to push the bill through the House of Delegates, said athletic trainers are an under-utilized group that can help expand their roles. “The term athletic trainer may be somewhat of a misnomer because they’re healthcare professionals who provide treatment and services under the direction or in collaboration with physicians, and it’s in accordance with their education, training, state statutes, and rules and regulations,” she said. “And think of some of the essential workers right now. They’re working in supermarkets, they’re loading groceries, they’re loading supplies and probably at a faster rate than ever and working longer hours. Wouldn’t it be so much more convenient to have additional access to prevent and treat potential injuries?” Strapp said athletic trainers are eager to break the conventional mold of their professions. “What we’re seeing is that people are recognizing athletic trainers as healthcare providers more than just standing on the sidelines and giving out water bottles and running onto the fields when somebody gets hurt,” he said. “… It has allowed people to see that athletic trainers really are a broad-based medical provider and that we have a lot of skills.” Happel, the Howard Community College athletic trainer, said he checked the athletic schedule on his cell phone Tuesday and noticed that he would have staffed a women’s lacrosse game at CCBC-Essex. But he said any sadness has been overwhelmed by being the bearer of good news. “I think there are opportunities to help out,” he said. “… It’s really nice to be a useful part of the system and really be helpful during such a time of need for so many people. We want to be an extra set of hands. To jump in and help in the fight, it’s nice to be a part of that.”

Baltimore’s homeless services director on leave during coronavirus outbreak; deputy no longer on the job
.W
The Baltimore mayor’s director of homeless services is on leave and the office’s deputy director no longer works for the city, actions advocates say are especially worrisome during the pandemic and the threat it brings to people who live in encampments and shelters. James Bentley, a spokesman for Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, said Jerrianne Anthony is on paid personal leave and John Turner is no longer a city employee. He did not provide a reason for either personnel action. Meanwhile, the office’s chief of staff has resigned, effective later this month. Anthony is the second top-ranking Young administration official who has been on leave during the pandemic. David McMillian, the director of the Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management, was on leave as the pandemic shut down the city. McMillian’s employment ended March 25, according to Bentley, who corrected information he provided earlier Tuesday about McMillian’s status. Officials declined to provide further information about his departure. Bentley said the mayor asked two top aides, Sheryl Goldstein and Tisha Edwards, to temporarily oversee homeless services. The city also is bringing in a consultant “to assess the office’s strengths and needs and manage the day-to-day operations,” he said. During a news conference Tuesday at City Hall, Goldstein said the consultant will make recommendations for organizational and staff changes. Neither she nor the mayor addressed a question about what led to the changes. Bentley said “continuity of operations to support and keep homeless individuals safe and healthy is Mayor Young’s critical priority at this time.” “We’re going to always take care of our homeless population, no matter what,” Young said Tuesday. Anthony was hired in August 2018 and is paid $130,000 a year. She helped roll out a plan to open new temporary shelters during the coronavirus outbreak so people experiencing homelessness had more space to spread out and lower the risk of contagion. Anthony also helped establish screening and testing protocols for people at shelters and arranged for hygiene items and water to be dropped off at encampments. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful. Turner was hired in April 2019 at an annual salary of $95,000, according to online records. It is not clear why his employment with the city ended. He also could not be reached for comment. The chief of staff, Hannah Roberts, has resigned from the office, according to an email obtained by The Baltimore Sun. Roberts, who earned about $80,000 annually, will remain in her position until late this month. She wrote that the administration asked that she stay on the job, but she decided otherwise after “careful consideration.” In her message to the Baltimore City Continuum of Care board that helps steer homeless services in the city, Roberts said she admired the “integrity and perseverance” Anthony brought to the job. “Jerrianne inherited a tremendously difficult charge, with the responsibility to rectify inadequate shelter conditions, identify permanent housing opportunities, and create a unified agenda for change for thousands of people in an environment where the needs far outpace the available resources,” Roberts wrote to the board. “I am depending on each of you to take up this charge and bring to fruition the goals and objectives outlined in the community’s Action Plan on Homelessness.” Winston Philip, chairman of the local Continuum of Care, called the situation “very complicated” in an email sent over the weekend to board members. “This is less than optimal anytime but, especially during this pandemic,” he wrote. “While lives are literally at stake, our community of people experiencing homelessness is always in double jeopardy.” Philip told The Sun on Monday that he did not have more information about Anthony and Turner’s employment, but said the board remains committed to fighting for the needs of people experiencing homelessness. “I cannot stress enough that our focus is on continuity of services for the extremely vulnerable population of our neighbors that are experiencing homelessness,” he said. Antonia K. Fasanelli, director of the Homeless Persons Representation Project, said the changes in the homeless services office’s leadership are “troubling at best.” The office, she said, “is responsible for the lives of some of the city’s most vulnerable citizens. We call on the agency daily, if not hourly. The agency needs strong, transparent leadership at this time and it’s not yet clear whether MOHS will have that or the ability to fulfill its mission going forward.” Baltimore Sun reporter Emily Opilo contributed to this article.

Roy Lester, former Maryland football coach and Montgomery County legend, dies of coronavirus complications
.W
Former Maryland football coach Roy Lester, a revered high school coach in Montgomery County, died Sunday in Rockville of complications caused by the coronavirus, his family said. He was 96. Born in Reedy, West Virginia on Oct. 3, 1923, he was the son of Elva Roy and his wife, Sybil. He was a graduate of Spencer High School and went to West Virginia and played football, basketball, baseball and ran track. In the middle of his college years, he was called to serve in the Navy at Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii. Mr. Lester spent three seasons at Maryland from 1969 to 1971, going 7-25 before being relieved of his duties. During his tenure, 13 of his recruits went on to play in the NFL, most notably Dallas Cowboys star defensive end Randy White. After graduating from West Virginia with a degree in political science, Mr. Lester briefly played for the Philadelphia Eagles’ farm team, the Patterson Panthers, in the American Football League. He began his coaching career in 1950 with a two-year stint at Walton High in West Virginia before moving to Allegany High in Cumberland. Before his time at Maryland, Mr. Lester made his mark coaching at Richard Montgomery, where he went 86-10-1 in 10 years with six undefeated seasons in the 1960s. It was there that he coached Baltimore Colts All-Pro linebacker Mike Curtis, who died April 20 at the age of 77. Mr. Lester was hired in 1968 to coach at Maryland, inheriting a program that won only two of 19 games over the previous two years. Mr. Lester guided the Terps to a 3-7 record in his first year and went 2-9 in each of the next two seasons before being fired. He was followed by Jerry Claiborne, who led Maryland to seven bowl games over 10 seasons. In a Twitter post, current Maryland coach Mike Locksley said of Mr. Lester: “He came up the ranks as a high school coach and took over during a tumultuous time. He laid the solid foundation for the Claiborne era.” After leaving Maryland, Mr. Lester returned to the high school ranks at Paint Branch (1972-1978) and then Magruder (1979-1993), leading Paint Branch to the Class B state championship in 1975 and Magruder to the Class B state championship in 1984 and the Class A state title in 1986. When he retired in 1993, Lester had won 260 games at the high school level. His son, Tom, described his father as a hands-on coach with a sensational personality that was suited for public speaking. “My dad was a molder of men. He loved his players — he never cut anybody,” Tom Lester said. “He trusted his players and was almost like a father figure to them. He just inspired people to want to go out and win.” In 2002, Richard Montgomery named its athletic stadium after Mr. Lester and he was a charter member when the school created an Athletic Hall of Fame in 2012. He was inducted into the West Virginia University Sports Hall of Fame in 2008. The school’s athletic director, Jon Freda, an alumnus who played football in the late 1990s, said Mr. Lester “had a God-like myth to him when it came to coaching football” that spread across all of Montgomery County. “As a young football player, you always heard about Coach Lester and how good his teams were,” said Mr. Freda, who has been the school’s AD since 2010. “And you would meet football players that played for him and you never heard a bad thing about Coach Lester. More to that, everybody spoke highly of him.” Mr. Lester remained involved with Richard Montgomery football until recent months, attending the team’s annual charity golf tournament last spring. In October, his son said that his father suffered a broken leg that started his slide. “He had a rough time the last year,” Tom Lester said. “What I get sad about is how people on Facebook and people I’ve known my whole life have reacted and how sad they are. That’s what really gets me because he made lifelong great relationships with all his players.” Later this week, Mr. Lester will be buried at Rockville Cemetery — less than 2 miles from Richard Montgomery — with only close family members at the ceremony. After the state’s social-distancing restrictions are lifted, the family plans to celebrate his life with a gathering at Roy Lester Stadium. Coach Lester’s daughter, Amy Lester Greco, said in a Facebook post: “How blessed I am to have been his only daughter. I am not a perfect person but everything good about me came from this beautiful man.” Survivors include two other sons, Roy Jr. and Christopher, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

Mosby, medical professionals ramp up calls for Maryland to release elderly and low-risk prisoners to stem coronavirus
.W
Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, defense attorneys, medical professionals and others are asking Gov. Larry Hogan to release certain older, immuno-compromised and parole-eligible prisoners as the state continues to battle the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The letter sent Monday calls on Hogan to release all prisoners who are 60 years old or older or who are medically vulnerable and have five years or less left on their prison sentence. The letter’s signers, which include the ACLU, Maryland Public Defender Paul DeWolfe and several Johns Hopkins professors, ask that a number of prisoners be released to probation services. Others that the group said should be eligible include those who have been deemed low risk by the Department of Public Safety and Corrections and have two years or less remaining on their sentence. The letter also calls for women serving “determinate” or fixed prison terms for minor crimes to be released to a probation sentence. Those in prison for felony crimes who would have opportunities to have their sentences reduced would not be eligible. The advocates argue that would allow the women’s facility to be repurposed to reduce density in other state prisons. “We must address these populations if we are to avoid the spread of COVID-19 behind prison walls,” the letter reads. “Aside from demonstrating compassion to people in prison, this measure is consistent with measures needed to protect the state as a whole.” A spokesman for the governor’s office did not reply to a request for comment Monday. During a press conference last Thursday, Hogan said of prisoners, “they’re safer where they are," even as calls to release some prisoners escalated. The letter, signed also by the Charm City Care Connection and Healthcare for the Homeless advocacy groups, is just the latest salvo in an ongoing push by advocacy groups to help reduce the state’s prison population in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Last week the Amercian Civil Liberties Union sent a similar request Hogan before joining the latest letter. Mosby has been particularly vocal. In a statement Monday, she praised Hogan for his “steadfast, courageous and decisive leadership” guiding the state through the first stages of the coronavirus. "However, the same prevention-focused logic the Governor employed when ordering people to socially distance, work from home, and not gather in groups of more than ten, must also apply to corrections personnel and inmates in prisons and jails,” Mosby said. "The broader community is under threat and a more comprehensive strategy is needed to protect the lives of our community at large.” As of Monday, the state has at least 288 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three people have died. Beyond his comment Thursday, Hogan has not responded to any of the calls for release or unveiled any measures to release lower risk prisoners from state facilities. Last week Mosby announced her office will stop prosecuting lower level offenses like drug possession and prostitution. Other prison systems have moved to reduce their populations to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus among inmates and staff. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said 23 inmates were set to be released Sunday and that 200 more were being reviewed for potential release, according to U.S. News and World Report. Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3 which represents some prison employees, said inmates at Maryland’s prisons are still being fed in large groups inside a dining hall. The ACLU, Maryland Public Defender’s Office and a number of advocacy groups sent the governor a letter last Wednesday asking for similar measures. Melissa Rothstein, spokeswoman for the state’s Public Defender’s Office, wrote in an email Monday that “there are more than 1,100 inmates over the age of 60 who are currently eligible for parole.” “The Governor and Parole Commission can, and should, use their authorize [authority] to provide for their immediate release,” Rothstein wrote. “The Parole Commission can also expedite release for people whose sentences will soon expire, and the Governor can use his clemency power to protect vulnerable inmates.” In addition to releasing prisoners, the group also asked the state to take additional steps to regulate Maryland’s prison facilities, including, providing sanitizing wipes at phone stations to reduce person-to-person transmission. The group said inmates should, when feasible, be provided “30-day supplies of medications to reduce contact and staff workload.” It also petitioned for lower density in prison yards, more access to showers for prisoners and that inmates who are “deemed medically high risk” be placed in single cells.

Maryland sees fourth straight day of declining new cases of coronavirus while matching single-day high for fatalities 
.W
Even as Maryland reported its fourth consecutive day of declines in new coronavirus cases Tuesday, the number who died since Monday matched the single-day high. The state health department said Tuesday that there were 709 new confirmed cases and 74 more deaths as a result of the COVID-19 illness. Tuesday’s numbers bring the state to a total of at least 27,117 infections and 1,290 fatalities. An additional 100 deaths are believed to be caused by the virus but not confirmed by laboratory tests. But as those counts continue to climb, Gov. Larry Hogan’s office has noted recently that the metrics it’s most focused on before beginning implementation of its reopening plan are hospitalizations and cases requiring intensive care. Both appear to have plateaued in recent days, though Hogan said previously a 14-day downward trend in those statistics and others would be required to lift stay-at-home orders and allow the state to begin reopening in stages. The state reported 138 new hospitalizations Tuesday, down from 148 Monday and 141 Sunday and the fewest in the past six days. The total number hospitalized, however, ticked up by 44 to 1,693, with 573 intensive care cases compared with 563 on Monday. Tuesday’s 709 cases were the fewest new confirmed cases in Maryland since April 28, though the 3,108 completed test results the state reported Tuesday also mark its fewest in that span. Before this stretch, Maryland hadn’t had more than two consecutive days in which the number of new confirmed cases was lower than the day before. Tuesday’s 74 additional deaths matched April 25 for the most Maryland has reported for one day and exceed the combined 60 deaths reported in the prior two days. The state’s 14-day rolling average of new victims hasn’t decreased from one day to the next since the start of April. The seven ZIP codes with the most confirmed cases are all in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, the only two of Maryland’s jurisdictions with more than 3,500 confirmed cases overall. Two ZIP codes in the Baltimore area, 21215 and 21224, are eighth and 10th, respectively, with 415 and 354 confirmed cases. For the first time since the state began reporting race data, the number of white victims in Maryland exceeded the number of black victims, though those who are white represent about twice the portion of the state’s overall population, according to U.S. census data. Among those whose race was known, African Americans account for about 43% of both the state’s infections and fatalities despite representing only 30% of Maryland’s overall population. About 10% of the state’s population is Hispanic, but nearly a quarter of Maryland’s confirmed cases are in that group. However, less than 2% of those 5,144 cases have ended in death. Those under 60 years old are nearly 70% of Maryland’s caseload, but almost 90% of the state’s victims were at least 60 among those whose age was known. A quarter of those 80 years old or older with a confirmed infection have died. Separately, Maryland officials launched a new online portal Tuesday where those in need of protective gear such as masks and gloves can find local sellers, aiding the hunt for critical items in short supply at hospitals and elsewhere during the coronavirus pandemic. Hogan has identified securing adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, or PPE, as a key pillar to his plan to lift distancing measures and reopen the state. The others are hospital capacity as well as adequate testing and contact tracing for those possibly infected with the COVID-19 illness. Hospitals and other facilities have their own supply chains, but they have been stretched to the limit by the pandemic. There are reports of nurses wearing then cleaning single-use masks repeatedly and doctors avoiding going bedside to preserve gear. The Maryland Manufacturing Network Supplier Portal is operated by the Maryland Department of Commerce and the Maryland Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The site won’t handle sales but can connect buyers and sellers so they make a deal offline, officials said. The state also has been buying and distributing protective equipment. Since March 27, officials report that a state task force has secured: 4.5 million KN95 masks, 3.5 million gloves, 1.1 million face shields, 600,000 N95 masks, 150,000 gowns, 47,000 gallons of hand sanitizer and 5,000 infrared thermometers. It’s not clear how much has been distributed and used, or how much remains in state warehouses. Hospitals are tracking the gear to make sure it goes where it’s most needed, but they go through supplies quickly dealing with the contagious respiratory illness. LifeBridge Health operates several hospitals and reports, for example, that it averages 4,500 N95 masks per week, 575,000 gloves per week and 45,000 isolation gowns per week. The portal can help fill more gaps, state officials said. Baltimore Sun reporter Meredith Cohn contributed to this article.

Reports: Kentucky Derby to be moved to Sept. 5 because of coronavirus pandemic; Maryland Jockey Club weighs Preakness options
.W
The Kentucky Derby will become the latest major sporting event postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to reports in the Louisville Courier-Journal and other media outlets. The Derby will be moved from its traditional date on the first Saturday of May, likely to Sept. 5, the reports said. Churchill Downs Inc. is scheduled to announce its official plans for the race on a Tuesday morning conference call. The announcement could lead to a similar postponement for the Preakness Stakes, traditionally run at Pimlico Race Course two weeks after the Derby. Representatives of The Stronach Group, which owns and operates Pimlico, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening. But a company spokesman said last week that The Stronach Group was closely monitoring the pandemic in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. In a statement Monday night, the Maryland Jockey Club said it is working “to determine the most appropriate time to conduct the Preakness Stakes.” “Our first priority in these difficult times is the health and welfare of our industry participants and the public at large,” the statement reads. "We are working with state and local governments, our industry participants, media and other affiliates to determine the most appropriate time to conduct the Preakness Stakes. While we are mindful of the challenges these times present, we also know that events like the Preakness Stakes can help restore our sense of place and economic well-being to our communities and state. As soon as we have further clarity on these matters we will inform all.” The Derby postponement seemingly became inevitable Sunday when the CDC published guidelines recommending an eight-week moratorium on gatherings of more than 50 people. The Derby regularly draws more than 150,000 spectators and ranks as Louisville’s signature civic and tourist event. The Derby was last postponed in 1945, during the last days of World War II.

Maryland confirms fourth coronavirus-related death on the same day it sees highest jump in confirmed cases 
.W
Maryland’s fourth death from the new coronavirus was confirmed Tuesday, with the announcement coming on the same day the state reported 61 new cases of the virus, its highest single-day increase. A Prince George’s County man in his 60s who suffered from underlying health conditions was the state’s fourth coronavirus-related death, the Maryland Department of Health announced Tuesday afternoon. Three of Maryland’s four deaths were men in their 60s with underlying health conditions, with two in Prince George’s County and the other in Baltimore County. A Montgomery County woman in her 40s, who also had underlying medical conditions, was announced Saturday as Maryland’s third death. The total number of cases statewide reached 349, a 21% increase over Monday, when Gov. Larry Hogan ordered the closure of Maryland’s nonessential businesses. The 61 new cases represent the state’s biggest one-day jump to date, said Mike Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman. Four of the cases are people under 18, up one from Monday. More than 80% of Maryland’s confirmed cases are in people between ages 18 and 64, who represent 283 of them. The remaining 62 cases are those who are 65 or older, the group that is considered most at-risk to the virus. Montgomery County has the highest number of cases Tuesday at 107, rising from 93 reported cases Monday. Prince George’s County saw the largest increase among counties, with 16 new cases bringing its total to 63. Baltimore County has 42 confirmed cases, one more than Baltimore City’s 41. It’s unclear how many tests for the virus Maryland is administering daily, as it is one of a few states not yet reporting those numbers, though health officials did early on in the outbreak. Ricci said via Twitter that Maryland has “started that process” to report negative tests, offering a better understanding of whether increases such as Tuesday’s indicate the further spread of the virus or simply a rise in the number of administered tests. Maryland updates its number of confirmed cases at 10 a.m. daily. Counties and local jurisdictions might announce cases separate from those confirmed by the state.

Alexander F. Gaskins, retired interior decorator and musician at area churches, dies of coronavirus
.W
Alexander F. Gaskins, who rose from an upholsterer to become an interior decorator and owner of his own firm, died April 19 from COVID-19 at Sinai Hospital. The former Ashburton resident, who was living at Lochearn FutureCare, was 79. “He was a gifted musician, and he knew how to bring out the best in everyone who was around him,” said the Rev. Dellyne I. Hinton, pastor of Gwyn Oak United Methodist Church, where Mr. Gaskins was a longtime active member. “Not only was he a first-rate musician, he had a talent for getting people to do things.” Alexander Franklin Gaskins, son of Howard Gaskins, a Crown Cork & Seal Co. worker, and his wife, Sidna Gaskins, a homemaker, was born in Baltimore, one of eight siblings. His identical twin, Andrew Samuel Gaskins, a retired vice president of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Maryland, died April 3. Mr. Gaskins was raised in Cross Keys, which in those days was primarily an African American neighborhood that took its name from an 18th-century inn on Falls Road. After graduating in 1958 from Frederick Douglass High School, Mr. Gaskins became an upholsterer and in the 1960s apprenticed himself to John Matthews, who taught him interior design. For years, Mr. Gaskins worked as an interior designer for Don Weber, whose Franklin Street studio, Don Weber Interiors & Antiques, was above Restaurante Tio Pepe. He eventually purchased the business from Mr. Weber and renamed it Interiors by A & A Gaskins. In 1977, the studio’s work was featured in a Baltimore Symphony Orchestra Decorators’ Show House fundraiser at Cedarwood, the 1927 North Charles Street Lawrence Hall Fowler home, which he designed for Alexander E. Duncan, founder of Commercial Credit Corp. Mr. Gaskins retired in the 1990s. A deeply religious man, Mr. Gaskins joined his family’s church, Orchard Street Methodist Episcopal Church, at an early age, family members said. An accomplished organist and pianist, he served as minister of music at the First Baptist Church, Garrison Boulevard United Methodist Church, Emmanuel Community Christian Church, St. Mark’s United Methodist Church and Gwynn Oak United Methodist Church, where he was a member. Mr. Gaskins was also gifted with a basso profundo voice and occasionally sang with the church choir. “He was also the director of the women’s chorus, men’s chorus and senior choir," Ms. Hinton said. “He was extremely gifted, and it was a joy to hear him play,” Ms. Hinton said. Wanda R. Robinson, a Pikesville resident and a friend of 35 years, said, “He did not play by ear but by notes. He was strictly professional.” Among Mr. Gaskins’ favorite hymns were “Lead Me, Guide Me" and the old spiritual “My Lord, What a Morning,” family members said. “We turned that hymn into a play and we’d perform it in area churches,” Ms. Robinson said. She said that Mr. Gaskins was her “prayer partner.” "If we were going through something, we’d pray together. He had formed a deep relationship with God,” the Pikesville resident said. At his church, Mr. Gaskins was chairman of the history committee. He chaired the Homecoming Committee twice and was a member of the Comfort Committee. “He was such a dedicated member of our church, and even though he left the city and went to live with his daughter, he still came back frequently as he could to attend meetings as long as his health allowed. He was just so dedicated,” Ms. Hinton said. “He such such a positive person and never said a negative word about anybody,” she said. “He was just a very, very kind man. He was well-liked at church and was just a sweetie.” “He was a pillar of the community and he’d transport friends or anybody to where they wanted or needed to go, vacations, to the doctor if they were sick or even New York,” his daughter, Anita Michline Kelly of Silver Spring, wrote in a biographical profile of her father. The former Egerton Road resident collected mirrors, his daughter said. “He was not a big reader or gardener. He just loved his church.” Because of the coronavirus pandemic plans for a memorial service are incomplete. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, Aaron Mark Gaskins of Catonsville; a brother, Thomas Gaskins of Nottingham; four sisters, Ann Carter, Brenda Williams and Pamela DeLoatch, all of Baltimore, and Colleen Cary of West Deptford, New Jersey; four grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews. His marriage to the former Miriam Smith ended in divorce.

‘It’s so aggressive’: Maryland nurse dies of coronavirus, leaving her son, also a nurse, sounding a warning
.W
When Liam St. John entered his mother’s hospital room in head-to-toe protective gear, his instincts as a nurse took over. He surveyed the accouterments of her medical care, the drips and the IV and the ventilator, and carefully read over the monitors showing her vital signs. It all seemed clinical, familiar. But when the goodbyes began, with him dialing in loved ones on a cellphone in a plastic bag, and playing recorded messages from his two kids in hopes their grandmother would somehow hear, all his medical training fell away, he said, and “a very different feeling” took hold. “Then you’re a scared kid who’s worried about losing his mom,” St. John said Monday, two days after his mother, Evelyn Caro, also a nurse, succumbed to the ravages of the coronavirus. “It’s just like a light switch, where it just really becomes real all of a sudden that you’re going to be saying goodbye.” St. John is still trying to wrap his head around what happened. It was so fast. He keeps having a dream in which his mother is trying to tell him something, but he can’t make it out over the din of the hospital. He’s mulling the role of health care workers like the two of them in this pandemic, recalling her pride whenever they chatted about their shared profession. He hopes sharing her story will help others avoid a similar fate, and get them to see nurses less as heroes and more as the most vulnerable among us — as reflected by a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate Tuesday that healthcare workers account for 10% to 20% of all coronavirus cases in the country. “It’s a nightmare, and it’s so fast, and it’s so aggressive,” he said of the illness caused by the virus. “This is not something I ever want anyone to go through. But if we don’t take this seriously, if we don’t limit ourselves, if we become selfish and just thumb our nose at this thing, it’s going to have some drastic consequences for people, and it’s going to be someone else’s mom, someone else’s sister, someone else’s grandmother.” St. John never thought it would be his mother, until it was. Caro, 69, was the life of the party, a tough but loving grandmother who was born in the Bronx to strict Puerto Rican parents and who had wanted to be a nurse ever since she left New York City to join the U.S. Navy at 19, said her son and her only sister, Patricia Caro. Even after she got pregnant, left the military and had three sons, whom she would go on to raise as a single mother, she "never let go of that dream,” St. John said. Through many tough years, when the family relied on public assistance, she always worked hard, her son said. She labored at a string of low-paying jobs, including in the medical field, before she finally caught her big break: a program for Holy Cross Hospital employees to go back to school for nursing. She took the leap, and finally realized her dream of becoming a registered nurse at the age of 50. By last month, Caro had been in the field for 19 years, and was working part time at a gynecology practice near Holy Cross in Silver Spring — which has one of the highest concentrations of coronavirus cases in the state. Ten days after feeling a slight fever, she was on her death bed at Johns Hopkins Hospital, intubated and depleted. On Saturday, with her lungs destroyed and her strength gone, St. John decided, along with other family members, and in consultation with her physicians, to take her off the various machines keeping her alive. “She looked like a shell of a person, and not the vibrant, beautiful woman that she is,” he said. “That’s not how I want to remember my mom.” Before the virus, Caro spoke her mind, and doted on her two chihuahuas — Dulce and Bori, short for “boricua" — at her home in Jessup. She had a habit of tossing things, anything, big things, on top of her head to make her grandchildren laugh. She would always go to the beauty parlor on Saturdays to have her hair and nails done, and was always in church on Sunday. She and St. John would often sit and chat over café con leche — always Café Bustelo — in her kitchen. Their work a constant source of camaraderie. “She and I could talk to each other as mother and son and as professional colleagues. She loved that,” said St. John, who works at a Baltimore hospital and lives in Columbia. “Being a nurse defined her. And unfortunately, being a nurse is what killed her, too.” St. John believes his mother contracted the coronavirus at the practice where she worked and was still going in two days a week. On March 18, she texted him: “Hey sweetie! My colleague is still under the weather! I’m going in tomorrow.” On March 26, the low-grade fever began. He texted, asking her if she had any shortness of breath. “Not to worry! I think it’s my allergies," she said. On March 27, she was tested for the coronavirus at a drive-through testing facility, but “the doctors kept telling her, ‘Keep an eye on things, and pushing fluids, and try to soldier through,’” St. John said. “We didn’t really think that this was going to be COVID, because you never do think it’s going to happen to your family." Over the next several days, her temperature would spike and fall, her condition worsening and ebbing. “Sometimes she would be feeling better, she would be on the phone with us telling us, ‘Oh it’s not that bad.’ Other times she was telling us she was afraid to move, or so sore she couldn’t get out of bed or change her sheets,” St. John said. On March 30, Caro texted her son again: “I’m scared! I’m hurtin really badly." On April 1, she told her son she was having trouble breathing, and that, on the little device he’d bought her to test the oxygen levels in her blood, the readings were startlingly low. He told her to call 911. “My last words to my mom were, ‘Just calm down, I’m on my way.’” By the time he got there, the paramedics were outside, taking off their protective gear, he said. “They had her in the ambulance, but I couldn’t open the door to see her," he said. Caro was put on a ventilator that day, existing in a twilight sleep or an even deeper anesthetized state for days as doctors, first at Howard County General Hospital and then at Johns Hopkins Hospital, tried all they could to save her. St. John said Caro had Type II diabetes and was overweight, which complicated her treatment, worked against the ventilator and undercut her recovery. On Saturday, St. John and his sister-in-law Jennifer Buckle, who also is training to be a nurse, were allowed into Caro’s room to say their last goodbyes — a final mercy after a week of forced distancing. They called Caro’s sister, Patricia, who was at home in Connecticut, distraught that she couldn’t be there for her only sister, the one who shared her voice and sense of humor, for whom she could never do any wrong. “I told her that I loved her, that I would honor her and her memory. I would continue being there for the kids. And I apologized to her that I couldn’t be with her there, but that I loved her, and that it was OK, she could let go, because we were going to be OK. We were going to be OK,” Patricia Caro recalled through tears. “This is a horrible, horrible virus that steals people’s last moments with their loved ones.” St. John also spoke to his mother. “I told her I wished she was strong enough to hold on, but that if she needed to go, she could go, that we would be OK, that we would take good care of her dogs ... and that she would always be part of our lives,” he said. She went quickly after that, he said. Dr. Darryn Band, managing partner of the Capital Women’s Care practice in Silver Spring where Caro worked, said she was “a valued member of our team and her loss will be felt by her co-workers and patients." After learning of her diagnosis, the practice “immediately notified the appropriate authorities and those patients who might have been impacted,” Band said. It also cleaned its offices in accordance with CDC guidelines, he said. “Our thoughts and compassion go out to her family during this most difficult time,” he said. Caro will be cremated, but it’s unclear what sort of services the family can have, or should have, given the circumstances. St. John still needs to find his mother’s will, and other important documents, “but at the same time you’re terrified to go into that house, because of what’s there,” he said. He struggles when he sees people still not heeding social distancing restrictions, who don’t understand when he tells them at his own hospital that there are new control measures in place, who lined his block with their cars on Easter Sunday, gathered together with the people they love. He is horrified by the suggestion that shutdowns should be lifted. “People don’t realize that we’re still right in the middle of it,” he said, frustration in his voice. "Everyone needs to treat this seriously. If they couldn’t do it for my mother, I wish they could do it for theirs.” The Associated Press contributed to this article.

As Maryland coronavirus cases surge past 5,500, schools prepare for possibility of online learning into the fall 
.W
Maryland saw its largest daily spike in new coronavirus cases Wednesday with more than 1,000 new confirmed infections, as the state’s top education official said she was preparing for the possibility that public schools could remain closed into the fall. The state announced an additional 1,158 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to more than 5,500 cases overall. The increase came after two consecutive days in which the number of new cases appeared to level off. Gov. Larry Hogan attributed the increase in part to an uptick in testing and commercial labs clearing backlogs of tests. Hogan said 30% of the confirmed cases added Wednesday were for tests performed in March. “The Baltimore-Washington corridor has become an emerging hot spot,” the Republican governor said. “An increase in new infections is just one of the reasons for today’s significant jump in new cases. This is also due to our ongoing efforts to ramp up testing in Maryland, with more private labs coming on board and the expansion of commercial lab capacity.” Maryland also reported 124 deaths from the virus, an increase of 21 from the total announced the day before. As cases continued to rise, the state’s top education official said public schools must be prepared to continue teaching classes online into the fall and winter, if the spread of the coronavirus continues or the virus makes a resurgence. Speaking to a bipartisan work group of Maryland lawmakers, State Superintendent of Schools Karen B. Salmon said she is ramping up online and distance-learning capabilities in case schools must remain closed into the 2020-2021 academic year. Some epidemiologists have said the state could see a second wave of the virus in the fall. “I’m not sure we are going to be doing school in the same way going forward,” Salmon told lawmakers. “We’re not sure that is not something that we’re going to revisit in the fall or the winter. I’m really focusing much of our resources on the expansion and accountability wrapped around online learning and distance learning.” Salmon has ordered schools closed through April 24 ― with an at-home curriculum beginning this week ― while state officials evaluate the spread of COVID-19. Salmon said the at-home work will count towards students’ progression in their respective grades. State officials emphasized Salmon’s comments were about preparation and not a prediction of when schools will or won’t reopen. Hogan said in a television interview that the state has not decided when schools can reopen or if they will remain closed for the rest of the 2019-2020 academic calendar. “We’re taking it on a week-by-week basis," he said. "We don’t know when this is going to peak and when we’re going to get back to normal.” Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, which represents the majority of teachers in the state, said that if distance learning needs to continue for months, a number of issues must be addressed. For instance, laptops are not available to all students and staff members, and there are gaps in the training that teachers need to do the work, she said. “This is showing us where our deficits are, which is good. If we are going to do this long term, we are going to have to do a lot to fill in those deficits,” Bost said. Salmon’s comments came during a meeting of the Joint Covid-19 Response Legislative Workgroup, a panel that is researching what steps the legislature can take to address the fallout from the pandemic. During the meeting, held virtually, Senate President Bill Ferguson said all 681 bills passed by the legislature during a shortened session that ended last month — including a sweeping overhaul of the state’s public schools — have been sent to Hogan’s desk for his consideration. The governor has 30 days decide whether to sign, veto or let bills become law without his signature. The work group, which is chaired by Ferguson and House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, also heard from Maryland Health Secretary Robert R. Neall. Neall said the health department has entered into an agreement with the University of Maryland medical school in Baltimore to form an initiative that can test up to 20,000 people a day. The results will help inform Maryland officials about when they can begin to lift restrictions on businesses and gatherings, Neall said. “We’re helping them stand up a testing facility that will have the capacity of 20,000 tests a day,” Neall said. “That will get us into the ballgame for widespread testing.” Neall also told lawmakers that the state now has at least 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Maryland’s nursing homes. Hogan announced Tuesday the formation of “strike teams” to bring state resources to nursing homes to try to limit the spread. The health secretary also told lawmakers the state now has 1,178 ventilators on hand, with more than twice that number ordered. Neall said state officials are beginning to receive shipments of protective gear and other supplies that they are delivering to counties in need. Despite the increase in cases, area hospitals said they are not yet overrun with patients. Bob Atlas, CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association, said the 26.5% jump in confirmed cases in the last 24 hours is “concerning,” but hospitals remain able to handle the surge. Atlas said the University of Maryland Medical System, MedStar Health, LifeBridge Health and Johns Hopkins Medicine are coordinating patients within their systems, as well as with state health and emergency management officials. That will help keep hospitals, including those closer to Washington, from becoming overloaded. Hospitals across the state are ramping up capacity, planning for treating patients within their walls and inside about 100 specialized tents the state has ordered. They are different from triage tents serving people who arrive at the hospitals for care. There also are two new hospital facilities in the works to accommodate hundreds of patients, one inside the Baltimore Convention Center and another at a shuttered hospital in Laurel. “We are getting close to full capacity, if you consider what’s normal capacity, in a couple of places,” Atlas said. “But they are not overflowing yet. ... So, it’s not the level of infection that leads to the kinds of news stories you see in New York. We hope not to get there.” During a Zoom presentation Wednesday to members of the Greater Baltimore Committee, Johns Hopkins Health System President Kevin Sowers said Hopkins has had confirmed 1,048 cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. It had 186 patients in the system as of Wednesday morning. Of those, 20% percent are on ventilators, which Sowers called a typical statistic in the U.S. and elsewhere. "We have not met our surge,” he told the business organization. Meanwhile, telemedicine visits have ballooned from eight patients a day to more than 1,200, Sowers said. “Out of something really horrific that is happening in our world, this will also force us to look at ways that we can change and become better at delivering health care services to our communities” in the future, Sowers said. Dr. Brian Garibaldi, director of the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit, said the hospital was taking some of the sickest patients from the more heavily hit Washington suburbs. The hospital has added multiple ICU units to treat COVID-19 patients and has staff that has trained for years for such a pandemic. Garibaldi said there have been about 100 ICU patients in recent weeks with close to 40 now. Many more are being treated outside of the ICUs. “We’re not overwhelmed," Garibaldi said, "but we certainly are very, very busy and it’s no longer business as usual.” Baltimore Sun reporters Liz Bowie and Lorraine Mirabella contributed to this article.

Maryland preparing for possible extended shutdowns of schools, businesses, events as coronavirus spreads
.W
People in Maryland and across the country know the drill when a big snowstorm is coming: Stock up on toilet paper, nonperishable human and pet food and needed medications. As a new coronavirus wallops the rest of the world and makes inroads in the United States, officials are pointing to that kind of preparation. Canceled events, school and day-care closures and direction to work from home “are the kinds of things people should plan for,” Gov. Larry Hogan said at a news conference this week. The outbreak may pass without mass closures or quarantines, and for now local and national officials maintain the risk is low. But as they prepare for more infections, they say individuals should, too. There are at least 80 people across the country infected with the new coronavirus, and on Sunday, health officials in Washington state announced that a second person has died of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the second such reported death in the U.S. Three people are awaiting test results in Maryland. Two others in Maryland tested negative. But if infections become widespread and people are quarantined for two-week periods or longer, authorities may decide to shut schools, businesses, airports and governments for a time. Prep kits with food and prescriptions are tangible things people can put together ahead of government orders, officials say. They can also wash their hands and take other steps to prevent infections generally, including the seasonal flu that is widespread now. So far, the reaction in the United States to the coronavirus has included dumping stocks and hoarding masks, which likely do little to protect healthy people and contributes to shortages in medical offices, said Michael Runnels, associate professor of law and social responsibility at Loyola’s Sellinger School of Business. He said this activity comes in the absence of a clear message from President Donald Trump and his administration. Runnels pointed to statements this week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that COVID-19 is certain to spread, and statements from Trump that it’s largely contained and not certain to spread. “It’s something of a corporate, a business response so far,” Runnels said. “But if infections come here, local government will step in if there is still a gap at the federal level. They will begin shutting things down. It’ll be like when Baltimore had that really big snowstorm.” For now, nothing is closed, but there are local ripples. Day cares are reiterating policies on when children should stay home, universities are calling home students studying in heavily affected countries and the port of Baltimore reports reduced hours because of declines in cargo from China. There could be shortages at the local pharmacy of medications for common ailments like high blood pressure and bacterial infections because many drug ingredients are produced in China and manufacturing has been curbed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported there already is one COVID-19 related drug shortage, though it didn’t identify which one. Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen signed onto a letter Friday to the FDA questioning how the agency plans to address the issue. When it comes to closures, it’s not yet clear who would make a final determination on which facilities and businesses would shutter and when. State Superintendent of Maryland Schools Karen B. Salmon said school decisions would be made between her and the state Health Secretary Robert R. Neall. "We are really looking to the health department on this as the lead to this,” Salmon said. The health department and governor’s office did not respond to request for comment about the process. Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, the health officer for Anne Arundel County, said the response to a case would depend on factors such as the health of the people exposed to the virus and where the infected person works. “The details really matter,” Kalyanaraman said. “What we’re trying to do is convey that our response to any situation is dependent on the specifics.” The state health department has said there has been considerable planning in Maryland for health effects, and Hogan plans next week to request $10 million in emergency funding based on that planning. “The State’s preparedness builds on decades of planning, experience and expertise gained from previous public health events such as SARS, MERS, H1N1, Zika and Ebola,” said a statement from the health department about the virus. State Senate President Bill Ferguson said the legislature is committed to working with the Hogan administration to amplify a coordinated message. "The biggest concern we have right now is the panic,” Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, told senators Friday morning. “It is really important we are prepared, in case there is an issue with the virus, we are ready to handle it.” Public health experts say transparency and clarity will be key going forward to gain public trust if extreme measures are needed to stop virus spread. Unlike during the last pandemic that heavily affected the United States, the 2009 H1N1 flu, there isn’t likely to be a vaccine ready to combat COVID-19 soon, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease doctor and scientist for the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health in Baltimore. He was a principal investigator on the vaccine trials for the H1N1 pandemic, also known as swine flu, and Chen said a vaccine was ready in months. Scientists prepare a new flu vaccine every year with new strains, and there is an established system. A vaccine for the new coronavirus is in the works, in part through the work of University of Maryland researchers and based on an existing coronavirus vaccine. However, Chen said, it’s unlikely to be ready this year, partly because there is no established system or manufacturers at the ready. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said as much during a news conference with Trump last week. He said a vaccine could be used if there is an outbreak next year, though a treatment could be ready this year. Chen said the state and federal governments will need to rely on other methods that some may find “draconian" if the outbreak becomes a pandemic. “We need to be very transparent with the public and tell them why we are doing these things,” Chen said. “Some may interpret them as draconian, and others may say they sound reasonable. But there will be no public trust, or cooperation, without transparency that starts early on.” He said that’s what the CDC intended with its comments, to ensure such measures don’t come as a shock. Chen said there are several possible scenarios with the virus. One is that the virus is contained through measures such as travel bans and quarantines overseas before it’s widespread in the United States. A second is that it continues over weeks and months into a pandemic that is far harder to contain. And a third is that the infections abate in warmer weather, much like the flu, then return with a larger wave in the fall. Those in Maryland are preparing for any scenario with a lot of local infections. Hospitals are laying out plans to operate with fewer medical staff and send office staff home to telework, said Dr. David Marcozzi, who is in charge of COVID-19 preparedness for the University of Maryland Medical System. Hospitals already were prepared to quarantine patients, but now there are protocols to care safely for COVID-19 patients, who could grow rapidly in number. They also are evaluating circumstances in which health professionals could forgo masks, gloves and other protective equipment so they can be stockpiled, as supplies are becoming low. “We know this will be coming to Maryland. The question is how large of an impact will it have,” said Marcozzi, also associate chair of population health in the Maryland medical school’s department of emergency medicine and assistant chief medical officer for acute care at the University of Maryland Medical Center. “Our plan not only speaks to care for our patients, but our facilities,” he said. “Everyone needs a plan: schools, businesses, community leaders, city and state leaders. Things like telework don’t happen overnight. You need to plan." It’s the same story at local schools, where officials said they are coordinating with local health officials. “We are very closely monitoring the development of the virus,” said Charlie Herndon, a spokesman for Baltimore County schools. “It’s a matter right now of getting as much information as we can.” Filipa Gomes, supervisor of health services for the Carroll County schools, said officials are emphasizing precautionary measures similar to those used to prevent the spread of flu — such as washing hands with soap and water and coughing into a tissue. The Baltimore City school system is following the direction of the state health department and has handed students a fact sheet in English and Spanish, said Gwendolyn Chambers, a schools spokeswoman. The Howard County Public School System has developed an infectious-disease response plan to deal with flu that will be used, according to spokesman Brian Bassett. The response plan calls, for instance, for different levels of cleaning at schools with large numbers of cases of the flu. Anne Arundel County Public Schools have been developing a plan to teach students via telecommunication since the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, spokesman Bob Mosier said. Students at every level have access to Microsoft OneDrive and Google Classroom, where they can receive documents, instruction and turn in assignments from home if schools were to shut down. “Those conversations have cropped up in the last month about what we would do, not only with teleinstruction, but with students who didn’t have access to computers at home,” Mosier said. Educators are discussing options like lending students the Google Chromebooks they often use in the classroom. Officials from Harford County schools did not respond to requests for comment. Some schools could close, as they did in 2009. Acting on recommendations from the CDC, then-Gov. Martin O’Malley closed several schools where students were suspected of being sick with H1N1. The University System of Maryland also began preparations. Presidents of the 12 campuses were briefed last week by university experts, said Joann Boughman, the senior vice chancellor for academic and student affairs. The campuses have begun to explore ways to have classes go online if students need to stay home or if classes are canceled. UM presidents have wide latitude to make decisions for their individual campuses, including when to close down their campus, said Mike Lurie, a spokesman for the system. “It is also clear that any decision to close a campus due to a health emergency would be made in coordination the governor’s office and relevant state authorities.” Boughman said the best way forward is clear communication. “If the people in leadership feel they are prepared, then it brings down or helps reduce the fear and eliminates the sense of panic," she said. "I think continuous calm but substantial communication is one of the greatest assets we might have.” Baltimore Sun reporters Colin Campbell, Pamela Wood and Lilly Price contributed to this article.

Batavick: Daily life will be forever changed by coronavirus, extended quarantine 
.W
My astute wife has drawn a parallel between the COVID-19 pandemic and the alien monolith in the 1968 film, “2001: A Space Odyssey.” The mysterious column’s appearance changed everything for a group of hominids at the beginning of the movie, inspiring them to use a tool that, eons later, evolves into space travel. That’s a tall mission statement for our current alien invaders, but I understand what she means. The arrival of the coronavirus and our current state of extended societal quarantine promise to radically alter many facets of daily life. Here are some of them: Businesses are gaining a better appreciation for teleworking, and the size of many on-site workforces will change. This will impact our use of space — from city skyscrapers to suburban business parks, thus changing what architects are asked to design, how real estate is valued, the size of new construction, and even traffic patterns with less congested highways. It will take a long while before the cruise ship industry recovers. No one wants to be adrift on a quarantined ship. Many seniors will be rethinking leaving their secure houses and moving to group residences and/or nursing homes where contagion is happy to find a toehold. Colleges, now forced to use distance learning, will make it a bigger part of their curricular offerings, thus shrinking on-site attendance and endangering some smaller institutions. People who planned to retire in the next few years will seek to work longer to rehab their devastated 401(k)s. Some movie theaters will never reopen. People who have become accustomed to watching films at home will think twice about sharing close spaces in the dark. Substitute “arenas and stadiums” for “movie theaters” above and you understand the potential impact on sporting events and music concerts. For college football and basketball, decreased attendance threatens the viability of the less glitzy athletics they fund, like tennis, baseball, swimming, and golf. Nonprofits and museums will be further challenged. While some have exploited the internet to stay in-touch with and engage members, others will need to reinvent themselves or face extinction. More churches may resort to offering online worship services. My wife and I have been attending Mass in an upstairs room with a big-screen TV. We use monthly electronic giving as our way of contributing, but churches that depend on the collection basket are surely feeling the pinch. Rogue nations have easily seen the impact of tiny pathogens on powerful military powers and will push investment in biological weapons. They are much cheaper than developing uranium centrifuges and intercontinental ballistic missiles. There will be a boom in artistic creativity to more than rival all the humorous/clever pandemic jokes and videos we’ve exchanged online. Look for a future onslaught of disease-themed novels, films, TV shows, music, art, and poetry. In the past, pandemics have spurred the creation of great literature, from Boccaccio’s “Decameron” and Shakespeare’s “King Lear” (both written during outbreaks of bubonic plague) to Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America” (authored during the AIDS/HIV epidemic.) There will be continued interest in backyard gardening and home cooking. This should have a positive effect on youngsters and perhaps future generations. Despite offering home delivery and take-away opportunities, some of our favorite restaurants and food shops may never recover. Tight spaces and quarantine are forging stronger family relationships but may also lead to an uptick in the divorce rate. Look for a jump in birth rates come December and January. Not everyone is assembling jigsaw puzzles. Because of the explosion of home baking (just try to find some flour and yeast in stores), there will be a boom in attendance at gyms and fitness centers that rivals the weeks after the Christmas holidays. Though the sheriff’s office reports a decrease in crime, there’s most probably an increase in alcoholism, drug use, depression, and domestic abuse that we’re not hearing about yet. Doctors, who have discovered the benefits of telemedicine, may adopt it as one of their permanent offerings when you make an appointment. Certainly, the above musings are a mixed bag, and I hope I wasn’t being too pessimistic. However, there’s no denying the pandemic’s profound and perhaps long-term impact on our world. Lastly, I wish to do a shout out to the original creators of the internet and those charged with keeping it working during a period of record traffic. I cannot conceive of how we would have coped in isolation without Zoom, Netflix, TikTok, FaceTime, YouTube, Google, and all the other marvelous apps at our fingertips. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Frank Batavick writes from Westminster. His column appears every other Friday. Email him at fjbatavick@gmail.com.

Maryland to bump salaries of frontline workers in coronavirus crisis; rates still below double pay received earlier
.W
Maryland’s state government is offering a pay bump to certain state employees who must work through the coronavirus pandemic. The offer of $3.13 per hour in extra pay is significantly less than the double-time rates the state paid some workers before discontinuing that policy more than a week ago. “While this differential is not equivalent to the premium pay that the state provided to employees at the onset of this crisis before universal screening and other safety protocols were put in place, it is designed to be sustainable for the state given the unknown duration of this health crisis,” Cynthia A. Kollner, the state’s director of personnel, wrote Wednesday in a letter to union leaders. The $3.13 hourly bump in pay amounts to about $250 extra for each two-week pay period, starting Wednesday. “We estimate that close to 15,000 employees will be eligible to receive this differential,” Kollner wrote. Eligible employees include those “working in 24/7 operations” in the Department of Health, Department of Juvenile Services and Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, as well as state police officers and firefighters, Koller wrote. Human services workers will be paid extra when doing field work, but not when telecommuting from home. State employees required to work in “designated quarantined areas” will receive another $2 extra per hour in pay. The estimated cost to the state is $3.7 million per pay period. For now, the extra pay will be in effect through May 5. Some state workers and advocates have raised concerns about the conditions employees are exposed to, particularly in the state’s prisons and psychiatric hospitals, where inmates and patients have the COVID-19 disease. State officials have said they’ve taken appropriate measures to protect workers and limit the spread of the virus in state facilities. Union officials, especially from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 3, have said the measures are insufficient. The extra pay is appreciated, but employees need safe working conditions, said Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3, the largest union for state employees. “It’s a step forward, considering they took a giant leap back,” Moran said of the pay increase. “We’re talking about people that are doing their best in a very dangerous and scary situation. We need to make sure that people are compensated for the risks they are taking.” Moran said availability of protective equipment like masks and gloves is extremely limited in places like prisons and hospitals where social distancing is impossible. During a news conference earlier this week, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan acknowledged that there is not enough personal protective equipment for people who need it, including those who work at state facilities. “We do not have enough gear. No one in the country has enough gear. That’s the No. 1 problem in America right now that everyone’s talking about,” he said.

West Carroll: In the coronavirus pandemic, is this ‘writer’s garret’ big enough for the two of us?
.W
This time last year, we were wondering if spring would ever arrive. This year, at least for me, weather is insignificant compared to the coronavirus crisis. As a writer, I have a “writer’s garret” set up with all the comforts (and easy access to the refrigerator). I worked on my manuscripts during school hours. I was comfortable with this arrangement until the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, caused the closing of all public schools statewide on March 12. I suddenly found myself sharing my space with a teenager. I needed to get a handle on the situation before it got out of control. We sat down and made a schedule that mirrored her daily school routine. It included five-minute breaks between classes and a generous lunchtime. It was the perfect combination of learning and recreation. Of course, as Robert Burns, the national poet of Scotland, wrote in his poem “To a Mouse”: “ The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men Gang aft agley…” (translated as the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry). My carefully detailed plan to survive the time school was to be closed were vaporized by day two. I now began to worry that I may have to homeschool. I was not prepared or trained for that reality. I prayed that, if the schools remained closed, a distance learning option would be available. I have music on in the background, listening to the big-band sounds of Glen Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman and Count Bassie. Occasionally, when Nat King Cole or the Andrews Sisters comes on, I hear my teen singing along. I’m not surprised when she announces she likes “swing” music. I am lucky to have internet access. I can access a myriad of websites bursting with ideas for upcoming novels as well as fact-checking everything I hear before passing it on. I continue to stay in touch with friends and family on a global scale through the various social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. The world at my fingertips! One change in my routine came with the closing of the library. I read a lot across all genres.  When schools closed, I didn’t realize the libraries would close as well. I found myself without any books to read. I researched an alternative outlet and found that, if you have a valid library card, you can access the Maryland Digital e-Library Consortium, at https://maryland.overdrive.com/, where you can  join a book discussion, listen to an author interview, or check out an e-book or audio book. We have plenty to keep us busy. Yet there is a silence that comes with the COVID-19 crisis that is deafening. My teen plays varsity lacrosse for the Francis Scott Key Lady Eagles. The team had won their preseason scrimmages and were pumped for the regular season to get underway. But now there is no afterschool practices. No team bonding time. For the parents, there is no sitting in the stands together cheering our girls on as we enjoy watching them play lacrosse, a game we have grown passionate about watching as much as the girls have become passionate about playing. Has the COVID-19 pandemic changed us in some way? Absolutely! I’d be lying if I said it didn’t. We fill up the hours we normally would spend writing (for me) or in school (for my teen). While we are still living life to the fullest (as best we can), we can’t help but be just a little on edge. We continue to remain positive with high hopes the situation changes for the better soon.

Baltimore family, reeling from daughter’s killing, struggles to provide funeral in era of coronavirus restrictions 
.W
Shannon Barmer had just started a new job and things were going well for the 22-year-old, her family said this week. She’d begun fulfilling the “dreams and goals” she’d had since graduating from Milford Mill High School in 2015, her mother, Shelleye Barmer said. Then Friday night, as Shannon Barmer sat in a car in the 1900 block of E. Oliver St. waiting for a friend, those dreams ended. Her family said a stray bullet from a firefight struck their daughter; police are keeping mum on any details or motives. “Everybody is shocked,” Shelleye Barmer said. “I don’t know how I will get over it. Her oldest sister cried for two days since she’s found out.” The family’s sudden, overwhelming grief has been compounded in recent days as they try to make arrangements and provide the proper “home-going service” she deserves in this time of the coronavirus. Instead of a large group of friends and family mourning the young woman, Shelleye Barmer is navigating new rules that are still being clarified and interpreted, funeral service directors said. Although funeral homes are considered “essential businesses” under Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s recent order, many of them across Baltimore say they are adapting to changes, including how many people are allowed inside the building during operational hours and changes to the way funerals and memorial services are conducted. Brittany Green, the managing funeral director at Vaughn Greene Funeral Services, said the funeral home is “adhering to the guidelines out in place,” which it recognizes could be affecting families in “many ways.” One of the most important things businesses can provide right now is guidance, Green said. “This is fluid and involving,” Green said. “Of course none of us have all the answers, but we are being forced to develop a novel response — which means providing the best guidance we can and to guide families during a difficult time.” Michelle A. Greer, an attorney and cousin of Barmer’s, said funeral arrangements are still pending with the Joseph H. Brown Jr. Funeral Home. Greer said it has been “taxing” on the whole family already dealing, like many others, with the stress and restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Some family members will not be able to attend the memorial service, Greer says. Several of Barmer’s old classmates and friends have called to say they may not be able to pay their respects, she said. Greer says the family now can offer only a viewing with a limited crowd and cremation. “Aside from the normal process of just grieving and what it would be under normal circumstances, that is taxing enough. But now we are also dealing with the restrictions in place,” Greer said. “Under normal circumstances, there would be a funeral and burial. But now, my aunt and uncle are being forced to do cremation. I know that is something my little cousin would not have wanted.” Shannon Barmer was born and raised in Randallstown and graduated from Milford Mill High School in 2015, and was most recently living in the Windsor Mill and Woodlawn area. She started working at MTA Mobility this month, her mother said, after previously working in the day care business. A Facebook post on Barmer’s page says she started work March 14, less than two weeks before she was gunned down. Her cousin, Brianna Greer, said Barmer often spent holidays with her family and described her as a “beautiful person." Barmer was also the godmother to her son. Families and funeral directors across Baltimore are adjusting to the new rules, and helping each other get through difficult times, they said. At Wylie Funeral Homes, only two people are allowed to come in to plan arrangements. Viewings are limited to 10 people in the building at a time, Tinika Coleman, the Wylie funeral director, said. Coleman said she understands the difficulties all of this is causing families — families are giving her helpful feedback — but nothing can be done. “It’s just at this time, knowing we are in a state of emergency, we are going based on what the laws are. It is unfortunate during a time of loss that you still have those same regulations, but it is just for their safety and ours,” Coleman said. The Barmers are learning this new system while realizing that the violence that has shaken Baltimore for so long hasn’t changed. Shelleye Barmer said she already lost a nephew, Davron Dorsey, 21, after he was shot and killed June 27. Baltimore City “knows its [gun] violence problem,” Barmer said. The coronavirus, state and local restrictions won’t change that, she added. Several recent shootings support that. On the same day Shannon Barmer was killed, Corey Augustus, 33, was shot and killed in the 3600 block of 5th St. On Monday, 18-year-old Riyad Campbell was shot and killed in the 2400 block of Tolley St. “There are still innocent people and young people getting murdered, but no one seems to know how to approach or handle it,” Shelleye Barmer said. “I’m lost without my daughter. I can’t replace her. The city needs to step up their crime plan. This happens every day and I’m mad.” She is now hoping to do “as much as I can” in remembrance of her daughter’s life. The family started a GoFundMe for donations to Barmer’s funeral services.

Campaigning in the time of coronavirus: Baltimore mayoral candidates embrace hand sanitizer, the elbow bump
.W
Politicians on the campaign trail are all about shaking hands and kissing babies. But with heightened concerns about the new coronavirus, Baltimore’s mayoral candidates are making some adjustments. They’re arming themselves with Purell, going for the elbow bump and reminding both voters and volunteers to get any symptoms checked out. Others are talking about how they’d handle the crisis if they were in office. Retail politics is king in Baltimore, said Mileah Kromer, director of Goucher College’s Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center. When voters have face-to-face contact with a candidate, she said, it motivates them to get out and vote. But amid fears over the highly contagious virus, Kromer said, “people are changing their behaviors — and campaigns are no different.” Former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign said Wednesday it was calling off large events in Illinois and Florida as he fights for the Democratic nomination. His campaign instead plans to hold “virtual events.” Maryland Sen. Mary Washington, a mayoral candidate, then announced Thursday her campaign would cancel all events for at least the next week in light of concerns over the virus. “We are listening to medical professionals in doing our part to practice social distancing and slow the spread of the virus as we fully evaluate the situation," she said. So far, several mayoral campaigns said they are not scaling back on door-knocking strategies or planning to miss large forums and events. But they’re preparing for how they might respond to a global pandemic that already is affecting life in Baltimore, with cases cropping up in Anne Arundel and Harford counties. Roughly 950 people in the United States have contracted the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and more than 25 have died. There are more than 118,000 cases worldwide, and more than 4,000 deaths. When Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young was out campaigning over the weekend, he followed up every enthusiastic handshake with a squirt of sanitizer for his hands. “It’s not for me, but for them,” he said. “I want to make sure that I’m not passing germs on to them from other people who shake my hand, as well.” He said it’s difficult balancing a competitive campaign while he leads the city amid coronavirus concerns. Young said he’s working with the city’s health commissioner and state and federal partners to provide a stream of information on the virus’ potential impact and how to best keep from catching it. He held a preparedness exercise Tuesday to work through different emergency scenarios, and briefed the media along with members of his cabinet Wednesday. Young announced plans to postpone his upcoming State of the City address in light of coronavirus concerns. “We’re all working together, and we’re updating everything as we get it,” he said. City Council President Brandon Scott, another Democratic mayoral candidate in the April 28 primary, called for a hearing on how Baltimore plans to respond to the illness. His campaign spokesman, Marvin James, said senior members of Scott’s team met this week on how to weather the impact on his campaign. They have to consider, for example, that people may want to talk through their screen doors rather than get up close with strangers who are out knocking on doors to drum up support for Scott. The campaign put together a flier for its volunteers, telling them how to protect themselves and others against COVID-19. “Please cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when you cough and sneeze, especially while speaking with voters,” it reads. "Clean and disinfect your clipboards, pens, and/or phones before and after your shift.” State officials have warned people who are over 60 to stay away from large crowds, because research has found that age group to be most at risk of getting very sick from the illness. The Maryland State Board of Elections issued a statement last week reminding voters that anyone who prefers to vote from home can request an absentee ballot, and they don’t need to give a reason to get one. State officials are also now in talks on how to hold a mail-in only election for the primary, should it become necessary as the illness spreads. James said the Scott campaign is contacting voters over 60 to remind them about their options. “Of course, because older voters are more susceptible, campaigns need to be more vigilant in making sure they’re fully educated,” he said. Older residents also tend to be the most loyal voters, and active campaign volunteers. Former Democratic Mayor Sheila Dixon, running to reclaim her position, said Young’s administration has not been visible enough during the outbreak. She said she would have put together a preventative action and emergency plan earlier, "not to put people in a panic state, but put people in a conscious state.” She said her campaign sent a person home after they came in coughing, and staff is wiping down surfaces every day and night. “I would encourage seniors to vote absentee,” she said. Former Baltimore Police spokesman T.J. Smith said he’s “doing a lot more fist bumps” as he meets with voters to convince them he’s the best choice for mayor in the Democratic primary. Candidates have always had to be mindful of hygiene, he said, even before the coronavirus. “I’m paying attention to all of that anyway,” Smith said. "But yes, it’s a little bit of heightened sense of anxiety now with the amount of hands we have to shake.” Washington, another mayoral candidate, said it’s so natural to extend her hand for a handshake as a means of offering respect and building trust. But she knows she needs to “abide by the recommendations to really reduce skin-to-skin contact,” so she does the elbow or fist bump instead. “I kind of make a joke about it and say, ‘This is what we’re doing. We want to stay safe,'” she said. She said Thursday her campaign is evaluating its canvassing strategy. Former state Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah said his campaign will film its events and stream them online so voters can watch from home. His campaign also said Thursday that it would use its prominently displayed billboards across Baltimore to transmit the message: “Stop the Virus. Wash your Hands." Colleen Mattingly, a spokeswoman for mayoral candidate Mary Miller, said the situation is an “example of why Baltimore needs strong leadership with experience bringing a variety of players to the table to quickly manage a crisis.” She pointed to Miller’s experience as a U.S. Treasury official in the Obama administration, working on the country’s economic recovery. Democratic Del. Terri Hill of Howard County, a physician who ran recently in a special primary for Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, said the candidates don’t need to cancel public events across the board. But they should contemplate more seriously which ones are worth holding. Hill said she would consider transitioning to more teleconferences and telephone town halls, although they can be costly to set up. If a candidate is holding an event, Hill said, volunteers need to be vigilant about sanitary practices. Candidates also might consider having staffers sign in guests, rather than have each attendee sign the same sheet of paper with the same pen. “One of the issues we’re not seeing people pay enough attention to are microphones,” Hill said. “You have to take precautions there. Advise them not to touch the microphone, and before and after, try to sanitize by wiping them.” Kromer cautioned no one really knows now what kind of impact the virus could have on the election. “Everyone is always looking for the next thing in political swag," Kromer said. “If I was running a campaign, I’d get branded hand sanitizer.” Baltimore Sun reporters Luke Broadwater, Alison Knezevich, Emily Opilo, Tim Prudente and Pamela Wood contributed to this article.

Howard County teachers union supports school system’s coronavirus distance learning plan
.W
When Howard County high schoolers and middle schoolers begin distance learning in April, they will receive weekly assignments for all subject areas every Monday and have the week to complete them. Throughout the week, students will have opportunities for virtual check-ins with their teachers where they can ask questions as they spend the majority of each day completing the various assignments. All assignments will be found on Canvas, an online learning management system. On Wednesday evening, following state schools Superintendent Karen Salmon’s announcement that the statewide public school closure would continue through April 24 because of the coronavirus health emergency, the Howard County Public School System released its next phases of continuous learning despite not being in the classroom. On April 14, Howard high school students will begin their distance learning. Six days later, on April 20, middle school distance learning will begin. Elementary level distance instruction will be rolled out if the state decides to close schools beyond April 24. “I want to acknowledge first that I share many of the same frustrations that I have received,” Howard schools Superintendent Michael Martirano said during Thursday’s virtual Board of Education meeting. “There are many who have contacted me to say that we should go ahead and put materials out [before April 14] and then worry about the students who may not have technology access or receive special education services. With one in four of our children living in poverty, requiring special education services or needing language supports, that is just not possible,” Martirano said. The Howard County Education Association released a statement late Wednesday night in response to the school system’s distance learning announcement, stating, “We agree with the time allocated over the next few weeks for training and supporting staff, as we move into these uncharted waters, will lead to better instruction.” The teachers union “appreciate[s] the school system’s measured approach and will continue to work with them to support all of the students we care deeply about,” union President Colleen Morris wrote in a statement posted on the union’s Facebook page. While teachers, paraeducators and other educational staff are trained in face-to-face instruction with students, it “is not easily transferable especially in the early grades and with students that need extra support,” Morris wrote. Martirano thanked and commended all school staff who have worked over the last few weeks to implement the continued learning plan, as well as those disinfecting all 77 schools and school buses and those serving free meals at the distribution sites. Howard schools’ spring break from April 6 to 13 will go on as scheduled for students. All school system staff will be engaged in professional learning activities during spring break, having April 9 to 10 and April 13 off. Morris acknowledged the shared sense of “confusion, uncertainty and isolation associated with this pandemic” in her statement. “We promote diversity, equity and inclusion for staff and students,” she wrote. “Listening to the loudest while including those with the least opportunity to speak takes time, patience and room,” Morris added.

Makai Cummings hopeful City boys lacrosse progress can withstand coronavirus layoff: ‘It’s really hard’
.W
The uphill battle for Baltimore City lacrosse programs is nothing new. Funding, interest and consistency are just a few of the annual obstacles. Few hurdles, however, have threatened the building process for the area’s programs quite the way the shutdown surrounding the coronavirus has. City lacrosse senior Makai Cummings is among the success stories being derailed by the unforeseen circumstances. During the preseason, before games were postponed, he had returned to the field for the Knights after rehabilitating a knee injury to serve as a leader for the team. Committed to play club lacrosse at Morehouse College in Georgia next year, Cummings was ready to take center stage at City this season. “I tore my ACL over the summer. I’ve been working really, really hard to get back this season and I’m in the best condition that I’ve ever been in all of my four years of high school,” Cummings said. “So, for me not being able to play my senior year and this being my best year of lacrosse — just with my stick work, my body shape — it’s really hard. "This is a great group of guys that we’ve got this year. We have a lot of new and young talent. It’s just hard with this whole coronavirus thing and not being able to play this season.” For years, Baltimore City public schools have been looked at as a “lacrosse desert.” Programs have been underfunded, uniforms tattered and torn, padding and sticks worn down. Backing from booster programs is nowhere near what you see in surrounding counties. That doesn’t mean there aren’t beacons of hope. City coach Anthony “Merc” Ryan’s Blax Lax program has risen in the city for training the new wave of lacrosse players. Ryan coached City to a 12-2 record last season, winning the Baltimore City boys lacrosse championship and reaching the 3A quarterfinals. Cummings was preparing for his fourth year as a starter on defense for City. Last year he was a key piece for a group that outscored opponents 147-64. In nine of the team’s 12 contests, the defense held teams to below five goals and six of the nine games were shutouts. “I see the trend from my freshman year to my senior year. For one, we don’t have a lot of support coming from the outside,” Cummings said. “As far as money-wise, we wear the same pads pretty much, unless you buy your own stuff. They don’t put a lot of money for equipment or production and we don’t get a lot of media coverage. The sport has really grown, as far as skill-wise. That’s because during the offseason, we all like to come together and work out together and practice. No matter which school that you’re from." Ryan’s City team has seen fluctuating numbers over the years, with many players switching between sports during the summer. This spring, because of the shutdown of all athletic activities, his team might lose an entire season and the summer training along with it. The summer program is in jeopardy as well. “This is the first time in 31 years that I haven’t been out there in the spring,” said Ryan, a standout at Morgan State in the 1980′s when the Bears had a varsity program. “So, it’s greatly affected me. It’s a huge a gap. I plan my year to get ready for high school lacrosse during the season. Of course now, it’s kind of hard to find something to do without lacrosse and the kids themselves. I thought that I’d have a pretty good squad coming back. We had about 10 days of practice before all of this came out." As much as Ryan feels for his top seniors like Cummings, he hurts just as much for the up-and-coming players on the team. For them, many of whom don’t play year-round, a month or two off is crippling to their development and the continued development of the program as a whole. “I think about my seniors, and I didn’t have many of them ... but for them this was a season that they were taking to really prove themselves," Ryan said. "They were looking to go to college and so on and so forth and maybe a kid that didn’t get that much playing time — this was a year to really to put his knuckles in the dirt and get ready to play the game as hard as he possibly could.” While not officially canceled, the prospect of playing games this high school season is bleak. The earliest games could be played under the current timeline is early May. Cummings, however, is holding out hope. For now, Cummings has picked up classes online provided by City to finish his high school diploma. The instruction, which started last week, takes up roughly three hours a day and he said it has been a difficult transition so far. “It’s hard when you when you’re trying to do work in your bed or in your house because you’re not as motivated to do the work that I do in school,” Cummings said. “A lot of the teachers are not really doing a good job at keeping the work up to date and keeping the students involved in it. It’s just a lot and it all just came out of nowhere and not many people were ready for it.” He’s also doing his best to keep up with his practice schedule by playing wall-ball and keeping in shape with his home weights in his garage every day. He also goes running, but he hasn’t been able to go to the park and shoot on a goal during the outbreak. Regardless of what happens in terms of this season, there’s definitely still lacrosse in Cummings’ future. Taking his talents to a historically black college, he wants to see the game grow for black kids and the universities that they attend. “It’s become more popular among black people and not just white kids,” Cummings said. “And now because of Baltimore City, we’ve got kids that want to play in college, but aren’t getting the recruiting to play at Hopkins or Maryland and anything like that."

Baltimore County Public Schools decline to pay bus contractors during coronavirus shutdown
.W
Bus contractors serving over 110,000 public school students in Baltimore County will not be paid during the school system’s coronavirus shutdown. Jess Grim, transportation director of Baltimore County Public Schools, told bus contractors the district cannot pay those who service “regular routes, outside of our contract,” during the closures, according to emails obtained by The Baltimore Sun. Grim told contractors they would get payment Thursday for work completed through March 13, the last day before Maryland initiated school closures in response tothe pandemic. The “vast majority” of bus drivers in Maryland’s third-largest school district are employed directly by the school system, said Baltimore County Schools spokesman Brandon Oland. The county has paid drivers who are school district employees during the shutdown, but Oland said drivers for the county’s 149 contracted routes will not receive payment after March 13. “Beyond that, the federal and state governments have implemented programs to support private businesses and their employees and the scale of those programs is well beyond the capacity and obligation of county government or us,” Oland said. Students aren’t traveling for school, field trips or extracurricular activities at this point, so, Oland said, “there’s really no services” that the district needs from bus contractors at this time. He said there’s no language in their contracts that would suggest Baltimore County Public Schools is committing a breach of contract. Baltimore County Public Schools is dealing with an “unprecedented, unexpected” challenge caused by the pandemic, Oland said, but he stressed the agreements between the school district and bus contractors “weren’t written with any provisions to support business overhead or employee wages during a crisis like this.” Meanwhile, Carroll County Public Schools is paying bus contractors in full for nearly everything other than fuel during this time, according to a school system spokesman. A Harford County Public Schools spokeswoman said the district will continue to pay bus contractors at least a portion of what they would have made if the pandemic had not interrupted the school year. Grim told contractors via email that drivers could file for unemployment. He also encouraged them to reach out to his office to address “individual or collective concerns.” Although Oland said they expect and hope their bus contractors will return if school reopens April 24, some contractors said they dislike Baltimore County’s approach to the issue. “[Grim] had the audacity to send me a link for where to get a small business loan for $50,000, and that wouldn’t cover a month’s payroll,” said Robert "Squeak" Edwards of JDT Transportation. Edwards has bus drivers in several counties, including 12 in Baltimore County. He feels bad for his Baltimore County drivers and has helped them qualify for unemployment assistance. He said he would have used Baltimore County’s compensation for bus payments, insurance and rental space for the vehicles. Additionally, Edwards said the school district put out a bid for new bus contractors this month. The bid was released in the middle of an existing contract with JDT Transportation and several other bus companies that is set to expire in June 2021. Edwards said he thinks the county should withdraw its new bid and honor the last year in the contract rather than having existing contractors rebid their services. Likewise, Ron Prettyman of Whitcraft Services Inc. said the school district’s decision has created a “burden” for their company. He said his company stepped up to provide temporary relief to the county during a driver shortage the last week before schools were closed. “We enjoyed helping the county when they didn’t have enough drivers. It was a team effort,” Prettyman said. “I don’t, however, understand how the decision was reached that we wouldn’t be provided any portion of payment, for the drivers and infrastructure that made us a valued member of their team just days before.”

I am a doctor treating coronavirus patients - and expecting a baby | COMMENTARY
.W
Emergency room physicians such as myself are adept at operating under demanding circumstances, but nothing could have prepared me for the onslaught of COVID-19. Especially because with a baby due in two months, I am not only protecting my life and the lives of those I serve — I am protecting my unborn child. Every day, I walk into the hospital knowing that I am not alone. When I feel my baby kick while at work, it’s a sharp reminder of the responsibilities I hold both as a front line provider and a mother. In addition to my baby girl on the way, I have an 18-month old daughter at home. I am constantly preoccupied not only by my increased risk, but also the thought of my future child being born prematurely into a hospital full of very sick people, potentially with limited resources. The stress of being a pregnant mother on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis can be overwhelming. Simple activities such as drinking enough water on a shift are more difficult as I am constantly wearing a mask or a respirator. Every day is a constant battle between my duty to patients and protecting my children at all costs. My plan now is to be as present and careful as possible until I reach a point that the risk is too great. In addition to protecting myself at work by remaining diligent with my personal protective equipment, I also have to think about if a health emergency does arise. I am helping my patients navigate this process by thinking about goals of care, what they would want done in a health crisis. I urge them to have honest and frank conversations with their families. As visitor access becomes increasingly restricted and our medical facilities and providers are overwhelmed with patients, advance care plans give patients a voice in their care, even if a times comes when they are unable to communicate with caregivers. These directives also help ER physicians like me make care decisions quickly, which allows us to provide expeditious, quality care when it matters most. I am having to make these tough decisions for myself as well. The current crisis prompted me to sit down with my husband and tell him what is most important in my life, what I would want done if I were to become sick and how to protect our baby if I was critically ill. These are difficult conversations but must happen ahead of time and are something people of all ages should consider, especially as we combat this pandemic. As a practicing physician, and as an expectant mother, I see every day how crucial this kind of planning is for my work and for my own health and well-being. For myself and my patients, I recommended going to CDC.gov to find state specific plans, or a free, online platform such as MyDirectives.com to create an advance care plan that can be easily and securely updated to keep everyone on the same page. While the situation that I and my pregnant colleagues are in is unique, to simply be pregnant in this global crisis is a challenge in and of itself. Many mothers will not be able to have their loved ones beside them when they deliver. Hospitals have already banned visitors from sitting in on ultrasounds and checkups. Though this is for the best, it is still another tragic loss amid this pandemic. I hope these mothers know that the doctors and nurses caring for them understand the fears and anxiety surrounding pregnancy and labor, especially in this time of crisis. Mothers like myself are strong, and we will survive bringing new life into this world, even during a pandemic, with strength and courage. Despite the many challenges coronavirus has brought on, it has not negatively impacted how I feel about my profession. I have been struck by the tenacity, compassion and community that has emerged as a result of us dropping everything to save fellow human beings. People often ask me what it is like to work in an emergency room, and I tell them I see the extremes of human nature. We witness people in their lowest and most vulnerable moments but are also present for the beauty and infectious energy of hope, love and resilience. I am beyond blessed to have the love and support from family and friends who remind me that they are praying for me and that they are so proud of the work I am doing. Dr. Elizabeth P.

Carroll County runners doing what they can to stay sharp, in shape during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Kathryn Hopkins put together a standout indoor track winter season at Winters Mill High School, and the junior said she was looking forward to building on that this spring. Same goes for Century’s Hayden Hebert, a fellow junior who, like Hopkins, also shined in cross country back in the fall. Carroll County’s distance runners, along with the rest of their track and field cohorts, were met with a collective challenge last month when the coronavirus pandemic resulted in school being canceled and sports being wiped out. Schools are closed through May 15, and the likelihood of spring sports resuming is bleak. But county runners are still doing their best to stay sharp, and in shape. “It was pretty upsetting, because I think I probably could have done a lot in the spring season,” Hopkins said. “But it’s still an opportunity to keep training and prepare for cross country.” Hopkins won regional and state championships in the winter when she took first in the 3,200-meter run at the Class 2A West and 2A state meets. Her win at states, in 11 minutes, 25.36 seconds, was a personal record, according to athletic.net. Hopkins took second in the 3,200 at the Carroll County Athletic League meet, where she also finished runner-up in the 1,600. Last fall, Hopkins ran second at the CCAL cross country meet, third at regionals, and second at states. The Times first-team all-county runner said not being able to practice with Winters Mill hasn’t been ideal, but she’s doing what she can to remain active. “I still run six days a week, but I have taken more time to do strength training and core stuff too,” Hopkins said. “Just to keep injury prevention.” Hopkins said she rests on Sundays, but gets in 30 or more miles each week, and she figures that number will keep going up as the summer months approach. “If we were with the team, we’d probably do two workouts a week but I’m just doing one a week right now,” she said. “Just a little bit less.” Meanwhile, Hebert said he is running 3-4 miles per day, and he tries to get outside five days a week. High school tracks might not be the best place to train right now, but Hebert said he tries to visit local trails so he can get into the woods for his runs. The reigning Times Boys Cross Country Runner of the Year was runner-up at the county and 2A West meets last fall, and sixth at the 2A state meet. He won the 3,200 county title for indoor track and was second in the state, while running third in the 1,600 at regions and states. Like Hopkins, Hebert said he’s “bummed” about the possibility of no spring sports, but he’s doing what he can to stay positive. High school stadium tracks aren’t the place to be right now for local runners, but Hebert said he has taken to some nearby trails so he can get into the woods to run. “I’m just trying to keep up my miles, keep my endurance going,” he said. “So I don’t get out of shape over this long break. I need to stay strong and look forward to the next time I get to compete.” Liberty track coach Amanda Milewski, who also coaches cross country at Carroll Community College, said she has been emailing her Lions runners workouts to do twice each week. Milewski said being able to run, regardless of the fate of a spring season, sets up distance athletes well for summertime and the following cross country season. “I wanted to remain hopeful in this situation,” Milewski said. “Any time school closures are extended, to me, it’s still like a little bit of a glimmer of hope. Maybe there will be something; I’m trying to remain optimistic.” Time away from daily practices and weekend meets might also give runners an extra period to rest nagging injuries. And teammates are using their cellphones and other devices to stay in touch and do strength and conditioning workouts together. Hopkins said she runs with her sister Makenzie, a former Times Girls Cross Country Runner of the Year, but she’ll be looking to get some rest as well before cranking things up again for the summer. She said she was excited about trying to lower her long-distance times on the track this spring, but it’s looking more like Hopkins’ next challenge will be out on a cross country course. “I don’t feel the pressure to be doing as much speed stuff and constantly running a lot [every] day, because there are no meets,” she said. “It’s really just about staying in shape.”

Ravens GM Eric DeCosta on trading away Hayden Hurst, dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and more
.W
During a six-day span last week, Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta finalized three trades. The first made headlines: The team was acquiring Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end Calais Campbell, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, for a fifth-round pick. But DeCosta’s second and third deals were in some ways just as notable — one because of whom he was dealing, and the other because of whom he was dealing with. On Monday, in his first public comments since the NFL’s new league year started Wednesday, DeCosta explained the mechanics behind the trades that sent tight end Hayden Hurst to the Atlanta Falcons and defensive end Chris Wormley to the Pittsburgh Steelers. DeCosta told the team website that both Hurst and his agent had expressed a desire after the season for the 2018 first-round pick to “get out on the field and contribute and show the world what he can do.” DeCosta said Hurst “loved it here, of course” — he’d grown especially close to the team’s other tight ends, Pro Bowl selection Mark Andrews and playing-time leader Nick Boyle — but that he would welcome the chance to play elsewhere. At the NFL scouting combine last month, DeCosta recalled, he started to have “preliminary” discussions about Hurst with Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff. With Pro Bowl tight end Austin Hooper headed to free agency, Atlanta would likely soon have a need at the position. “As other teams look at our roster, they would see that [Hurst] was the guy that was playing with some other really good players,” DeCosta said. “And teams look at your strengths on your team and sometimes will ask about players. And Hayden was the guy that sometimes teams would ask about. And so I made the decision ... that if a team was able to match what I would consider to be fair compensation for Hayden, that we would consider trading him.” DeCosta said that while there were “probably three or four teams in the mix” for Hurst, the Falcons emerged as maybe the most interested suitor. With Atlanta’s proximity to Hurst’s hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, and the chance to get more snaps in a pass-happy offense led by star quarterback Matt Ryan, DeCosta said he had the chance “to put Hayden in the position where he was going to succeed.” In exchange for Hurst and a fourth-round pick in next month’s draft, the Ravens acquired 2020 second- and fifth-round selections. “And because of that,” DeCosta said, “I think Atlanta made a lot of sense.” DeCosta joked that it didn’t hurt that the Falcons play in the NFC. Of course, scheduling concerns didn’t keep the Ravens from sending Wormley to the Steelers, only the second trade ever between the AFC North rivals. Salary cap considerations motivated the decision, DeCosta said Monday, hours before the Ravens re-signed cornerback Jimmy Smith and defensive back-linebacker Anthony Levine Sr. But an apparent philosophical shift was a factor, too. “We felt like that we were going in a different direction, maybe, on the defensive line," said DeCosta, who also has designated Pro Bowl outside linebacker Matthew Judon with the franchise tag and agreed to a three-year deal for defensive lineman Michael Brockers this offseason. “If we had the chance to trade Chris, it would be a tough call. But what I try to do is have a value in my mind and weigh that with the team.” Ultimately, he said, the salary cap relief — Wormley was set to make $2.1 million in 2020 — and the arrival of a fifth-round pick made the deal “something that we felt like we should probably do.” “You can’t second-think anything, and you just go through [with] it,” DeCosta said. “We thought it was a good decision for us at the time. We still stand by it. I think Chris is a good, young player, and I think his best football is probably ahead of him. But for us, where we are as a team, we felt like it made the most sense.” Coronavirus concerns Across the NFL, the coronavirus pandemic has forced the cancellation of college pro days, restricted travel and limited access to team facilities. “This is a challenging time,” DeCosta said Monday. He acknowledged that the Ravens would have to adapt to the league’s new realities as free agency continues and the draft approaches. “We can’t do the things that we’re accustomed to doing, we can’t be meeting with these players, we can’t be working out players, we can’t be visiting with players, so what are the things that we can do?" said DeCosta, adding that he expected to be “more hands-on” in the predraft process. "We’ll take advantage of those things as best as we can.” Among the challenges for NFL scouts and officials, according to DeCosta: fewer interviews and medical rechecks and less workout data, especially for prospects who didn’t participate in postseason all-star games or the scouting combine. “So what are we going to do? We’ll have a plan," DeCosta said. "Rest assured, I’ll be watching every single player in this draft and go back to my days as the college scouting director. And we’ll work together, and we’ve got a great staff of people. And even if we can’t be together [at the team facility in Owings Mills], we can get on the phone, we can work remote, we can video-conference each other, and we’ll make the best decisions that we can for this club.” Extra points >> DeCosta said he’d hoped to complete a deal for Campbell before the start of free agency Wednesday. Fortunately, he had a willing trade partner in Jaguars general manager Dave Caldwell, whom he called a “really good friend." (Their relationship dates as far back as their days as competing scouts.) By trading for Campbell, DeCosta said, “you have a little bit of an advantage over these teams who are all competing for the same players. My fear was that if we didn’t get out early to make a move, then there’d be a lot of multiple parts that we’re trying to juggle, and it becomes a lot more difficult.” >> Asked whether the Ravens now would seek a replacement for Hurst in the draft, DeCosta pointed to the team’s wealth of returning talent on offense and said that there are “many, many ways we can score a lot of points." DeCosta did, however, acknowledge that the team would add skill-position players “at some point” in the draft, but did not elaborate on what positions or how high in the draft. >> With nine draft picks, including five in the first three rounds, DeCosta wouldn’t rule out trading up in the first round from the No. 28 slot. “I love to move around the board, as you guys know, and we’ve done that as much as probably any team in the league over the last 24 years, and we’ll continue to do that,” he said. “I’m open for business at all times.”

‘We depend on this’: Baltimore’s musicians and venues threatened by, persevere through coronavirus
.W
The coronavirus was a faraway concern when the Baltimore-based indie pop act Lower Dens launched its tour around Valentine’s Day. But by the time they played the Pacific Northwest, they noticed a drop-off in attendance at shows. Highways, roads and department stores were largely empty. “We had a whole other week of shows booked, and about [a] third of our tour income was supposed to come from those shows,” Lower Dens member Jana Hunter said. The group tried to continue with gigs in Canada, but diminishing audience turnout and concerns about the international border closing—which it since has—prompted them to head back. They suspended the rest of the tour, including a gig at The Ottobar in Charles Village this past Saturday. “Even before the coronavirus, it [was] so hard to make a living doing this and every bit of income counts,” Hunter said. It’s even harder, multiple musicians and people in music-related businesses told The Baltimore Sun, when COVID-19 makes it impossible to do the things that generate most of your income. Their situation remains precarious under orders like Gov. Larry Hogan’s recent one, informed by federal protocol, that limits mass gatherings to 10 people. “People who are not musicians or are not artists don’t realize that we depend on this financially,” Eze Jackson said. The rapper saw all of his March shows in the area get canceled over venues’ evolving concerns. He estimated that he’d lost between $3,000 and $5,000 this month alone. Ami Dang, who plays a unique mix of Indian classical and avant-garde electronic music, said that she lost over 20 shows. She noted that the cancellations mean losing not only ticket revenue, but the majority of merchandise sales. While fans can continue to support artists by buying merchandise and music from their websites or Bandcamp pages, the earnings don’t compare with what’s possible on the road. “There’s nothing like the actual pay I get from playing shows and the merchandise I sell,” she said. “I don’t make money any other way through music, so it’s a big hit." These visible impacts also set off a cavalcade of other concerns for artists that are not always visible to outsiders. “If your main resources are coming from your music work, and you are solely a small business, then what liabilities do you have?" explained Adam Holofcener, the executive director of Maryland Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts. “Are you the type of musician that employs other people? Do you have a sound person that comes on tour with you? Do you have other musicians who were supposed to come on tour? What contractual arrangement do you have with any of them?" Hunter noted that obligations like these can require payment upfront that cannot be replaced if there’s no tour income. He added that many artists’ tour insurance policies won’t necessarily cover the costs lost due to an event as extraordinary as a coronavirus outbreak. The crisis’ impact on national events is also felt by local artists. Richard Croce, who raps under the moniker MC Bravado, partnered with Brandon Lackey of the Lineup Room recording studio on a panel about hip hop and education at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. Both their panel and another planned music showcase they organized were canceled when organizers unprecedentedly called the entire gigantic festival off. “We pretty much had to walk back everything, financially,” Lackey said. “Some stuff we were able to get back, some stuff we weren’t.” While some sponsors have been understanding, the pair had to deal with the stress of getting money back on flights, hotel rooms and other affiliated costs. The pair tried to bide their time with a music video shoot for a song off MC Bravado’s upcoming album, but they don’t even know if the chaos will subside enough to shoot by April. “Even the album stuff, we’re just getting done what we can get done in terms of mixes, content and the presentation ready for a rollout,” Bravado explained. “But then we have to figure out if the nature of that rollout’s going to be drastically changed because of this.” The impact extends to places where musicians work and perform, including venues and studios. Tecla Tesnau of The Ottobar described a “domino effect” in which acts postpone or cancel tours, venues have to refund ticketholders and little new revenue is coming in to offset the cost. Things slowed down after the first few days of this effect, and she’s found ways to try and help employees during the downtime—including donating 100% of online Shopify sales to employees—but things are still difficult. “There was a minute there where I was pretty scared, I’m not going to lie, because we were hemorrhaging money for refunds,” she said. “It was pretty harrowing the first couple of days.” Lackey lost money from canceled studio bookings, and J. Robbins of The Magpie Cage Recording Studio said that clients have postponed, but not outright canceled, their sessions “out of an abundance of caution." While he’s cushioned with some work on different musicians’ projects, he understands that many artists aren’t as lucky. Some of his own gigs, both solo and with the veteran hard rock band Jawbox, are indefinitely postponed. “People might not be aware of the extraordinarily tight margin on which most creative people live,” he said. “The people who are lucky enough to support themselves in the arts, that’s not a job where you can just get unemployment benefits." Several people who The Sun interviewed also noted feeling the moral weight of creating spaces where people could potentially congregate and, if infected with COVID-19, hasten its spread. Dang observed that this can also lead artists to turn away from their creative and professional paths. “It only takes a couple of excuses to be like, ‘Oh, this is not worth it, this is not what I should be devoting my life to doing,’" she said. In the face of these seemingly impossible odds, musicians and other artists do have limited recourse. The downtime can give them space to create. Holofcener said that his organization is still doing referrals and consultations for artists requiring legal support. Organizations like the Creative Alliance are creating ways to make sure musicians can safely perform in open spaces. And artists are crowdsourcing and organizing to help one another. For example, performance artist and production consultant Alanah Nichole created an emergency fund to help other affected artists. “Larger institutions weren’t necessarily set up for those types of quick responses,” she said. So far, her fund has already raised nearly $4,000 and disbursed $1,800 to 48 people. It’s not a replacement for steadier work that’s threatened as the arts sector and others that employ artists, such as the hospitality industry, suffer. But it is a “morale boost,” Nichole said, for people who might not otherwise expect or ask for help. Nichole hoped that this fund would show the need for institutions to fund emergency preparedness for artists. Other interviewees hoped that the coronavirus illuminated the importance of fairly compensating art and artists for the long term. “Some people don’t want to pay $5 or $10 at the door, and I don’t think they realize,” Jackson said. “You might see that’s $10, but for me, that’s a sandwich. That’s $10 toward a phone bill or a light bill.”

H&S Bakery in Baltimore is hiring to meet increased grocery demand during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Baltimore-based H&S Bakery plans to ramp up production and hire workers to meet a surge in demand for bread and rolls as the new coronavirus has spread. The commercial bakery in Fells Point said Friday it wants to hire more than 50 workers to meet the needs of its Baltimore-area grocery store customers. Stores have scrambled to keep bread in stock as shoppers buy up supplies soon after they’re delivered. The bakery’s need for workers comes as employees at restaurants, shops and other businesses have found themselves out of work because of a cascade of shutdowns in recent days. H&S said it is looking for both temporary and permanent employees for its five Baltimore-area operations, including its Fells Point bakery headquarters, Mid-Atlantic Baking, Crispy Bagel, Schmidt and Automatic Rolls of Baltimore. The company said its current employees have “stepped up to the challenge of the last few weeks, getting to work and putting in required hours in order to ensure local groceries and communities have access to bread during these uncertain times.” Openings include salaried management, supervisor and engineering jobs with benefits as well as general help with no prior experience required. The company and its affiliates are comprised of 14 divisions in seven states, with distribution in 23 states. H&S is also working to provide thousands of free loaves and bread products to families and workers in need through groups such as Meals on Wheels, Moveable Feast, Our Daily Bread, Baltimore Hunger Project, My Sister’s Place, Living Classrooms, Weekend Backpacks and others. Job applicants are asked to email HR@nefoods.com for details on how to apply online.

UMBC student reflects on death of renowned professor from coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) campus got sad news this week that research professor Maurice Berger died from complications caused by COVID-19 at just age 63. As a UMBC student watching President Donald Trump insist on pushing for schools and bars and restaurants to reopen, I can only imagine the decimation and loss of the American population we will continue to see. Contrary to the current administration’s rhetoric, the economy is not worth the lives of thousands. The amount of fear my generation has lived through is almost unimaginable. I’ve feared that the government wouldn’t protect me against gun violence as school shootings took lives of students my age in classrooms just like mine. I’ve feared that the government would roll back legislation protecting women and minorities, like me. And I’ve feared that the government wouldn’t protect our world against climate change and melting ice caps. I feel that same fear right now, struck by Professor Berger’s passing. I can’t help but see the obvious parallels as students like me return home to parents often in the same age range as Professor Berger, worrying about the safety of our parents and loved ones, some of whom may be younger but still vulnerable to the disease. This is a life or death issue, and we can’t even rely on our president to be honest and empathetic. In the face of disaster, he is doing the wrong thing, yet again, and it’s costing more lives. And there will be more deaths every day. I’ve watched helplessly as innocent people have fallen victim to the neglect of this administration simply not doing enough. And my fears are quickly coming true with this pandemic. As Liberty University in Virginia reopens its doors to its students, and President Trump says he wants the economy back up and running by Easter, we are rapidly moving backward, undoing everything our doctors and health care workers are working to accomplish. And, when asked if doctors on Mr. Trump’s team endorsed easing federal guidelines regarding the pandemic, he responded, “Not endorsed.” As UMBC’s administration quickly tries to put together information for students and to support them individually, it is easy to see how small we are in the grand scheme of things. But with the passing of Professor Berger, a renowned art curator and historian, communities from all over the country responded with resounding sadness. Though I didn’t have him as a professor, my heart goes out to his family, and everyone at UMBC, as the loss of any community member leaves a gaping hole on our campus. Things are extremely severe all over the world with no signs of stopping or slowing down. This is not the “seasonal flu” as Mr. Trump says it is. As we all know, contrary to the president’s beliefs, he is not immune to the virus, though he tested negative. And even his Mar-a-Lago resort was forced to follow federal guidelines and closed its doors just a few days ago. Things won’t be OK or even normal for anyone for a long time. That much we must accept. And the fact of the matter is that the American people who are privileged enough to have paid time off do not have to wait for shelter-in-place legislation to stay inside. And you don’t have to take it from a 20 year-old college student, though I’ve been covering COVID-19 since it hit the United States for our newspaper. Experts at the World Health Organization agree that the United States could easily become the next epicenter of the pandemic. And the growing numbers are a “severe undercount” according to Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the former Maryland health secretary. Hearing about the deaths as numbers often stops us from realizing that each individual had a life, and people who cared about them. As the deaths rack up, we must remember that the numbers are people. They deserved to live. And the only thing you and I can do is stay inside. We do not have to wait for the leadership that will not come and has not supported us for a long time. There is no time to waste. And though I didn’t know Professor Berger personally, as the death count rises, by the end of this, I’m sure I will know someone who has died from this pandemic. Possibly even another UMBC community member. Staying inside is absolutely the least we can do, and we do not have the time to waste listening to leadership who I’ve learned will not support me, my family or the rest of the nation during the worst disaster I’ve seen in my 20 years.

U. of Baltimore law professor John Bessler, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s husband, leaves hospital as he recovers from coronavirus 
.W
John Bessler, a University of Baltimore law professor, has been released from a hospital where he was being treated for low oxygen and pneumonia as a result of the coronavirus, his wife, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, said Thursday. Klobuchar, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said in a statement that Bessler “took a good turn, was just released and is now recovering at home." “Thanks to those who cared for him and for all front line health care workers,” she said. Klobuchar announced Monday that Bessler has the coronavirus and was admitted to a Virginia hospital where he was placed on oxygen, but not a ventilator. Bessler became ill when he was in Washington and Klobuchar was in Minnesota, she said. He initially thought he had a cold, but quarantined himself immediately anyway. He got tested after he began coughing up blood, and was admitted to the hospital, where he was put on oxygen but not a ventilator. Klobuchar said earlier this week that she and Bessler had been in different places and she was outside the 14-day window for getting sick, so her doctor advised her not to get tested herself. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Klobuchar said Monday that it took five days for Bessler to be tested, noting that such delays are a problem facing many. Bessler has taught at the University of Baltimore School of Law since 2009. According to a bio on the university’s website, he teaches courses in civil procedure, contracts, capital punishment, international human rights law and other topics. He is also an author. During Klobuchar’s campaign for president, he was often by her side. When Klobuchar was in Washington during impeachment proceedings and couldn’t campaign in Iowa herself, Bessler and the couple’s daughter acted as her surrogates, and met with countless Iowa voters on her behalf.

Baltimore’s drive-thru coronavirus testing site at Pimlico will open Friday
.W
Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said the city’s first drive-thru coronavirus testing center at the Pimlico Race Course will open Friday morning. Pimlico is in the heart of the city’s heaviest hit ZIP code: 21215 in Northwest Baltimore, which has 64 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and where about four in five of the area’s residents are black. Baltimore launched an online dashboard Thursday that breaks down the numbers of local cases by ZIP code. Maryland’s health department has not yet made that level of information publicly available. Young said that until the city gets more testing kits — they are in limited supply across the country — it would be “premature” to open up any additional drive-thru or walk-in sites. For now, residents are asked to call 211 to begin the process of securing an appointment to get tested at Pimlico. People will be screened on the phone about their symptoms, and if they meet certain criteria, they can be referred to the site by a doctor. Walk-ins won’t yet be accepted. “We are excited to be able to offer this service to city residents as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic together,” said Dr. Letitia Dzirasa, the city’s health commissioner. The testing site is expected to be open Sunday through Friday. Young initially said it would be able to run 50 tests a day, but officials indicated Thursday that testing resources are still somewhat in flux. Young said during a news conference that he was pleased the state released preliminary data on the racial breakdown of cases. He and other lawmakers have been calling for such numbers to be made public, so that disparities can be spotted and addressed. Maryland’s numbers followed a pattern that’s been emerging across the country: Black residents are disproportionately falling ill and dying of the virus. Dzirasa said the city only received data on the race of Baltimore patients Thursday afternoon and will be updating its dashboard to reflect those numbers. The city’s population is more than 60% black. “We’ve always tried to target our messaging at the populations we know are most vulnerable,” she said. “We’ll look at the data now that we have the race data down to a jurisdictional level.” Baltimore has 638 confirmed cases — about 10% of those reported in Maryland — and 13 people have died in the city. Other Baltimore ZIP codes with a high number of confirmed cases are 21206 in Northeast Baltimore and 21224 in the southeastern part of the city. Those areas have 43 and 38 confirmed cases, respectively. Maryland has opened several drive-thru testing sites at Motor Vehicle Administration emissions stations, including Bel Air, Glen Burnie and Waldorf. Another drive-thru center opened at FedEx Field in Landover. Prince George’s County has the highest number of confirmed cases in the state: 1,476 as of Thursday.

Jail population needs to be reduced to prevent spread of coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby took decisive action to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus through our jail by declining to prosecute low-level charges, including drug possession and prostitution. The Police Department is also encouraging officers to limit arrests accordingly. As a retired police officer and former prosecutor, I applaud their action to protect public health and safety and hope others will follow suit. Like nursing homes and cruise ships, jails can be incubators for infection. A newly arrested person may show no signs of infection, but can still spread the virus to unsuspecting law enforcement personnel, jail staff, visitors and other inmates, all cycling in and out of close quarters. A jail infection problem would rapidly turn into a community infection problem, accelerating the spread of the virus throughout Baltimore. The potentially deadly virus has already been contracted by several Baltimore police officers and some inmates in Maryland’s prison system. We need to prevent further spread. The only practical way to slow the spread of the virus in jail is to reduce the jail population by prioritizing cases that truly threaten public safety. With the Maryland State Police, I worked long-term undercover assignments, at one point infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. I saw that while some of our undercover cases brought down large-scale criminal organizations, other cases simply led to the arrest of small-time drug sellers, who were quickly replaced. We were putting our officers at risk to make arrests that had no impact on public safety. Police and prosecutors know which cases are top-priority, and now is the time to act on those priorities. Nearly 60 inmates have been released from Baltimore city jails and prisons (after bail reviews) because they were low-risk offenders, the Maryland Judiciary Office of Public Affairs said last week. That was the right thing to do, but more could be done. Limiting prosecutions of low-level crimes balances the threat to public safety from crime with the threat from the virus. Baltimore prosecutors will also dismiss charges for minor offenses that do not endanger others. These include trespassing, minor traffic offenses, controlled substance possession, prostitution, open container violations and urinating in public. While they may be minor offenses, they take up a surprising amount of police and prosecutor time and resources. The Baltimore City Police Department has quickly moved to collaborate on this issue. The department has directed officers to use discretion in these cases to reduce arrests in the first place. Keeping these individuals — infected and otherwise — out of contact with police, jail personnel and other defendants reduces the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission without creating a threat to public safety. Baltimore prosecutors also will continue not to seek cash bail. Defendants should remain incarcerated pretrial only if they pose a flight or public safety risk — not because they lack the funds to post bail. Since over half of the people in Maryland jails are simply waiting for their cases to be heard, this action could make a serious impact on our jail population. There are people who do need to remain in jail during this time. Practicing good hygiene and social distancing are important to ensure the safety of jail personnel and defendants. But in order to be effective, these measures need to happen alongside a significant reduction in the jail population. I hope other local officials take similar responsibility for reducing the risk of a coronavirus wildfire in our justice system. Police leadership and unions in Philadelphia and other cities have agreed to protect safety by issuing citations instead of arresting suspects for all but the most threatening cases. Judges in Oklahoma and Maine have vacated low-level warrants or placed them on hold. Boards of Correction are calling for the release of the elderly and medically frail. Jails in multiple states have released those nearing the end of their terms. Probation and parole officials are calling for a moratorium on sending people to prison for technical violations. Reducing the jail population, and new jail bookings in particular, is crucial to stopping the COVID-19 virus in Maryland. As someone who swore an oath to protect and serve, I believe it is the duty of law enforcement to take decisive action in times like these.

Amid blood shortage during coronavirus pandemic, UMMC to host blood drive with University of Maryland, Baltimore
.W
With the American Red Cross experiencing a blood shortage amid the coronavirus pandemic, the University of Maryland Medical Center is partnering with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, to host a three-day blood drive from March 25-27. According to the Red Cross, nearly 7,000 blood drives have been canceled across the country due to concerns about congregating during the COVID-19 outbreak. The drive will take place in the main lobby of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, SMC Campus Center. Interested donors can come on March 25 and March 26 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., as well as March 27, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Blood donors are asked to make an appointment on the American Red Cross website prior to coming to the drive so social distancing can be maintained throughout the event. Walk-ins will not be accepted. The Red Cross has implemented additional precautions, including a pre-donation donor temperature screening, enhanced disinfecting, social distancing and staff wellness and protection measures, to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

Olympic postponement: A sobering reminder the coronavirus threat isn’t going away quickly | COMMENTARY
.W
Historically, it takes a war to postpone or cancel the modern Olympic Games. Since 1896, there have been three cancellations — the 1916 Berlin games (World War I); and the 1940 and 1944 games (World War II) in Japan, then Helsinki, Finland, and, for the latter games, London and Italy. That’s a pretty high standard. There have been Olympics in some pretty bad times from the rise of Adolf Hitler’s Germany in 1936 to the post-Afghanistan invasion by the Soviet Union Olympics of 1980 which the United States and some of its western allies boycotted. Tuesday’s announcement by Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he and the International Olympic Committee came to an agreement to postpone the summer games to the summer of 2021 at the latest came as no big surprise under the circumstances. But it should serve as a reminder that the coronavirus outbreak will not be over in a matter of days or even weeks: The Olympics were not set to open in Tokyo until July 24. “The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present,” the parties announced in a joint statement. That is a lovely thought. And it certainly is not the first time that world leaders looked to the world’s largest sporting event to salve global wounds. Athletes like Reisterstown-native Olivia Gruver, a champion pole-vaulter, are likely disappointed. World-class skills can be a perishable commodity. But they, perhaps better than most, understand the limits of the human body and the risks conducting the games would have presented to everyone involved including their families. Meanwhile, Japan is looking at a major economic blow. The Olympics had been expected to bring more than 600,000 visitors to the island nation, and preparations already cost it more than $12 billion. President Donald Trump is already given to comparing the battle against COVID-19 as a military conflict positioning himself as a wartime president. In a sense, the delay of the Olympics supports that narrative. But the Olympics will rise again. Just as the U.S. and other nations will emerge from these days and weeks of quarantine. People will get back to work. Schools will eventually reopen. The economy will bounce back. But there’s a lesson in sports about health and injury. Athletes who have serious injury and try to get back in the game prematurely often cause a far worse outcome, turning a sprained knee, for example, into a candidate for surgery. Patience is as much a part of competition as motivation. Coaches often call this “playing smart.” Sometimes, you accept short-term setbacks in order to achieve long-term gain. Preventing hospitals and other medical providers from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 victims, that’s the goal here, that’s the finish line. The sacrifice has been significant but not yet to the point where it outweighs that higher purpose of saving lives. Here’s the best part of the Olympic postponement: It wasn’t about politics. Organizers simply recognized that this was not the time. The risks were not worth the reward. Reason won the day. We cheer for elected leaders who approach the outbreak in the manner of an athlete looking to win the gold: Pay no attention to the complainers, don’t get distracted by the unimportant, listen to expert coaching, focus on the goal at hand, recognize our limits and, of course, saying a little prayer never hurt.

‘It’s an unknown time': Baltimore bars and restaurants brace for decrease in business amid coronavirus concern
.W
Orto, a modern Italian bistro in Station North, is typically one of the city’s hot tickets, a haven for foodies to feast on burrata and homemade pastas. But owner Elan Kotz said he’s noticed an uptick in cancellations since the onset of COVID-19 concern. At a time when each news alert brings fresh terror — the stock market is down, travel from Europe has been banned, even Tom Hanks is sick — Baltimore’s bar and restaurant owners are taking steps to reassure customers and protect their employees. “It’s an unknown time,” Kotz said. “I’m definitely concerned about where this thing is headed.” Seeking to reassure customers, Kotz sent an email to guests outlining sanitizing measures restaurant staff are taking. “Every hour our staff will sanitize all surfaces, computers, doorknobs, and any items used to prepare food or cocktails,” he wrote. All staff will wash their hands every 30 minutes; hand sanitizer sits at each server station as well as the host stand. “The precautions are what are important,” said Kotz, who’s been conferring regularly with Orto customers who are high up officials at Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland. Other businesses are taking similar measures. Hampden’s Grano Pasta Bar has asked customers to pay with a credit card instead of cash, which can more easily spread germs. Graul’s Market, the grocery store chain with six locations in Maryland, informed customers Thursday that it was temporarily discontinuing its self service food sampling in stores. “We will continue to offer sampling served by our associates in a manner that is safe and wholesome,” according to an email the store sent out. The store said that it was focused on cleaning, with daily attention paid to “shopping carts, hand baskets, doors and handles, checkstands, all display cases, restrooms with proper disinfectants.” In addition, the stores will continue to offer disinfectant wipes to allow customers to sanitize carts and other surfaces. Others are taking more drastic measures. Flying Dog brewery posted on Instagram Wednesday that it would close its Frederick taproom and cancel all events at the facility indefinitely. ”The safety of our employees and community is our top priority and we will share additional updates as we are able," the Instagram post read. A spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. A statement on the brewery’s website noted that “brewery operations are not affected at this time." But it’s unclear whether the steps will be enough to keep people in shops. Foot traffic at Fells Point’s Broadway Market has gone down noticeably in recent days, said stall owner Sal Ayala of Sal & Sons, which sells fresh and prepared seafood. “We are concerned,” said Ayala. “We just hope they find a cure fast.” “The thing that worries me most is our staff,” said David Alima, co-owner of popular ice cream shop The Charmery, which has a stall coming to Federal Hill this spring and another shop scheduled to open in Columbia. He is concerned that a downturn in business will force him to cut hours for employees. At this point, Alima said, “So much is changing on a day to day basis. We’re trying not to be overly reactionary.” His stores are making sure they have to-go pints in stock for customers who prefer to eat at home or order it through UberEats. It’s not just food service companies that have been affected. A spokesperson for Wishbone Reserve, a trendy vintage shop on Falls Road in Hampden, wrote in an Instagram post that they had experienced a “drastic downturn of foot traffic in Baltimore city” in recent days. “We have bills to pay, children and animals to feed, mortgages and lives to to live. Your support keeps us afloat.”

MTA reopens Eastern bus division after shutting down for two days after driver tested positive for coronavirus 
.W
The Eastern bus division in Baltimore is reopening Friday, two days after a Maryland Transit Administration shut down the route when a bus driver tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The driver’s diagnosis was first disclosed to The Baltimore Sun on Tuesday by the president of the local union that represents drivers. The driver was not identified but Michael McMillan, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1300, said MTA Administrator Kevin Quinn told him the woman worked out of the Eastern Division, on Eastern Avenue. The route travels around the city and into the surrounding county. The Maryland Department of Transportation MTA said it’s reopening Friday after notification from local and state health officials, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, that it could resume regular operations. The agency said it was first notified about the bus driver’s positive COVID-19 test on Tuesday. The person was last said to be at work on March 19, MDOT MTA said. The Baltimore City Health Department and the Maryland Department of Health conducted an investigation and notified MDOT MTA that because the operator was not at work after the onset of their illness, the Eastern division could resume operations. McMillan was critical of the MTA on Tuesday, saying it was not doing enough to protect staff or riders during the COVID-19 outbreak. While the route was closed, the division underwent a “thorough cleaning and disinfecting,” MDOT MTA said, in addition to its regular daily disinfectant schedule. The routes affected by the temporary closure included: » CityLink Navy, Orange, Blue, Pink, Lime and Gold » LocalLink 21, 22, 28, 36, 56, 59, 62, 63, and 65 » Express BusLink 105, 120, and 160

With restaurants closed due to the coronavirus, Baltimore area chefs offer tips for home cooks
.W
Typically, Mario Cano Catalán spends his evenings cooking up elegant Argentine tapas and steaks at Bar Vasquez, the spacious Harbor East restaurant where he is executive chef. But with restaurants closed amid a deadly coronavirus pandemic, Cano Catalán, like the rest of us, is cooking more at home. One dish he often prepares for his children, ages 7 and 11, is scrambled eggs and broccoli. It’s a healthy, simple meal — good eating in stressful times. “It’s like Christmas for them,” Cano Catalán said, when asked how his kids are reacting to the extra time with their father. For the next few months, The Baltimore Sun will ask area chefs how to spice up at-home dining with simple-to-prepare dishes. In upcoming weeks, we’ll talk to Ekiben founder Steve Chu about how to prepare tofu to Foraged chef and owner about cooking with mushrooms. Is there something you want to know how to cook? Email ctkacik@baltsun.com. Mario Cano Catalán’s technique for cooking simple scrambled eggs and broccoli at home: Start by getting your pans hot on a low heat as you prep. To see whether the pan is sufficiently hot, observe how quickly a splash of olive oil runs to the sides of the pan. If it doesn’t move, it’s not hot enough, says Cano Catalán Eggs: Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk with a fork. When whisking, hold your fork sideways and move in a circular motion. This will create a more uniform flavor, color and texture. Pour into a hot pan coated with olive oil. Push from the sides of the pan using a wood or rubber spatula. For creamier eggs, cook about a minute and a half. Cook longer for dryer eggs. If you wish to add cheese or salt and pepper, toss in about halfway through the cook time. Broccoli: Break off medium-sized pieces of broccoli and drop in a bowl of water to rinse thoroughly. Toss in a saucepan and add olive oil and salt. Cover with a lid. If you don’t have a lid, that’s fine, but allow more time to cook. Let the broccoli cook 2-3 minutes, to the point that it’s softer but still a little crunchy. Use spatula or tongs to add to plate and serve.

Harford mosque that was closed due to coronavirus is opened to pray for community, workers on front lines of pandemic
.W
Harford County’s Masjid Al Falaah mosque has been closed for in-person worship since mid-March, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended people limit gatherings to 10 people to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. It was opened for a short while earlier this month though for a special call to prayer to honor the community and those who continue the fight against the pandemic. The Abingdon house of worship remains closed, even as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins Thursday. Muslims typically fast each day, breaking their fast with a festive evening meal, and spend the month reflecting on how they can improve themselves personally and spiritually. The faithful often gather to pray and break their fast. Masjid Al Falaah typically hosts a community iftar, or dinner to break the fast, during Ramadan each year so people can visit and learn about Islam. That is not expected this year as leaders of the congregation work to adhere to local, state and federal guidelines to keep gatherings small and maintain social distancing. The mosque was closed for worship even before Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a stay-at-home order March 30, according to Dr. Rehan Khan, president of the congregation. “There won’t be any congregational prayers at the physical mosque,” Khan said Wednesday. An exception was made April 10, however, as two members met in the mosque for the traditional Friday call to prayer. The pair prayed for “all the people in the area, the country, the state and the whole world” as COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, continues to spread around the globe, according to Khan. “We called on our creator, the King of the Day of Judgement, to have mercy on all humans,” Khan stated in a news release. “We are all children of Adam.” The worshippers took multiple safety precautions, such as wearing surgical masks and putting sheets of plastic over their prayer rugs. The plastic was disposed of after the prayers, Khan said Wednesday. “All the precautions were taken, and only two people are allowed” in the mosque, he said. The gathering, which Khan said was coordinated with the governor’s office, happened to fall on Good Friday, the day Christians commemorate the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ — his rise from the dead is celebrated on Easter Sunday. Khan acknowledged Wednesday the two Muslim worshippers’ “Christian brothers and sisters.” The call to prayer was a time to honor those who are on the front lines of the pandemic, such as health care workers, first responders, “everybody in the essential services going to work every day, putting their lives in danger to protect others," Khan said. He described the fight against COVID-19 as a “battle,” a battle in which “every person participates by following the guidelines to keep themselves safe and to keep others safe.” While Masjid Al Falaah is closed for worship, people are encouraged to pray at home. Anybody who has questions about upcoming events through the mosque, such as Ramadan, can send an email to alfalaah7@gmail.com.

Federal coronavirus relief program helps thousands of Maryland businesses but leaves others out as funds run dry
.W
Like many small business owners facing damaging losses, Drew Pumphrey jumped at the chance to apply for a forgivable loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program designed to offer relief from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The sole proprietor of the Smoking Swine food truck submitted “every application I could fill out,” he said, working with Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America and Kabbage, a small business lender. But a lack of guidance and no word from lenders has left him frustrated, especially now that the $349 billion program ran out of funds. “I know general accounting and how to make barbecue," said Pumphrey, who estimates he’s lost 90% of sales since his customers at office parks started working from home. "I don’t know how to apply for grants. I’m just trying to save my business here.” Matt Reade, the chief financial officer at the 300-employee, 50-year-old Bakery Express in Halethorpe, had a nearly opposite experience. A loan approved just days ago will allow him to continue paying an already reduced work force and could mean the difference between the commercial bakery staying open or closing for good. “It’s been a crucial lifeline for us to weather the storm and push through this period of low volume and short cash flow,” Reade said. Bakery Express was among thousands of Maryland small business helped by the program, part of the $2 trillion coronavirus aid package passed by Congress. But thousands others have found themselves cut off as funds ran dry. On Thursday morning, shortly after 11 a.m., the Small Business Administration stopped accepting applications from banks. Congress is considering a new appropriation, and banks say if that happens, they are prepared to quickly submit pending applications on a first-come, first-served basis. “We’ve never experienced such an unprecedented volume of assistance requests at one time,” said Rachel W. Howard, a spokeswoman and economic development specialist in the SBA’s Baltimore district office, in an email. “The existing infrastructure wasn’t built to handle this level of activity. SBA has worked around the clock to improve the processing software and to streamline the process.” Howard said the SBA expects to release lending statistics by state next week. M&T Bank said Friday that 96% of its eligible applicants were approved. In the Baltimore market, M&T funded 6,600 loans totaling more than $1.3 billion. It managed the huge volume of applications by assigning nearly 2,000 workers, front-line bankers, branch managers, back office staff and others across all of its markets, to work on processing loans, said Augie Chiasera, M&T’s regional president for Greater Baltimore. “We trained individuals very quickly in how to do the work, and they delivered in a big way,” Chiasera said. The bank also delayed opening its online portal for applications until April 6, rather than the day the federal program launched on April 3, to “make sure we would come out with an automated solution that would work, where clients could upload documents and data," Chiasera said. “Right now,” he said, “we’re in process of getting out notes and documents to clients so we can process the funds into their accounts.” Howard Bank, based in Baltimore, approved more than 700 loans, most that applied, totaling $180 million, said CEO Mary Ann Scully. Scully credits the bank’s high approval rate, in part, to its decision to use a manual rather than automated process to send loan documents from its customers to the SBA. The bank had 40 employees manually entering data into the SBA system. By doing so, the bank avoided slowdowns that some other lenders encountered in the automated system. “We didn’t have an automated front-end for the SBA,” Scully said. “Some that did have a front-end, their system crashed because of the volume. So ironically our decision to not try to deploy that ended up helping us.” It’s unclear how many loan applicants are caught in limbo — having applied to a lender but not in time for documents to be forwarded to the SBA before the portal closed. A survey of 21 community banks in Maryland found that 4,883 applications were pending or in process when the SBA closed the program to its authorized lenders. Those applications represent a combined $665 million in loans to businesses that employ 17,389 people, according to the survey by the Maryland Bankers Association. “Without further congressional funding, thousands of Maryland businesses and their employees are at risk of not being able to benefit from the much needed payroll relief," said Kathleen Murphy, the group’s president and CEO, in an announcement Friday. "Banks are anxiously waiting to upload thousands of pending applications once new funding is signed into law.” Members of Maryland’s congressional delegation also are among those calling for swift action, including including increased funding and legislative fixes to make the loans more flexible. “I hear daily from local businesses across Maryland about roadblocks to loans and delays in receiving funds," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, in a statement. On Friday, Annapolis-based Frost Law filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a jewelry designer and a financial services adviser against the SBA arguing that the Paycheck Protection Program was discriminatory — since a larger percentage of minority- and women-owned businesses make up the sole proprietor category. While the loan program opened to small businesses on April 3, sole proprietors, with no employees, were not eligible to apply until April 10. The later deadline for sole proprietors “essentially boxed out these businesses from even participating in the program,” said Matthew Kraeuter, partner of Frost Law. After the initial application deadline, “larger businesses flooded banks,” said Glen Frost, managing partner of Frost Law. Banks, in turn, prioritized larger clients, leaving less money available for mom-and-pop shops like his clients — Infinity Consulting Group LLC in Fort Washington, which does business as Glitz & Glam Jewelry by LJ, and Alvin Vaughn of Silver Spring. Pumphrey, whose food truck has been featured on the Food Network show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” was among those applying at the later date as a sole proprietor. Besides losing his office park business, he has had to delay the opening of a brick-and-mortar restaurant in Brooklyn. But even larger small businesses found themselves shut out. Tony Foreman helps run one of the largest restaurant groups in Baltimore. But so far, that hasn’t helped his Foreman Wolf group procure a loan through the program. The money would help rehire 250 employees laid off after the state ordered restaurants closed as gathering places to stem the spread of the pandemic. Foreman has yet to see any money. “I have to expect that nothing is going to come and hope that something is coming,” he said. In the meantime, he and remaining staff are preparing weekly grocery handouts for the company’s unemployed workers. Foreman said the company is also covering COBRA payments for laid-off workers to ensure they have health coverage.

Baltimore mayoral candidate Thiru Vignarajah unveils coronavirus recovery plan, calls for $250 million injection into local economy
.W
Mayoral candidate Thiru Vignarajah released Thursday his plan for helping Baltimore’s economy recover from the blow dealt by the coronavirus pandemic, calling for the city to dip deep into its rainy day fund and borrow against its bond rating. In a 35-page proposal dubbed “From Recovery to Prosperity,” Vignarajah lays out steps he says the city should take in the short and longterm to transform the public health crisis into an opportunity for growth. “The next mayor will need to fight a two-front war: one against entrenched economic inequities emboldened by a global pandemic, and another against the relentless violent crime that stunts our city’s capacity to reach its fullest potential,” Vignarajah, the former state deputy attorney general, wrote in a letter to city residents. “I am prepared for precisely that.” As mayoral candidates stare down the June 2 Democratic primary, they are seeking to make the argument that they’re best equipped to pull Baltimore out of a crisis. City Council President Brandon Scott also released a coronavirus recovery plan calling for Baltimore to use part of its rainy day fund, while Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young makes several pandemic-related announcements a week as he runs to hold onto his seat. Vignarajah called for the city to immediately stimulate the local economy by withdrawing $50 million from its rainy day fund and borrowing $200 million against the city’s AA bond rating. The money, he says, should be used to bolster sick-leave payments, support small businesses and expand internet access to help children who are supposed to be learning remotely but lack adequate technology to tune into online classes. Vignarajah proposes the city take advantage of emptier roads and school buildings to accelerate repairs and construction projects. Specifically, before kids return to schools, he called for City Hall to quickly install air-conditioning and heating systems into the dozens of buildings that still lack them. “We need to seize the opportunity that the near-term problems present,” he said. Economist Anirban Basu, of Sage Policy Group, said Vignarajah’s plan would move the city’s economic development forward “aggressively.” Some may question how practical it is to add additional debt to the city’s already fragile finances, he said, but nonetheless the plan represents a strong approach to recovery. “The economy will determine ultimately how quickly such a vision can be realized, but what Thiru Vignarajah has set forth is a great vision for Baltimore," Basu said. Basu has not endorsed any candidate for mayor, though he hosted a meet-and-greet with Vignarajah last year. Basu donated to Vignarajah’s unsuccessful 2018 campaign for state’s attorney but has not given to any mayoral campaign this cycle. City officials say they have to be “very judicious” in deciding to pull money from the rainy day fund, calling it a last resort. Budget director Bob Cenname said earlier this month that the city’s reserves — there’s about $145 million in the pot — help it maintain a strong credit rating. Vignarajah said their stance is “myopically conservative.” The bond rating is “not some trophy to be boasted about in the abstract,” he said. “This is an asset that Baltimore City has available to it. I don’t know what we’re waiting for if we’re not deploying that asset now.” Vignarajah’s plan lays out a multiyear approach to recovery. If elected, he says he will begin a process to cut property taxes in half over the next decade and relaunch the “dollar homes” program. Also running against Vignarajah are former Mayor Sheila Dixon, former police spokesman T.J. Smith and former U.S. Treasury official Mary Miller. Miller said the city’s recovery is going to demand more than what Vignarajah put out in his plan. “Digging our way out of the hole created by COVID-19 is going to take more than releasing long-winded documents with vague calls for action, bond sales and philanthropy,” she said in a statement. “Any effective plan needs to start now by tapping all the federal aid possible and creating direct programs to help Baltimoreans as quickly as possible.”

Maryland schools enter 'uncharted territory’ while planning for two-week shutdown for coronavirus
.W
Schools systems around the state were adjusting quickly to the new reality of a two-week school closing brought on by the global coronavirus pandemic. Baltimore City Public Schools will open 10 locations Monday for students to get meals. Baltimore County middle and high school students went home Friday with their laptops. And Anne Arundel County was gearing up to provide students with online classes while broadcasting lessons on TV channels. But despite the planning, some school systems are still struggling to get measures in place and the specter of a longer shutdown loomed in the back of many school leaders’ minds. Unlike a snow day, which brings a delightful break, teachers and administrators are worried that the health emergency would amplify the inequities for students without easy access to technology and food. “This is a time for focused, excellent execution. This is about flexible thinking and the ability to adjust,” said Baltimore schools CEO Sonja Santelises. City schools already had a plan in place for an emergency shutdown for the coronavirus, but everyone will need to make speedy adjustments when necessary, she said. School systems immediately focused on plans to provide food to students and to deliver some academic work. On Friday, plans for the delivery of meals to students who normally get them for free at school seemed a work in progress. While the city will have 10 sites up and running for grab-and-go breakfasts and lunches as early as Monday, advocates in Baltimore County were at first concerned the response was inadequate, and Harford County officials said they had not finalized plans. Anne Arundel has one of the most extensive plans. It will open 52 feeding centers offering free lunches each day, and will have mobile vans to distribute food. Some school systems, such as the Baltimore city and county, Anne Arundel, Carroll and Harford counties had packets of academic work ready to give students Friday or hand out or send out Monday, but in most cases, those assignments were not intended to be a substitute for actual lessons. “Our preliminary plans are very general just to keep kids working a little bit, but they aren’t really as focused as we would hope to keep kids moving forward in the curriculum,” said Harford Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson said. Many school systems planned to begin deep cleaning of schools and buses. Santelises said extra cleaning supplies ordered some time ago have begun arriving, and even the private taxis that transport a limited number of students would be sanitized. Because city schools were closed Friday for a day of teacher training, there wasn’t enough time to give out packets of work assignments. They will be available for pick up Monday at schools from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and also will be available online. Maryland State Superintendent Karen Salmon has suggested that school systems hold classes during the planned spring break, which for many students was scheduled for April 6-13. If that happens, students would lose only about four days of school, an interruption no greater than a long winter snow storm. However, there were hints that the closure could extend far longer. In a statement, Salmon said administrators, faculty, staff and parents should “begin to prepare for and implement measures for the continuity of educational services during a prolonged period.” Sending home a million school children will disrupt the lives of thousands of workers who must find child care or miss work to stay home. The state education department is developing plans to make sure children of emergency services personnel have access to childcare. How that will happen in the next three days is unclear, and Salmon declined to be interviewed. "We don’t know what the future will bring. We are out for two weeks. Is that the end of it or will it be longer?” said Baltimore County Superintendent Darryl Williams. Lots of questions remain to be answered, he said, about graduation or spring athletics or testing. “We don’t have those particulars. We are really taking it day by day.” The sudden school closings have brought out the best in the Baltimore city community, Santelises said. In the hours after the announcement she said she received phone calls and emails from every type of Baltimorean, from grandmothers who say they can take in a few kids to CEOs of major institutions offering support. “Yes, this is a challenge, but with everything Baltimore has been through, these are times when resiliency will come through...," she said. “It is heartening the number of people who care about kids in Baltimore City.” Some Baltimore County education advocates were concerned that children would go hungry after word went out Friday morning that only six high schools would serve lunches. Later in the day, however, the county schools expanded the number to 31 sites. “If this is the solution for the next two weeks, they are leaving children hungry,” said Yara Cheikh, the parent of four children. “The crisis is demonstrating the weaknesses of our infrastructure, feeding, transportation and access to the internet.” If schools remained closed for long, Santelises said, providing academic services to children will be more difficult. “As an equity issue, we have to make sure there are learning opportunities across the district no matter what their technological capacities,” she said. In Carroll County, school officials said they began working more than a week ago to prepare online materials alongside more traditional materials for students who have less access to the internet and communications devices. Cheryl Bost, the president of the Maryland State Education Association, the union representing the majority of the state’s teachers, said she’s concerned that children have their basic needs taken care of and are not left alone while parents work. She also hopes school districts will pay hourly workers if they aren’t on the job. “It is uncharted territory that we have never been in before,” said Bost, adding she wants to help people who could lose pay and potentially lose their houses. A prolonged closure, Bost said, would be “devastating” for the education of children, but she said teachers were growing concerned about the potential of being exposed to the virus in their classrooms. Children have shown to be less affected by the virus. Baltimore County’s Williams said he expects hourly workers may be helpful taking care of extra cleaning and food distribution. Late Friday, Cindy Sexton, president of the county teachers union, said the school officials had given hourly workers assurances they be paid through the two week shutdown.

Harford-area groups seeking volunteers to help make masks for health care workers during coronavirus pandemic
.W
As calls for masks for health care workers and others battling the coronavirus continue to grow, local people stuck in their homes have cranked up their sewing machines and started making the much-needed items. Social media is abuzz with a variety of information, patterns, instructional posts and videos on how to make and where to donate the masks. Anita Schatz of Kingsville operates the nonprofit organization Angel Gowns by Baba, which turns donated wedding dresses into gowns for stillborn babies, from the basement of her home. After seeing stories about people needing and making masks for a variety of health care services, Schatz has shifted gears and started making the masks with her group. “I personally know someone who died from the virus, that wasn’t what pushed me over the edge. Just seeing the need on television,” Schatz said as she organized a stack of fabric. “I pray about everything, I’m a Catholic, I pray to the Blessed Mother. I tell her to put things in front of me, you send me signs for whatever I need and it seems like that’s when I started finding the patterns and I thought we can do this.” After researching to find the pattern she thought would be the best, Schatz organized her volunteers and got down to business. The group usually meets in Schatz’s basement workshop but with the current social distancing rules, the group has had to adapt a bit. Volunteers are sewing or doing other tasks at their own homes and making quick stops by the Schatz home to drop off or pick up supplies, which are washed and sanitized. Volunteer Patty Miller, who has taken on the task of washing the newly purchased or donated fabric for the masks, made a quick exchange of some freshly washed rolls of fabric for the next pile of fabric ready to be laundered. “I have hand sanitzer, I have gloves if they feel better wearing them. I have alcohol in a spray bottle so I’m constantly spraying things down as they come in," Schatz said. The rest of the Schatz family has also gotten involved with son Joe Schatz, who lives close by, and his family helping to cut the cloth into pieces to be sewn together and other tasks. While Anita Schatz has a small army of volunteers that she is organizing to help, extra hands are always welcome and donations, both materials and money are always appreciated. To lend a hand you can go to Angel Gowns by Baba on Facebook, email agbbinc@gmail.com or call 410-817-4659. Schatz and her fellow volunteers are not the only local people taking this need into their own hands. Countless individuals in Harford County and the surrounding areas like Debbie Phelan of Havre de Grace have jumped onboard and groups like Making Masks for Maryland started by Jenny Krista of Belcamp offer information for those looking to get involved. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that homemade masks are not considered personal protective equipment, but in settings where facemasks are not available, health care providers may use homemade masks, bandanas or scarves as a last resort when caring for COVID-19 patients. The University of Maryland Medical System, which operates Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air and Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace, lists information on its website at umms.org/masks, about how to make masks appropriate for use in their medical facilities. For the moment, Upper Chesapeake Health isn’t experiencing the shortages of personal protective equipment as other places in the country, said Martha Mallonee, a spokesperson for the health system. The medical system is accepting cloth masks and some have already been dropped off, she said, noting the CDC’s recent guidance on the use of cloth masks in certain settings. Donated masks need to undergo inspection and a distribution process needs to be developed before they can be used, she said. “We will consider these masks as an option when we get to a shortage of standard personal protection equipment,” Mallonee wrote in an email. “It has been heartening to live and work in a community that cares about their hospital teams during this difficult time.”

Towson University asks 9 students, one staff member to self-quarantine after potential coronavirus exposure
.W
Towson University is asking nine students and one staff member who attended a conference in Washington, D.C., to self-quarantine at home because of coronavirus concerns. The university also asked these people to stay away from campus for two weeks from their last date of attendance to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, held March 1-3. There have been at least two reports of COVID-19 cases from that conference. AIPAC is a lobbying group that advocates pro-Israel policies. In an email from campus spokesman Sean Welsh, the university said it was made aware over the weekend of the students and staff member who attended the conference. According to a Monday morning email from the chair of the university’s mass communication department that was obtained by Baltimore Sun Media, at least one student who attended the conference is in self-quarantine “out of an abundance of caution” but is not currently displaying symptoms. The student attended some classes last week and the classrooms where that student was “are being wiped clean with disinfectants today,” said the email, which was addressed to department faculty. Faculty of these classes were given the choice to convert their classes to an online format, the email said.

Four more Pleasant View Nursing Home residents succumb to coronavirus, seven new community cases in Carroll County
.W
Four more residents of the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy have died from complications of the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, the Carroll County Health Department announced Monday. The deceased are two women in their 60s, a woman in her 70s, and a woman in her 80s. All resident test results have been reported for Pleasant View Nursing Home and 79 of the 95 residents tested positive. Fourteen have now died. Four additional Pleasant View staff had tested positive as of Monday, bringing the total to 31. Not all staff of Pleasant View reside in Carroll County and are not included in the total number of cases for Carroll. Outside of nursing home facilities, seven more Carroll County residents tested positive, the Health Department announced Monday. They were two women in their 20s, a woman in her 30s, a woman in her 50s, two men in their 50s and one woman in her 60s. In total, Carroll has seen 148 residents test positive, and 12 have been released from isolation after being deemed recovered. The Carroll County Health Department reported no additional COVID-19 cases from the residents or staff at Carroll Lutheran Village. The retirement community in Westminster has so far seen 12 positive tests among residents and two among staffers. One woman, a resident in her 90s, has died, the Health Department said Saturday. “The Carroll County Health Department will continue to work with the county’s long-term care facilities to increase their preparedness and response capacities for COVID-19, including the adoption of a series of enhanced protective measures as by defined Gov. Hogan’s executive order and directed by Maryland Department of Health Secretary Robert R. Neall,” the Health Department said in a news release. Anyone feeling ill should contact their health care professional. Carroll County Health Department is operating a COVID-19 hotline, available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week, at 410-876-4848. After hours, callers may leave a message or call 211. Those with emergencies should continue to call 911. Updates on the number of Maryland cases and other important information can be found on the health department’s COVID-19 webpage at cchd.maryland.gov/covid-19/.

MIAA, IAAM cancel high school spring sports seasons due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
The spring seasons of both the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association and Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland have been canceled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The organizations, which supervise private school athletic competition in the area, are the first high school sports associations in Maryland to cancel their spring seasons. Both leagues had postponed their seasons twice. The Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association’s spring season remains postponed. “The MIAA and IAAM would like to provide an update following Governor Larry Hogan and State Superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon’s press conference on Friday, April 17, 2020 extending the on-site closure of Maryland schools through May 15, 2020," the MIAA and IAAM said in a statement. “In light of this announcement, the MIAA and IAAM have made the formal decision to cancel the remainder of the 2020 spring sports season. In addition, there will be no league supported playoffs or championships.” Most teams had only played a handful of games before the seasons were halted in mid-March. The MIAA season started March 3, and all games were postponed by March 16. Hogan and Salmon announced at a press conference Friday that public school closures would extend through May 15, further diminishing any hope of a sports season for state athletic associations. It was that act, St. Mary’s athletic director Allison Fondale said, that motivated the committee of athletic directors, heads of schools and board of directors to cancel the season. The MIAA and IAAM had projected a five-day practice window and a handful of games in May, but only if schools were open and operational and authorities deemed it safe to hold sporting events. Of the 29 schools that comprise the MIAA and the 31 of the IAAM, several schools, such as Saints Peter & Paul in Easton, had already chosen not to take part in a shortened season. Tuesday’s ruling means no chance for Gerstell to defend its MIAA B Conference title, but coach Cap Poklemba said he assumed a decision was coming soon. Poklemba said the Falcons were preparing for this during a recent Zoom meeting. “It’s unfortunate,” he said. “We’ve just got to make the best out of whenever we do get back. Hopefully we do get back into school. ... I don’t see us getting back into classes, but hopefully we can get back to the point where we might be able to get to graduation and get these seniors at least a decent send-off.” The blow will likely be felt more deeply by some teams that will be graduating a big portion of their rosters. St. Mary’s boys lacrosse lists 15 seniors, all of whom unwittingly played their final game on March 6 against Georgetown Prep. Poklemba had only two seniors on his baseball roster for this spring in Chris Hagan and Logan Satti, and the Falcons were coming off a 17-7 season that saw them win six of their final seven games and defeat Boys’ Latin twice in two days to win the B Conference title. “That’s a pretty good memory to be able to walk away with,” Polkemba said. “If you’ve got to think positively about it, a good way to go out is with a championship.” Annapolis Area Christian School’s girls lacrosse team had been one of those programs fortunate to play one game. As news of the cancellation hit coach Deanna Thorpe, she had been sorting through team photos for an Instagram tribute to seniors. The next time she’ll look upon the faces of her players will be in a Zoom meeting, where they will all — Thorpe included — laugh and cry and do whatever they need to do to work through the news. The lesson Thorpe aims to instill is to control only what they can control. Five of her seniors were starters this spring, and none will continue lacrosse in college. Thorpe had multiple juniors hoping to attract college coaches’ attentions this spring. “The good news is that we’re all in the same storm. The bad news is that everybody’s ship might look a little different,” Thorpe said. “Hopefully, you can keep your ship afloat.” The Calvert Hall lacrosse team opened the season as the country’s No. 1-ranked team and improved to 3-0 with an 18-3 win over Florida-based IMG Academy on March 10. For the three-time defending MIAA A Conference champions, Tuesday’s news they would not get a chance to make it four straight was disheartening. Coach Bryan Kelly planned to have a Zoom call with his players Tuesday night. "I know the kids are really disappointed,” he said. “Obviously, they’ve put a lot of time, energy and work into the season and this ends careers for a lot of incredible lacrosse players throughout the state. It’s just not the way you want to finish your senior year of high school.” Carroll County Times sports editor Pat Stoetzer contributed to this story.

Baltimore woman in her 20s is second confirmed case of coronavirus in the city, Mayor Young says
.W
A Baltimore woman in her 20s is the city’s second confirmed case of the new coronavirus, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced Monday. Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said her agency is investigating the case, and pleaded with residents to take steps to protect themselves and others. “Everyone in Baltimore City has to take seriously the need to practice social distancing, in additional to increased hand washing,” Young said in a statement. “This virus is not a joke and the quicker we have maximum participation from our residents, the better for everyone. We will continue to take aggressive measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, but we need the public’s help.” Baltimore officials have asked residents to practice “social distancing” to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 illness in the city. People are advised to avoid crowds and stay home if sick. The city’s first case was announced Saturday and involved a man in his 60s. As with this latest announcement, few details were provided, including where in the city the patient lives, how they contracted the illness or what kind of treatment they’re receiving. Maryland has more than 30 confirmed cases. Cities across the state on Monday prepared to take drastic measures to attempt to limit the spread of the virus, after Gov. Larry Hogan announced plans to shut down all bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms. The mass closures go into effect at 5 p.m. Monday. Grocery stores, banks, pharmacies and other essential services will remain open. “We should continue to expect the number of cases to dramatically and rapidly rise,” Hogan said during a news conference. “This is going to be much harder, take much longer and be much worse than almost anyone is currently understanding."

Harford resource officers still working to support students while schools are closed during coronavirus pandemic
.W
For officer first class Jason Neidig, the most difficult part about not going to work at Aberdeen Middle School is that he cannot see the students’ faces. But he and other school resource officers throughout Harford County are not letting school closures stop them from engaging with kids and supporting them when needed. Neidig, who has been an SRO at Aberdeen Middle School for four years, said he saw students frequently using social media applications like Instagram, Youtube and TikTok, so he met students where they were — creating accounts on the platforms. He saw in them a way to stay engaged with students who are home from school and offer messages of encouragement. Neidig encourages the students to do their homework and keep up with their studies and promote positivity while they are at home during the school closures to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Maryland’s public schools have been closed statewide since March 16 and will continue to be closed through at least next week. Though in-person interaction has been largely prohibited by Gov. Larry Hogan’s executive orders, Neidig can still engage students through the internet — talking with students and hosting a TikTok challenge where students lip-sync songs and are judged by his two young daughters. Those simple acts, he said, can be the mentorship students need to thrive. “I wanted to build that relationship with the students not just only in the school but outside the school,” Neidig said. "They have got to believe in themselves.” A resident of Aberdeen and parent to children attending the city’s schools, Neidig tries to build a respectful, supportive relationship with students, which can be a difficult task in some schools, given some impressions of police officers. Some students assume SROs are watching and waiting to get them in trouble. "When I first started out it was an ‘oh he is a cop’ kind of thing,” Neidig said. Now, he said, students wave to him if he cruises by their homes while on patrol. In lieu of his duties at schools, he is helping the Aberdeen Police Department’s telephone reporting unit answer calls that do not require immediate intervention and patrolling the streets. He sees them sometimes while out and stops to talk — from inside the cruiser and a safe distance away, of course — to let them know he is there for them, even while school is out. And Neidig is not the only SRO to have students’ backs. Other officers in the county miss the interaction they have with students. Nick Rhodes, an SRO for the Bel Air Police Department primarily working at Bel Air Middle School, said he misses the students’ positivity and the connection they share. Like many SROs, he refers to the students as “his students." He has seen the kids while out on patrol, which he has been doing more of recently, and has let them know that he wants to stay connected and there for them if they need support. “I always tell them hey if you or anybody you know is having a rough time ... reach out,” Rhodes said. "A lot of them I know on a first-name basis.” SROs wear many different hats in the course of their jobs, Rhodes said. They have to act as friends, brothers, parents and authorities for students when needed, That requires some mental gymnastics to switch between all the roles officers need to fill in schools. "We have to learn how to be all these types of people but still be a police officer,” he said. SROs at the Harford County Sheriff’s Office Brian Brandow and Khalid Mitchell said they have also let students know that, though schools may be closed, they are willing to help off of school grounds. Students dealing with issues can contact them, just as students without issues are welcome to. Mitchell, who has over a decade of experience as an SRO, said that three have contacted him so far — one just to say hi. “We play a huge counseling role for these kids,” Mitchell said. “You grow attached to them.” This is Brandow’s first year as an SRO, but he worked in the office’s patrol division for 14 years. The experience is different, he said, but mutually rewarding and impactful for both officers and students. "The big, important thing for me was the positive interaction I have with the kids,” Brandow said. “It was just an eye opener, being in the school and having this positive interaction.”

‘Just trying to breathe’: Baltimore couple describe fighting coronavirus at home, and why they fear for others
.W
Between his long hours sleeping and her fitful searches for answers online, his forcing down meals he couldn’t taste and her cleaning, cooking and caring for him as best she could, there was the constant, unrelenting worry — gnawing at them for days as they hunkered down in their Baltimore apartment, waiting for his breathing to falter. “There was about 72 hours there that were really scary, because we couldn’t tell which way this was going, and I didn’t know what to do,” said Fagan Harris, a local nonprofit leader who tested positive for the novel coronavirus last month. “I’m just trying to breathe,” he would tell his partner and caregiver, Meryam Bouadjemi, when she found him staring blankly at the wall one day. “I’m trying to assess whether this is getting worse, and we need to go to the hospital.” For many people across the city and world, the coronavirus fight is just so: a homebound existence where there’s little to do but lay in wait, hoping it is you who defeats the virus and not the other way around. With a health care system in stress, patients like Harris, 33, are being sent home, or told to stay there, despite high fever, chills, a vicious cough and a shortness of breath just one step from alarming. The virus saps your strength but is considered manageable — until it isn’t. “That’s the test," Harris was told by a trusted doctor friend. “If you can breathe.” Spending days on edge about such a critical human function was perhaps the worst part of the entire episode, said Harris, who is now in recovery. But more broadly, the experience was defined, for both him and Bouadjemi, by the complicated logistics of being under quarantine and a deeply confusing experience with the health care system, they said — one that left them increasingly concerned for others who lack the resources, health coverage and support networks that they relied on heavily. “Our success engaging the conventional health care system was limited, and instead, our most helpful guidance came from our social network," Harris said. It’s an observation that has helped shape Harris’ plans moving forward, on the other side of his illness, as one of the more than 10,000 people in the United States and 240,000 globally who have recovered from the virus and may have some resistance to it. By fluke or fate, Bouadjemi, 31, thinks she is in that cohort, too, though she lacks a diagnosis and never had intense symptoms. And she also wants to help, once their quarantine lifts. Neither knows for sure how they ended up sick, but they have their suspicions. For Harris, the president and CEO of Baltimore Corps — which works to bring talented people into public service roles in the city — it began with a runny nose and what he thought was a cold March 7, four days after he’d had jury duty in a room with some ill-seeming fellow jurors, he said. By March 10, when his office had already moved to remote work, he began having “full-blown flu-like symptoms,” including “a lot of chills, fever, sweating while you’re sleeping,” he said. “I thought there was something wrong with my mattress my body ached so much.” Bouadjemi, pursuing a graduate degree in entertainment production at the University of Southern California, had by then already been sick on the other side of the country, after coming into contact with a professor she believes was also ill. Bouadjemi had a “low-grade fever and tiredness,” and an 18-hour migraine, she said, but the worst of it lifted after a day or two. She had self-isolated for more than two weeks. And then, after her university moved its courses online, she decided to come back to Baltimore, wrapping herself up in a homemade “hazmat suit” for the journey, she said. When she arrived to her and Harris’ apartment in Mount Vernon on March 13, he was already in the throes of illness. And though she didn’t have a diagnosis for her own sickness, she felt she’d likely already had the virus, and dedicated herself to caring for him. “I kind of risked being in this small space with Fagan for the entirety because I assumed I had immunity,” she said. “I felt really grateful that I was in a position that I could be caring for him.” As the days passed, Harris — who has exercise-induced asthma but hadn’t needed an inhaler for years — got worse, and “the lung symptoms really started to escalate.” On the morning of March 19, he knew something had to give. “I woke up, I looked at Meryam and said, ‘I have to go to the hospital. I can’t walk to the bathroom without feeling like I’m going to pass out from not being able to breathe.'” The next few days were a confusing blur of conflicting medical advice from his primary care provider at Chase Brexton and staff at the University of Maryland Medical Center, where he was referred for a chest X-ray. At first, he was put on an antibiotic for pneumonia, but came off it days later when his coronavirus test came back positive, he said. Hospital officials told him he didn’t need an X-ray, despite his doctor’s earlier recommendation. And though he was told to head home and wait it out there, the directives didn’t come with much advice for how best to do so, he said. Both UMMC and Chase Brexton declined to comment on a specific patient’s experience. The couple began reaching out to family and friends in the medical field, unsure how best to address Harris’ symptoms while in quarantine. Bouadjemi contacted her cousin, a nurse practitioner. Harris, who is a trustee at Johns Hopkins Bayview Hospital, reached out to Dr. Richard Bennett, the hospital’s president — who said Harris was one of four friends and colleagues with the coronavirus whose progress he was tracking in recent weeks. They asked about the prescription medicines Harris was on, the frequency with which he should use the inhaler and cough suppressant he was given, and the best foods for him to eat to power through the fight. In addition to the medical advice, Harris and Bouadjemi relied on friends and family in Baltimore and the surrounding region to help them in other ways, including bringing them groceries, medicine and a thermometer, since they couldn’t leave their apartment. The support “absolutely proved critical in my recovery,” Harris said. As he continues to feel stronger, he and Bouadjemi said they now fear for others who may not have as many resources at their disposal, and urged anyone in a position to help others through such an experience to do so. “Institutions and networks of people with access to expertise, knowledge, and insight should make every effort to be available to as many people as possible so folks can benefit from a responsible baseline of knowledge and support,” Harris said. “Without it, I fear individual judgments, or actual miscalculations in judgments, could lead to unnecessary tragic results.” Harris said Baltimore Corps has already “shifted our entire human capital” toward responding to the pandemic, and is working to fill a range of related positions in the city — from nurses to social workers to food delivery workers. Once he’s out of quarantine, he said, he plans to use his experience — and whatever resistance to the virus he may enjoy — to be out on the front lines, helping others as he was helped. “We all have this understandable fear of COVID, but I feel like I can’t be afraid, I have to just fight through and be out there to help people, because a lot of people need help," he said. “This is a time when we all have to come together to do that.”

Maryland tests three new patients for possible cases of coronavirus; Gov. Hogan says he’ll request $10M for preparedness
.W
Three more Marylanders are being tested for the coronavirus that has sickened more than 80,000 people globally, state officials confirmed this week. Officials expect results in the next two or three days from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where the samples were sent. The state lab does not yet have the ability to test more quickly here, but officials say they might gain kits and approvals as early as next week. The criteria for testing generally have included travel to infected countries or close contact with an infected person. Two others in the state have tested negative since the outbreak of the virus, called COVID-19, began earlier this year. "I want to assure Marylanders that the state is taking every precaution when it comes to coronavirus,” Gov. Larry Hogan said during a news conference at the state’s emergency operations center in Reisterstown on Thursday. “Our highest priority is to keep citizens safe.” Hogan outlined the state’s preparedness during the conference, which followed a cabinet meeting on the virus. He also said he’d be submitting a supplemental budget request for $10 million for the effort. The governor said he’d be briefing other state leaders tomorrow and continues to be in contact with federal health authorities and Vice President Mike Pence, whom President Donald Trump put in charge of the nation’s coronavirus response Wednesday. For now, Hogan said, the risk remains low. He asked Marylanders not to panic but to be prepared for more infections, school closures and event cancellations and to work from home as conditions change. This echoes advice CDC officials gave to all Americans on Tuesday. Officials said they expected more cases in the United States, though a day later Trump sought to downplay the threat somewhat. The CDC said there are 60 cases of the coronavirus in several states across the country, including one person in California who did not travel or knowingly come in contact with someone infected. That is what’s known as community spread and is concerning to public health officials. The uncertainty from the virus has caused the stock market to drop more than 10 percent this week. It’s also caused a run on supplies such as face masks, alarming public health officials who fear needed supplies will be limited for hospitals and other medical providers. Authorities also say the masks are unlikely to provide much protection. Their main benefit is to keep infected people from passing the virus to others. About 80 percent of people infected with the virus around the world have had mild respiratory symptoms. Among those who become far sicker about 2% to 4% have died. Most of the fatalities have been older people. Efforts to create a vaccine are underway but not expected to be available until at least next year. A therapy may be available sooner, federal authorities have said. Lawmakers in Washington are seeking more funding than the $2.5 billion sought by Trump to prepare, a move he said he would not oppose. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat and member of the House Appropriations Committee, said Thursday that he is calling for $4 billion or more to be used exclusively for coronavirus and fighting infectious disease. That includes development of a vaccine, interest-free loans for small businesses affected by an outbreak, and reimbursement to state and local governments for their spending on an outbreak. “We need to make sure our public health experts and medical professionals are informing and planning our country’s response to the coronavirus outbreak — not politicians,” Ruppersberger said in a statement. “Historically, our country has come together not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans, to address pandemics like this. This is no time for the chest-thumping and finger-pointing we have seen in recent days.” Specifically regarding the small businesses, Maryland Democrat Sen. Ben Cardin and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio sent a letter to Jovita Carranza, administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, requesting information about how the agency intends to administer aid. The senators, the chair and ranking member on the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, said 30 million small businesses could potentially be disrupted by the virus. “As the situation continues to evolve, it is becoming clear that the threat of widespread transmission of COVID-19 could have severe economic impacts on small businesses and the U.S. economy as a whole,” the senators wrote. “For this reason, we urge you to take immediate action to ensure that small businesses and their employees are equipped to prepare for, and respond to, the anticipated spread of COVID-19 in order to reduce both short-term and long-term disruptions.” Back in Maryland, state leaders from agencies focused on health, education, emergency management, transportation, aging, budget and law enforcement have been meeting regularly to formulate plans in case the conditions worsen in the state. They are coordinating with local health departments, hospitals and schools, which have their own plans. Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for public health services, said the coordination will continue. She also said residents of the state should take the same precautions they take to ward off the flu virus that is currently circulating. The flu virus has led to 3,000 hospitalizations and 40 deaths in the state. Those precautions include frequent hand washing, coughing into a tissue and staying home when sick. Also on Thursday, the Port of Baltimore said authorities have implemented procedures to ensure that crew members have not been sick in the past two weeks. Cruise ship companies have instituted screening measures for passengers and won’t allow anyone onto the ships who have visited areas affected by the coronavirus or come into contact with others who have been to those areas in the past two weeks. At the University of Maryland, a study-abroad program in South Korea has been suspended and students have been told to return home, reflecting recent changes in the CDC guidance. Study-abroad programs in China already had been canceled. The university has told students in Japan and Italy to be prepared to leave if the coronavirus becomes more prevalent in those countries. It also advised students on other study-abroad programs to limit their travel. Baltimore Sun reporters Liz Bowie and Lillian Reed contributed to this article.

West Carroll: Family-owned businesses, trying to cope amid coronavirus crisis, deserve support
.W
Friday the 13th 2020: a day that changed the lives and lifestyles of so many here in Carroll County with the introduction of the COVID-19 disease that a coronavirus brought to the community. Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency on March 6 and expanded the parameters of that emergency on March 12 with the closing of all public schools. Later, the governor expanded the scope of the emergency to include closing all restaurants and bars. Restaurants can provide carryout, curbside and delivery only. Many family-owned restaurants in West Carroll have indicated they will offer carryout and curbside services only (no dine-in for those set up for that). Here are some of them. Bess and Ben’s Country Kitchen Restaurant in Taneytown will offer, in addition to regular menu items, “take and bake” and precooked meals. They have implemented a delivery service within a 10-mile radius of their restaurant. They also are providing carryout and curbside pickup. Check their Facebook page for details: www.facebook.com/CountryKitchenTaneytown. Orders may be placed by phone at 410-756-2088.  Uncle Matty’s Eatery in New Windsor will be open for carryout only. For more information and hours of operation, check out their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/unclemattyseatery or call 410-635-6777 for more information.   Tony’s Café and Pizzeria in Taneytown will offer carryout and delivery. For updated information, check out their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/TonysCafeAndPizzeria or call them at 410-756-4050.  Original Pizza in Union Bridge will be open for curbside delivery or pickup at the front entrance. They will only be able to take orders and payment over the phone. When your order is ready, you will receive a call/text to confirm. For more information, check them out on Facebook at www.facebook.com/Originals86.  The Buttersburg Inn will offer curbside delivery. Hours are currently 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Breakfast orders will be taken until noon. Check out their specials and menu on their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/buttersburginn.net.  Thunderhead Bowl and Grill has posted on their website that bowling has been suspended until further notice. Leagues have been postponed through at least March 30. The Grill will have food and beverages available for carryout only from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. For more information check out their website at thunderheadbowling.com. As COVID-19 changes the landscape of our lives on an almost daily basis it is important to try to patronize the family-owned restaurant of your choice whenever you can. They are small businesses who depend on you to keep them going now more than ever. Other local businesses have also had to change the way they handle day-to-day operations, working diligently to remain open during the COVID-19 crisis. Local Homestead Products in New Windsor, owned by Trevor and Victoria Hoff, have kept their customer base updated on the daily changes on their Facebook page, at www.facebook.com/localhomestead. The Hoffs’ farm focuses on produce (greenhouse and field production) and meats (beef, pork, chicken). They continue to provide products from area producers including Starry Night Bakery in Westminster (muffins, coffee cakes, cookies and cupcakes), Stone Harth Bakery out of Frederick (artisan breads), Whispering Breeze Farm in Taneytown (variety of cheeses), and South Mountain Creamery in Frederick (glass bottled milk, ice cream, butter and more). Hoff said, “There are a lot of key players that stock our store, keeping high-quality products in every area.” Hoff indicated that, as a small producer, they are very much aware of how their food safety practices impact the customer. “We have implemented extra safety measures and have had positive feedback from our customers. "There is such a high demand for our product that we are adding special hours to our market for convenient [customer] shopping,” Hoff said. Check out their Facebook page to keep up with their product availability and current hours of operation. Gabrielle Schoeffield covers Taneytown, Union Bridge, New Windsor and surrounding areas.

As coronavirus spreads in Maryland prisons, a small team of inmates makes 24,000 masks, other protective gear 
.W
Typically, the incarcerated men and women who work inside Maryland’s prisons build furniture, sew bedsheets and make American flags. But last month ― when the first cases of the novel coronavirus were detected in the state ― they pivoted to a new operation: protecting their fellow Marylanders. “We thought, ‘How could we produce things to help in the crisis?’” said Robert L. Green, the secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. “We started looking at the cloth sneeze guards. We’ve had sewing factories for years in our system. This was an area where we could repurpose those to help." To date, about 75 inmates have made more than 24,000 cloth masks, 18,000 plastic face shields, 4,000 bottles of hand sanitizer and 1,900 protective gowns ― all items that have been in short supply and are needed to slow the spread of the pandemic. The inmates ― who volunteer for the jobs and receive “good time” credits that accrue toward their early release and a small amount of hourly pay ― have produced enough masks and face shields to outfit each of the more than 4,000 correctional officers in the system. Additional supplies are going to protect the inmates themselves from the spread of the disease, and then inmate-produced gear will go to other state agencies, Green said. Even Gov. Larry Hogan has worn a black mask made by the inmates. “The mask that I was wearing was made by prisoners at the Maryland correctional facility,” the Republican governor said as he recently toured a field hospital being set up at the Baltimore Convention Center. “They’re very happy to be doing this and be part of the solution. They’re excited to be in some way helping their fellow Marylanders.” While state officials tout the operation, prisoner rights advocates argue the program exploits prison labor and the workers should be paid much more than the low wages allowed under Maryland law. Julie Magers, who leads the Maryland Prisoners’ Rights Coalition, says the inmates are providing a critical function during the pandemic. “The amount of pay is completely inadequate for what they’re doing," she said. Prison officials did not provide details about how much the inmates were being paid, but said they were receiving a type of emergency bonus pay. Maryland Correctional Enterprises typically pays its inmate workers between 17 cents to $1.16 an hour, state records show. The operation run by Maryland Correctional Enterprises comes while the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread behind bars. More than 150 people who work or live in Maryland’s prisons have been infected with COVID-19, including 39 inmates. Outbreaks have been detected at 11 institutions. One prisoner, a man in his 60s, died from the disease. The prisons involved in the manufacturing include the Eastern Correctional Institution in Westover on the Eastern Shore, the Maryland Correctional Training Center in Hagerstown, and both the Maryland Correctional Institution and the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women in Jessup. Green said the inmates in the program wear protective gear while working and follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control social distancing guidelines. His office supplied photos of workers wearing full-body protective suits. “The inmate population that works in these programs, in a human crisis, they are pleased and proud of the opportunity they have to lend a hand to the community and try to make a difference,” Green said. Prison officials also declined to allow The Baltimore Sun to interview inmates involved in the work. Officials did allow a few inmate workers to record video statements to send to The Sun about the jobs they’re doing. “It’s an honor,” one worker said in a video. “On behalf of the men here at MCE, we’re honored to be able to participate in this endeavor to help with the greater good of society. We not only want to leave here and be productive members of society, but we’re starting in here by being productive.” State Sen. James Rosapepe, a Democrat who represents Anne Arundel and Prince George’s counties, said he thought it was “terrific” news that the protective gear made by inmate workers was going out to both prison staff and the incarcerated. “Prisons are like colleges and nursing homes,” Rosapepe said. “They’re in very close quarters. Folks who are institutionalized are at particular risk. I’m glad they’re starting to protect the prisoners, as well as the staff.” Even so, Rosapepe said, he’s heard concerns from union officials who represent correctional officers that the masks produced by the Maryland Correctional Enterprises are not the N95 respirator masks used in health care settings. Patrick Moran, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland Council 3 union, said union leaders had to push the state for weeks to equip correctional officers. “They finally made the face masks mandatory, after we kept on pushing them for a month,” Moran said. “The officers have face masks; they have face shields; they have gloves and sanitizer. But they’re not proper [protective gear]. They’re not the proper N95 masks. The masks are fine if you’re walking out on a street. It’s not fine in a prison." Magers said she’s not surprised that the inmates involved in the operation take pride in their work. “They’re proud to do good work, of course," Magers said. “I’m sure they’re very happy to be helpful. Most of them are happy to get out of their cell." But she said incarcerated individuals should be outfitted with the same protective gear that officers have. "They’re making all these masks. When are they going to see protective PPE?” Magers asked. Under pressure from advocates, prison officials in recent weeks have taken steps to try to reduce the population of correctional facilities to help slow the spread of the virus. Hogan signed an executive order last week to expedite the release of hundreds of inmates. The order speeds up the release of inmates who were already eligible to be released within the next four months and the processing of inmates eligible for home detention. The order also directs the Maryland Parole Commission to accelerate consideration of parole for inmates convicted of nonviolent crimes who are older than 60, have a good record while incarcerated, and have an approved plan for reentry to society. State officials estimate the executive order will result in the early release of about 800 additional inmates. About 18,400 people are in state correctional custody. Since March, the population of people incarcerated at state-run prisons and jails has declined by about 650. Magers said the only way to ensure prisons remain safe from the virus is to continue to lower the number of inmates. She said the health care system behind bars is “kind of a mess.” “They need to de-carcerate as much as possible,” Magers said. “De-carceration is the only way to really fix the problem.”

Baltimore County man in his 60s is Maryland’s second coronavirus death as officials confirm 42 new cases
.W
A second Maryland resident who tested positive for coronavirus has died, Gov. Larry Hogan reported Friday night. The victim was a Baltimore County man in his 60s with underlying medical conditions, the governor said. Neither the man’s identity nor his area of residence in the county was disclosed. “On behalf of our entire state, we send our heartfelt condolences to his family and to all those who loved him,” Hogan said in a statement. It was the state’s second death from the virus in three days. On Wednesday night, Hogan reported the state’s first death in the pandemic, a man in his 60s from Prince George’s County. Officials said the man had acquired the disease through spread within the community, not from travel. He, too, had underlying health problems, officials said. Maryland officials confirmed 42 new cases of the coronavirus Friday, bringing the state’s count to at least 149. The new cases include two more children, an infant and teenager who tested positive, tweeted Mike Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, who did not specify their ages. A case involving a 5-year-old Howard County girl was confirmed Thursday. None of the children was hospitalized, Ricci said. Also Friday, the Naval Academy in Annapolis and T. Rowe Price Group confirmed they had cases among their employees. The academy said in a statement Friday night that a civilian employee tested positive for the coronavirus and is being cared for in isolation in his home. State public health officials are investigating to determine whether any other personnel may have been exposed. Depending on the results of that investigation, additional precautionary measures may be taken. A T. Rowe Price spokesman said Friday that one of its Baltimore employees tested positive for the virus and efforts to sanitize its Pratt Street headquarters are underway. The company notified all of its employees of the case and is requiring all those who work near or who had been in direct contact with the employee to self-quarantine for 14 days, the spokesman said. The state continued to implement emergency measures Friday to try to stem the spread of the disease. National Guard members and their vehicles started to appear in downtown Baltimore to assist with the response. Hogan called on all students returning from spring break to self-quarantine for the next 14 days and avoid people over 60. “This should not in any way be treated as an extension of spring break,” Hogan said on Twitter. “If you ignore this recommendation, you are endangering yourself and the health of others.” State officials Friday also closed Motor Vehicle Administration branch offices statewide effective at 4:30 p.m. Friday. The governor appealed to Congress for direct financial help to be sent to state governments and warned the elderly of scams. Hogan, who declared a state emergency on March 5, activated the National Guard a week later. More than 2,000 members of the Guard are expected to be called to duty statewide. Ricci said Guard units will be engaged in transporting patients, conducting temperature screenings at state facilities, helping local hospitals set up triage tents, and supporting the State Emergency Operations Center and a pilot assessment location at FedEx Field in Prince George’s County. Lt. Col. Wayde Minami said members of the Guard were being processed into service in small groups and heading out for various missions. While some guard members and their vehicles were spotted on the streets of Baltimore near Camden Yards and a downtown hotel Friday afternoon, no mission has yet been established in the city, Minami said. Minami said the Guard was working already at the Strategic National Stockpile, a government repository of drugs and medical supplies near Washington. Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said he expected Guard units to help with meal distribution to children at city schools and with logistical support of the city’s hospitals. “I am confident that the deployment of the National Guard will help ensure Baltimore City has everything it needs to fully address COVID-19,” Young said in a news release. The state’s latest cases were found across nine Maryland counties and Baltimore City. Wicomico and Worcester made the list for the first time Friday, with one positive case each. The majority of new cases, 18, were confirmed in Montgomery County. Prince George’s County also reported eight new cases. Combined, the two counties have accounted for more than half the state’s number of confirmed cases at 82 total. The majority of Maryland cases have been reported in people between ages 18 and 64, officials said. The virus, which has accounted for more than 11,000 deaths worldwide, is said to be more fatal to seniors and those with compromised immune systems. The state updates the number of cases confirmed each day at 10 a.m. while counties and local jurisdictions may announce cases separate from those confirmed by the state. Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski issued a statement following the announcement of the first death in the county. “This sad passing is a stark reminder of the seriousness of the crisis we face, nd it breaks my heart to know that this will not be the last life we lose to this pandemic,” he said. “That is why, even as we grieve, we also each need to do our part to reduce the spread and flatten the curve. Stay home. Practice social distancing. Those failing to do their part only add to the toll this crisis will take. We can save lives, but only if we take this seriously and continue to work together.” On Friday, the governor’s office also released a COVID-19 resource guide listing the new coronavirus-related policies in place around the state. Financial help Hogan, in his role as chairman of the National Governors Association, appealed to Congress for direct financial help to be sent to state governments. The governors need “at least $150 billion in immediate direct aid to the states, with maximum flexibility for governors’ COVID-19 efforts,” Hogan and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote to Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. Cuomo, a Democrat, is vice chairman of the governors’ association. “Despite the uncertainty and rapidly-changing nature of this pandemic, governors are working tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of their residents,” Hogan and Cuomo wrote. “To meet this challenge, governors are asking for a new program that would provide unrestricted state fiscal support in addition to traditional funding streams.” State governments already are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the coronavirus response effort, they wrote. Having money from the federal government would help in paying unemployment benefits to laid-off workers, helping blunt the negative effects on shuttered businesses, providing education to children, providing child care and maintaining public transportation systems, among other needs, they wrote. Hogan and Cuomo also asked Congress to increase the share of money that the federal government puts into Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Meanwhile, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a Friday Facebook Live webcast that seniors ought to be on the lookout for phone, mail and internet-based scams. He said the office had been made aware of “a series of scams already” related to the coronavirus and emphasized that fraudsters tend to target the elderly. Seniors usually have more money than younger people, he said, and thus should be on the lookout for any “grandparent scams,” or requests to wire money, purchase gift cards or write checks for people posing as family members in trouble. “I can promise you, your grandson or granddaughter is not in jail Mexico,” he said. If a family member does happen to be on spring break or out of town, “ask them questions only your grandchild can answer" he said. Frosh also asked Marylanders to report instances of price gouging, saying the office is "seeing it all over the place, all over the state.” Individuals harboring sanitizers, masks, toilet paper and cases of water have been jacking up the price and selling them for profit, he said. The office was made aware Friday of a case of water selling for $38, he said. But new legislation passed in emergency fashion this week in the General Assembly provides the attorney general with broader authority to enforce price gouging laws. Hogan already signed the measure into law, which makes it effective immediately, Frosh said. The law designates products and services for which price gouging is illegal, a list that includes food, fuel, cleaning supplies, medical equipment and medication. Violations can incur penalties of up to $10,000 per violation, Frosh said. “Up until the day before yesterday, we were powerless to do anything,” he said. “Potential penalties are very high, but our office will do everything we can to aggressively enforce this law against price gouging.” Those who wish to report instances of price gouging and other ongoing scams are encouraged to contact the attorney general’s office at 410-528-8662 or email photographs and details to consumer@attorneygeneral.gov.

Harford nursing students, all wanting to help people, train amid the coronavirus pandemic
.W
The final semester for Harford Community College students pursuing an associate’s degree in nursing is typically reserved for the “practicum,” a period in which students work with patients in a hospital setting under nurse’s guidance. “You’re the nurse,” said fourth-semester student Kristin Beatty, who noted that students “have someone there that is guiding you and helping you in your experience.” Beatty and her classmates have not been able to do that during the spring 2020 semester, though, as HCC officials have closed the Bel Air campus to students and switched to all-online instruction to help limit the spread of the coronavirus. Online instruction has been happening since March 23, and it will continue through the summer session, according to the college’s website. Students typically work with a nurse preceptor during their 100-hour practicum and are “immersed in the role of the RN and have the opportunity to practice and develop their skills” under the preceptor’s supervision, Jessica Powers, assistant professor of nursing, wrote in an email. “The intense focus of this experience increases students’ confidence and facilitates transition into practice,” Powers added. Another fourth-semester student, Georgia Garcia, noted that “our lovely professors" have provided an alternative so students can still gain experience from working with patients, that being virtual simulations. Garcia, 21, of Abingdon, said the sims are “really educational, and I am very glad we have an opportunity to learn.” The college is using the trademark vSim for Nursing program, which gives students “the opportunity to make decisions and provide interventions like a nurse would in the clinical setting,” according to Powers. Students are presented with an interactive video scenario that shows patients presenting with varied conditions. The students must determine how they will provide care based on the scenario, and the system gives them feedback on what they did right and how they can improve, according to the students. They also can “reflect on the experience and engage in discussion with faculty to help them learn even more,” Powers wrote. “Harford Community [College] has really prepared us for these scenarios, so I felt well prepared going into them,” Garcia said. Beatty, 35, of Forest Hill, said the virtual patients are not real people, so students have room to “mess up” and redo the simulations multiple times and improve their skills. “Even though it’s not hands on, it’s giving me the opportunity to [improve] my organizational skills, in planning my patients’ care,” she said. Student nurses learn how to plan out daily care routines for patients on their shift, handle multiple patients at the same time and prioritize treatment based on each person’s needs. “It’s helping you prioritize your care and organize how your day would go,” Beatty said. Chris Schemm, another fourth-semester student, said the simulations are “pretty interesting” and that students are told “in bullet-point form” how they can improve. He praised the education he has received through the two-year associate’s program. “I’d say it’s helpful, but for me, myself, I’d rather work in a hospital face-to-face with patients and get that kind of experience,” said Schemm, 29, of the White Hall area. All three students, Beatty, Garcia and Schemm, are in the ATB, or associate’s to bachelor’s, degree program, meaning they are dually enrolled in the HCC and Towson University nursing programs. Towson and HCC have operated a “2+2” partnership since 2014, through which students can earn an associate’s degree at the community college and then pursue a bachelor’s from Towson through upper-level classes. Harford graduates can take classes, including nursing, in the Towson University in Northeastern Maryland, or TUNE, building on the west side of the HCC campus. Hands-on instruction Beatty, Garcia and Schemm, as well as others in the ATB program, are slated to earn an associate’s and bachelor’s degree in nursing once they complete the two-and-a-half-year program in December. There could be opportunities to complete a practicum during the fall 2020 semester, depending on conditions related to the pandemic, according to the students. They also had opportunities for hands-on instruction and training in past semesters through clinical rotations. Students visited medical facilities in groups and worked with faculty and medical professionals in areas related to what they were studying in class at the time. Beatty said she spent one clinical rotation in labor and delivery of newborns. She plans to train to be a nurse midwife after she earns her bachelor’s degree and eventually work in that field. Beatty has two step-children and three biological children, and her three youngest were delivered by the same midwife. She described the experience as “great” and “holistic.” “I really appreciate the way they care for their patients, the way that they nurture their patients,” Beatty said of nurse midwives, who can provide care either in a hospital or home setting. She praised nurse midwives as having “a passion for promoting women’s health care and being advocates for women in general.” “I think it’s going to be a way for me to still do labor and delivery, but also promote women’s health at the same time,” Beatty said. She noted that her midwife has volunteered to be her preceptor when she starts midwifery school. A preceptor is someone with experience in the medical field who serves as a teacher and mentor to students, as well as people who are making a transition to a new field of service, a person who will “help me before I can fully be on my own” on the hospital floor, Beatty said. Schemm recalled “daily huddles” during his most recent clinical rotation earlier in the spring semester, as hospital staff discussed patient care amid the increasing number of cases of COVID-19, the potentially fatal respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. One topic of discussion was ensuring health care workers had enough PPE, or personal protective equipment. “That is very essential for health care workers, if they’re going to be in close proximity ... taking care of patients that have been diagnosed with this virus,” said Schemm, who wants to be a surgical nurse. Garcia, who wants to be in the field of pediatric oncology and work with children with cancer, recalled getting a boost from a patient while on a clinical rotation during her second semester. “A patient had told me I was going to make a great nurse, and they were really proud of me,” Garcia said. Garcia gives credit to her instructors, as well as the classroom facilities in the “wonderful” Darlington Hall at HCC. Darlington Hall, which opened in 2015, is the central location for nursing and allied health programs. It has equipment such as an ambulance simulator and suites set up as hospital rooms with mannequins designed to simulate adult, child and infant patients with a variety of programmable medical needs. “I like to say that I’ve learned from the greatest,” Garcia said. “We have wonderful lab staff and clinical instructors.” Instructors and staff “have taught us so much,” such as conducting a “head-to-toe” physical assessment of a patient, taking vital signs such as temperature and blood pressure, developing their bedside manner, as well as keeping themselves safe, according to Garcia. “They’ve been with us from Day One to our very last day, and they’ve given us nothing but the best advice to take out into the field,” she said. Working during a pandemic It is “kind of concerning” that the COVID-19 pandemic is happening as Schemm and his classmates come to the latter part of their education in nursing and that they could “go from school right into a health care setting” where health care workers are battling a highly-contagious disease. More than 9,200 health care workers in the U.S. had been infected with COVID-19 as of April 9, based on confirmed cases reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC report, dated April 17, acknowledges that “this is likely an underestimation because [health care worker] status was available for only 16% of reported cases nationwide.” At least 27 workers have died from COVID-19, according to the report. There also have been reports of hospital workers suffering from fatigue, burnout and mental health issues as they struggle to keep patients alive, keep themselves safe and deal with multiple patient deaths. Beatty said she has heard from friends who work in the medical field and how COVID-19 has affected their lives, such as forcing them to isolate themselves from their families so they do not risk infecting their loved ones. People she knows, who work with COVID-19 patients, have been ensuring they take all precautions when at work, such as wearing PPE, and taking additional precautions when they get home such as not wearing their work shoes in the house and showering immediately. “I’m afraid for a lot of people to get burnt out,” she said. She said she is “fearful” for herself, as well, since she has had asthma since childhood and her daughter has “major breathing problems.” People with underlying health conditions, such as respiratory issues, are at greater risk from COVID-19. “I am hoping, by the time I get out there, it’s not going to be as prevalent as it is now, but there is a fear that it could be,” Beatty said. She is president of the Student Nurses’ Association at HCC, and the organization typically does community outreach events which have not been possible during the pandemic. She and her fellow association members are working to find ways to support local first responders, health care workers and hospitals through donations. Schemm, who stresses the need for hospital workers to have enough PPE, lives with his parents and is concerned for their health during the pandemic. He usually wears a mask while in the grocery store and keeps a bottle of hand sanitizer and sanitary wipes in his car, plus he has a designated spot in the house for his groceries. If he has been out in public for an extended period of time, he will go straight from his car to his parents’ basement, put his clothes in the laundry and take a shower. He also wipes down any surfaces in the house that he touches. All of these precautions come before he starts working in the medical field. “If it’s still pretty prevalent, I just worry about the possibility of bringing this home with me,” Schemm said. “There are precautions I take, but you can’t really foresee everything.” The pandemic has been a topic of discussion in HCC nursing classes, and students and instructors talk about matters such as “disaster nursing” — providing care during situations such as a natural disaster or a pandemic — and ensuring that nurses and other medical workers practice “self care,” according to Garcia. Beatty said some training simulations have involved patients with COVID-19, plus she has read up on the disease. The disease has been “an important topic in the classroom,” as students read articles in medical journals and conducted simulations with COVID-19 patients, plus discussed their concerns about entering the workforce during the pandemic, according to Powers. She noted that many students have prior experience in the health care field, such as licensed practical nurses, technicians, security guards and other jobs, and a number have signed up to assist in the field through “emergency staffing pools.” “For the most part, they are excited about getting out there and helping,” Powers stated. Burnout and stress were, “unfortunately,” common in the nursing field well before the pandemic, according to Powers. “We teach our students strategies to manage stress and burnout throughout our program,” she stated. “As they enter the workforce, we will continue to remind them to take care of themselves so that they can provide great care to patients.” Garcia praised the many health care workers who are doing their part to battle COVID-19, including doctors, nurses, certified nursing assistants, licensed practical nurses, physicians’ assistants, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers and others. “There are so many people,” she said. “[They] are truly heroes and are very inspirational for those who are starting their nursing journey.” Why nursing? Each student had a different path that brought them to study nursing, but they have a common desire — helping others. Schemm has long been interested in medicine, science and technology. As a child, he and his sister watched medical documentaries and television shows, recalling that “we both have a fondness for shows like ‘Scrubs.’” He earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from Salisbury University on the Eastern Shore in 2015, and he particularly enjoyed classes on human anatomy and how organisms interact with the human body. He worked as a lab technician after college, testing drinking water and wastewater samples. His lab company worked on a contract basis for many entities, including Harford County Public Schools, residential customers in Cecil and Harford counties, churches, campsites, even the IKEA distribution center in Perryville. The laboratory work was interesting for Schemm, but he “had nursing on my mind.” He wanted to work in a science-based field but also help people, so he “decided to go for it” and pursue nursing. “It’s just been great, applying the knowledge from my previous career as a lab technician,” Schemm said. “I really enjoyed the science aspect, but I felt like I was missing something; I like interaction with people, and through nursing, it’s sort of scratching that itch in a way.” He recalled a time when his father experienced health issues serious enough to put him in the hospital. Schemm was able to interact with some of the nurses caring for his dad. “They were very approachable and they answered my questions, and [those] of any other family member,” Schemm said. He noted that much less time and money is needed to train to be a nurse, compared to the many years of schooling required to become a doctor. He also highlighted the holistic level of care nurses provide for their patients — beyond tending to just their medical needs — as a key reason for pursuing the nursing profession. “Nurses are the ones that are advocating for patients — essentially, they’re a caregiver, too,” said Schemm, who noted that doctors also serve as patient advocates. More and more men are working in nursing, traditionally a female-dominated profession. Schemm was able to interact with male nurses when his father was hospitalized, as well as during his clinical rotations. He said there have been few issues, although he recalled being mistaken for a doctor on one clinical shift, even though he was wearing a badge that identified him as a nursing student. “I think it’s a little beneficial, now that there are more and more men that are becoming nurses,” Schemm said. Seventy-nine nursing students are scheduled to graduate from HCC this month, including 16 men and 63 women, according to Powers. Beatty’s mother is a retired nurse who spent about 25 years in the profession and worked as a charge nurse, handling many night shifts and being on call. “She definitely has been supportive — she still knows everything,” she said of her mother. Beatty has previously worked in the field of patient care as a certified optician with the Katzen Eye Group. She became a stay-at-home mom seven years ago when her youngest child was born. “I’ve always had compassion and I always like helping people, and I think of myself as a people person,” she said. Garcia is the first in her family to go into nursing. She said she has “a strong passion to help others who are sick, who are ill — I’ve just always loved helping people.” She enjoys seeing patients getting “back on their feet and going back out into the world and living their lives.” “When you help someone who is sick and you see them get better, it brings a smile to my face,” she said. Garcia recalled when a boy whose family lives next door to hers was being treated for cancer. She said the boy is now healthy, a middle school student and “loves to play baseball.” The care that nurses provided to him, as well as his family, during treatment was a key factor in what inspired Garcia to consider the profession. “He’s such a sweet kid, and I’ve always just been interested in helping people ... just to see what a wonderful job the nurses did of taking care of him, and how special that was to that family, inspired me to look more into that field,” Garcia said. Harford Community College typically holds a “pinning ceremony” at the end of each semester, as well as the summer session, to honor those who have earned an associate’s degree in nursing — 50 graduates were honored in December during the fall 2019 semester pinning ceremony, according to the HCC website. The pinning ceremony for the spring 2020 graduates, scheduled for May 19, will not happen in the live format as initially planned because of the pandemic. Faculty, staff and class representatives are developing plans for an alternate pinning ceremony, as “these soon-to-be graduates have worked incredibly hard and they deserve to be recognized,” Powers stated. “As far as how to prepare students to enter the health care field in its current state, realistically this is something unprecedented,” Powers wrote. “I’m confident that we’ve done our best to give them a great start, but they will need to continue their professional development and learn throughout their long careers as nurses.”

Worker at Havre de Grace school construction site dies from coronavirus; site shut down day prior when he tested positive
.W
Harford County schools and the company managing construction of the new Havre de Grace Middle/High School building shut down the site earlier this week after learning a contracted worker tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The worker died the next day. The school system was notified by Hess Construction on Monday that the contractual employee working at the site tested positive for COVID-19 and a decision was made that day to shut down work at the site effective Tuesday, said Jillian Lader, a spokesperson for Harford County Public Schools. On Tuesday, school officials were notified of the employee’s death, she said. The employee was last on the work site on March 31. “As an added precaution, a collaborative decision was made between HCPS and Hess Construction, to shut the worksite down for 14 days,” effective April 7, Lader said. Michael Hess, the executive vice president for Hess Construction, which has a consulting and managerial role in the job, said the infected man worked for SA Halac Iron Works, a metalworking company based in northern Virginia. The worker was performing a job that did not require much exposure to other people, but nine to 10 others whom he could have had contact with are now self-quarantining, Hess said. Hess said the worker, a resident of Prince George’s County, had worked on the site from March 26 until he started showing symptoms March 31. He was tested when the symptoms appeared, but the results took five days to come back. “As soon as we got wind someone was showing symptoms, we removed them from the job site,” Hess said. “As soon as they got a positive test, we shut it down.” The worker died shortly after that positive test was returned, Hess said. Other on-site workers have been tested as well — though they have not shown symptoms — and the rest of SA Halac’s workers on-site self-quarantined when their colleague’s symptoms first appeared, Hess said. Messages left with SA Halac Iron Works seeking comment were not returned as of 4 p.m. Friday. There were about 100 workers on the site, Hess said. Many of the contractors he has spoken with said they would not redeploy them to another job out of an abundance of caution. Neither the infected man nor others who were working on the school’s construction went to other job sites, Hess said. “Luckily it was not someone who came in contact with a lot of people,” Hess said. As of Friday, the state was reporting 110 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Harford County, but no deaths among Harford residents. Prince George’s County, where the worker was from, has 1,716 confirmed cases — the most of any jurisdiction in Maryland and approximately a quarter of the nearly 7,000 confirmed cases statewide. Of Maryland’s 171 deaths due to the respiratory disease, 42 are Prince George’s County residents. The school system has utilized guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Health Department to ensure safe practices on the work site, Lader said in her statement. Ground was broken in April 2018 on the $80 million combined Havre de Grace high and middle school building off of Lewis Lane. The 250,000-square-foot building was projected to open in time for the 2020-21 school year. Construction considered essential work Construction has been exempted from Gov. Larry Hogan’s mandatory closures of many businesses in the state in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It was deemed essential because it ties into so many other industries and services — healthcare, education and numerous others, according to Mike Henderson, the president of the Associated Builders and Contractors of Greater Baltimore, a trade association representing the non-union construction industry. “It touches just about every part of our economy … it is just so expansive,” he said. Although he could not speak to the specific case in Havre de Grace — which he called “heartbreaking” to hear — Henderson said that risks of spreading the virus on construction sites can be mitigated. Construction companies have been staggering shifts and taking workers’ temperatures as safeguards, he said. The virus does not make construction sites inherently more dangerous places to work, as they are affected the same as other workplaces. “[The risks are] the same as they would be in any environment. That is why social distancing and hand-washing is taking place,” Henderson said. “The guys are trained to practice safety eight hours a day on the job; this just adds one more element to it, but it is not going to make doing the work less safe.” While construction is considered essential, local health departments do have the ability to take action against essential businesses, including construction sites, “unable or unwilling to operate in a manner that does not pose an unreasonable risk of exacerbating the spread of COVID-19,” under an executive order signed by Hogan earlier this week. Under the order, the county health official can order the business to change its practices or demand its closure. A failure to comply with the health officer’s order could result in a year in jail and a $5,000 fine. As of Friday, there have not been any businesses or construction sites in Harford County shut down for not following CDC protocols, Molly Mraz, a spokesperson for the Harford County Health Department, said in an email. CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this article was unclear when the decision was made to shut down work at the Havre de Grace school site. It has been updated.

Maryland reports nearly 60% of coronavirus victims are long-term care residents as 4-day decline in new cases ends
.W
Nearly three-fifths of Marylanders killed by the coronavirus are residents of long-term care facilities, according to the state’s update of nursing home data Wednesday for the first time since last week. The Maryland Department of Health reported that 793 of the state’s 1,338 victims, almost 60%, were residents of nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities and similar long-term care facilities. An additional 11 deaths were staff members of those facilities, with more than one of every five of Maryland’s confirmed infections being a resident or staff member of congregate living facilities. The state also reported 1,045 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, ending a run of four consecutive days with fewer new confirmed cases than the previous day. To get a handle on the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus, Gov. Larry Hogan announced plans last week to test all nursing home residents and staff and establish specialized bridge teams of nurses to support facilities with staff shortages. “We’re going through it systematically with the hottest ones with the biggest problems and working our way down the list,” the Republican governor said in a news conference in Annapolis on Wednesday. Facing limited testing capacity and other logistical challenges, the state remains “at a very early stage” in that process, said Joe DeMattos, president and CEO of the Health Facilities Association of Maryland. Resident testing at the 226 nursing homes across the state should begin this week, state officials say. Testing of staff, whom many believe spread the virus into nursing homes, won’t take place until plans are in place for replacing those who test positive. ”The reality is right now, in Maryland and in many places across the country, we still don’t have adequate testing capacity, which means tests, swabs and lab capacity," DeMattos said Wednesday. “At this point, state teams have not visited or tested anywhere near the majority of Maryland nursing homes.” Although those who are at least 60 years old represent only 30% of the state’s caseload, they account for 88% of the state’s victims, among those whose age was known. More than a quarter of the infections in those 80 or older have resulted in death, with 55 of the state’s 99 probable deaths — those believed to be caused by the virus but not confirmed by a laboratory test — being in that age range. Known outbreaks worsened at several facilities with deaths more than doubling to 21 at Future Care Lochearn in Northeast Baltimore, site of the state’s largest outbreak. There were five more deaths at Future Care Chesapeake, bringing its toll to 18. Deaths also surged at Erickson Living’s Riderwood Village - Arbor Ridge in Beltsville, to 23 from six last week, and the Clinton Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Prince George’s County, which had 20 deaths, up from none a week ago. “Our nursing homes have been hot spots for the virus in part because of slow federal and state responses,” said House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones at a virtual meeting of the legislature’s COVID-19 work group. “We’re getting better but we have a lot of challenges ahead of us.” Despite promises of universal testing in nursing homes, the state is “nowhere close to making that a reality," said U.S. Rep. Anthony Brown, the unsuccessful 2014 Democratic nominee for governor. “We need more than hopeful assurances to stem this tide," Brown said. “The lack of an actionable plan for testing and safeguarding these facilities — two months after the first case of COVID-19 in a nursing home — is frankly a shameful failure.” The 1,045 new cases announced Wednesday brought the state to 28,163 total confirmed coronavirus cases. While Wednesday ended four days in a row with declining cases, five of Maryland’s eight highest new case counts have come in the past week. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford said Wednesday morning that the increase in confirmed cases is expected, given expanded testing. He said the numbers of people who are dying and who are hospitalized are more important to follow than the total number of cases. “We feel that our efforts with regard to mitigation … have allowed us to not only limit the amount of the spread, but more so to make sure our hospitals and health care system are not overwhelmed,” Rutherford said at the state of a Board of Public Works meeting. Hogan’s office has pointed to declining or leveling in hospitalization rates and intensive care cases as the metrics it is monitoring closely to determine when to begin to ease stay-at-home orders and reopen Maryland. The state reported 1,707 coronavirus patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday morning, compared to 1,693 on Tuesday. Of those, 584 are in intensive care, up from 573 on Tuesday. Racial disparities in the data remained in line with prior days, with African Americans accounting for more than 42% of Maryland’s infections and fatalities, among those whose race was known, while representing 30% of the state’s overall population. Those who are Hispanic, 10% of Maryland’s population, represent nearly a quarter of the state’s cases. The top seven ZIP codes in the state by total confirmed cases are all in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, Maryland’s two jurisdictions with the most cases. Two Baltimore area ZIP codes, 21215 and 21224, rank eighth and ninth, respectively. Baltimore Sun reporters Pamela Wood and Luke Broadwater contributed to this article.

With courses closed by coronavirus, golfers, managers left to wonder how to run business and beat ‘cabin fever’
.W
Although Monday’s rain scared away golfers at the Baltimore Classic Five golf courses, interim executive director Tom Pierce said that there had been plenty of busy days recently. The word he was getting from golfers was that playing a round was their chance to get outside, exercise and relieve stress during an otherwise anxious time because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected 288 people in Maryland after 44 new cases were announced Monday. That all changed Monday when Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan ordered the closure of all nonessential businesses in the state — including all public and private golf courses — effective at 5 p.m. Monday to further slow the spread of COVID-19. “We totally understand what the Governor is doing, totally support him and get it,” said Pierce, who oversees Carroll Park, Clifton Park, Forest Park, Mount Pleasant and Pine Ridge under the Baltimore Municipal Golf Corporation. “Of course, it’s something that we all hope the situation ends sooner rather than later — not saying when we’re closed, but the whole coronavirus altogether.” As for how it’s going to effect business, Pierce added: “That will probably be determined by the length of the time we are closed.” At Rolling Road Golf Club in Catonsville, general manager Daniel Taylor and his staff also were in scramble mode, meeting to devise a plan moving forward just hours after Hogan made the announcement and minutes before closing up shop to meet the 5 p.m. mandate. After a productive past week, capped by Friday’s 83-degree day that brought plenty of golfers that willingly followed the club’s measures to provide a safe environment, Taylor also couldn’t provide a ballpark figure on potential losses based on how quickly or slowly the crisis concludes. The immediate concern for the private club, which has a membership roll exceeding 300, is being able to efficiently maintain the golf course while it’s in a holding pattern. “The big thing we’re taking on right now is what does it take to maintain the course in a manner that once we re-open, we’re able to get right back to the quality conditions in the fastest amount of time while still saving money, squeezing the turnip so to speak,” he said. In addition to revenue, membership losses are also a concern at Rolling Road and other private clubs if the pandemic stretches into the summer months. For Ellicott City resident Jack Degele, the news that his 11:36 a.m. tee time Thursday at The Links of Challedon in Mount Airy is now quashed was a major disappointment, but he understands Hogan’s stance. The 72-year-old, once-a-week-golfer, estimates that he has averaged between 50 and 60 rounds a year — playing for pleasure and business since he became a regular participant of the game a decade ago. The owner of Small Business Alliance, a commercial referral service based in Ellicott City, he often uses a day on the golf course to reach out to his clients. “The good part about it is you get him away from his business, so you can relax and the phones aren’t ringing and people aren’t running in asking how to do something and you can focus on what his next moves may be. So we’ll discuss strategies in a relaxed manner,” Degele said. “So it’s very disappointing. Of course, we’re in the middle of something that we never thought we would be in and we have to do what we have to do, but I sure hope it ends quickly because I look forward to playing golf.” The same could be said for the many golf enthusiasts of all ages throughout the area, including Fulton resident John Yun. He had been planning a golf outing this week with several friends to cure a case of "cabin fever" after being home all of last week with his wife and daughter. While he questioned the thoroughness of Gov. Hogan's decision, he understood that golf courses rank very low on the list of essential businesses. "Golf can be a solitary sport, and human interaction can be limited," said Yun, a 49-year-old senior counsel at Stanley Black & Decker. "But I understand that some people are irresponsible, and so the state has to step in to reduce the chances of the spread. I understand that golf can seem silly in the midst of a pandemic, and so I don't have a major issue with the decision." He acknowledged that finding something to break the boredom of practicing self-quarantine just got more difficult. “This is tough,” he said. “I’ve been doing a little running, but there’s only so much running I can do. I’ve been riding bikes with my daughter and taking family walks, but that’s starting to get old. I’ll admit the cabin fever is starting to set in, and I’m not really sure what I’m going to do.” Baltimore Sun reporter Edward Lee contributed to this article.

‘The demand is high, the need is great’: Howard teacher organizes donation drives to help during coronavirus pandemic
.W
By 10 a.m. every day, Columbia resident Erika Strauss Chavarria is out the door. With her trunk filled to the brim with diapers, boxes of pasta and cans of vegetables, Strauss Chavarria collects the text messages and Facebook direct messages she’s received since the previous day to map out her route, and she’s off. Maneuvering through Columbia neighborhoods, she gathers donations from people’s doorsteps and, by 10:45 a.m., she’s parked at Swansfield Elementary School. Like many Americans, the spread of the new coronavirus means that Strauss Chavarria has been thrown out of her regular routine as a Spanish teacher at Wilde Lake High School in Columbia and has settled into a new normal. For Strauss Chavarria, that means organizing a daily donation drive at five locations for Howard County residents in need. “We have a lot of need in our community. People don’t realize how much need there is in Howard County,” she said. “[We need] to make sure our families were sustained in a steady fashion.” Strauss Chavarria, 37, created a public Facebook group, Columbia Community Cares, on March 14 to see what needs existed in the community and to find people who could help meet those demands. She started by adding a few of her friends. From there it took off. As of Monday, the group had more than 900 members. Every day from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., a rotating group of volunteers, many of whom are Howard teachers, set up tables outside five county schools — Swansfield Elementary, Lake Elkhorn Middle School, Wilde Lake Middle School and Oakland Mills Middle School, all in Columbia, and Howard High School in Ellicott City — and fill them with donated food, toiletries and household items people need. Gov. Larry Hogan issued a new “stay-at-home” directive Monday aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. According to Strauss Chavarria, the group will continue to operate with no interruption in its services. Howard County residents can walk or drive up to any of the five sites and collect the items they need. Strauss Chavarria has taped signs to each of the tables encouraging social distancing and asking people to stand 6 feet apart. She keeps hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes at each table for volunteers to practice safe hygiene. They also spray each of the donated items with disinfectant. “Safety is the No. 1 priority,” Strauss Chavarria said. “Everything that the state and the county are recommending, we are sure to do.” The five sites are set up near the Howard County Public School System’s “Grab-N- Go” sites where children younger than 18 can go to receive a snack, lunch and dinner for the current day, and breakfast for the next morning. On March 25, state schools Superintendent Karen Salmon announced that the statewide public school closure would continue through April 24. In response to the extension, Strauss Chavarria wrote in a Facebook post that the group’s donation distributions/collections would continue through at least April 12. Strauss Chavarria said her volunteer group aims to supplement the school system’s work. When she began, the school system was not providing meals during the weekends, and she said her tables were the only available resource to people older than 18 or those without children. On March 26, the school system announced it would begin serving weekend meals April 3. Maryland Department of Health officials announced Monday that the state reached 1,413 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 96 in Howard. The county health department on Sunday announced the first coronavirus-related deaths in Howard, two men ages 75 and 90. Approximately 42,000 Maryland residents filed for jobless benefits during the week of March 16 to 20, including more than 1,500 in Howard, creating a need for basic resources across the state, a void Strauss Chavarria hopes to fill through her efforts. “We’re building the plane as we fly it,” she said. “I'm really trying to keep up with the need each day.” In addition to the Facebook group, volunteers have also passed out flyers around the community, in English and Spanish, with an email address and phone number so residents without transportation can get what they need. If Strauss Chavarria receives an email or phone request, she delivers those goods directly to residents’ doors. She said she’s made about 20 of what she calls “wish list” deliveries. Meg Feroli, 59, of Columbia, has worked as a substitute teacher at Oakland Mills Middle for 12 years and has been volunteering at the school’s table since Strauss Chavarria put out the call. “I was looking for something to do with school closed and asked [Strauss Chavarria] if I could help,” Feroli said. “[I’m] happy to find something to direct my energy toward.” Feroli said she worries that, as the pandemic continues to spread and affect more community members, it might become more difficult for volunteers to donate their time or for community members to let go of extra items around their own homes. “I just hope that we are able to maintain the level that we have started because it has been incredible,” she said. “The demand is high, the need is great, but volunteers keep showing up with bags of food [at sites].” The group has been 100% dependent on donations from the community. Since the group first set up tables March 18, it has collected $4,390 in donations via Venmo, Cash App, PayPal and cash. Strauss Chavarria said she’s been unable to keep track of the amount of physical donations, but on March 25 for the first time, they completely ran out of the items at all of the sites. Strauss Chavarria frequently posts item requests she gets from families in need on the Facebook group page; within minutes, volunteers offer to use Instacart to get the items to her or send her a location where she can pick them up. Those interactions sometimes happen hourly. Steve Whiddon, a band and strings teacher at Laurel Woods Elementary School and lifelong Columbia resident, has been volunteering for the past week at the Swansfield Elementary table. “There’s probably more need [than] we have people showing up,” Whiddon said. “I hope people realize that we’re there.” Whiddon, 47, was initially concerned that, as time went on, donations would dwindle, but he said he’s seen the opposite. As Strauss Chavarria has put calls out on Facebook, people continue to answer. His concerns have now shifted, and Whiddon wonders how the group’s efforts will adapt to educators switching to virtual teaching and that taking up most of their time. “We’ll see what happens when distance learning comes into effect,” Whiddon said. “I’ve been fortunate enough to be home, so it’s the perfect opportunity to give back a bit.” The Howard County school system has not yet announced specific details of its distance learning plans. Teachers started engaging virtually with students and families on Monday to offer support but cannot give out assignments or assessments. School staff members will begin professional learning this week to prepare for distance instruction. Strauss Chavarria also has called on former students, many of whom have started to volunteer and have connected her to residents in need. Brandy Lemus, a Wilde Lake Class of 2016 graduate, has been a liaison connecting Strauss Chavarria to community members who haven’t seen the flyers or Facebook posts. “I’ve known this family for a while. She’s a single mother, [and] she was in need of food and the basics. [Strauss Chavarria] was able to get all of that for three families [including the single mother], living in one home, for nine people,” Lemus, 21, said. “[Strauss Chavarria] is one of those people who has always helped. She sees a need for something, and she’s up for the challenge.” Strauss Chavarria said she has tried to make every option available when it comes to collecting the necessary goods. If people post in the Columbia Community Care Facebook group that they have items to donate, she collects their addresses and picks up the donations the next day. If people are able, they also can drop items off at one of the five sites when volunteers are set up. “Grassroots activism is part of my existence. I am very aware of the needs of this county. I was not surprised at the demand,” Strauss Chavarria said. “If anything, this has exposed the inequities and economic inequalities that we have in our school system and across this country.” She said if she had more volunteers and more time, she would open up more sites around the county. Until then, the group of volunteers continues to organize donations, separating them equally among the sites, and watch as community members help each other through these uncertain times. “It is miraculous and amazing how the community responds to calls [for donations],” she said. “This community has come together in a way that gives me faith in humanity. The level of generosity to make sure that we are all OK gives me hope.” To find out more information about the Columbia Community Care group and how to help, go to facebook.com/groups/807588256400584. Other ways to help in Howard County The Howard County Food Bank is seeking food and monetary donations. To donate funds, go to cac-hc.org/programs-services/food-assistance.

As a Baltimore doctor braces for the coronavirus surge, she trades scrubs and mask for a wedding dress
.W
In the end, the bride decided not to wear a face mask. Laura DiChiacchio stood beside a blooming cherry tree in Cylburn Arboretum, wearing a flowing tulle dress. She stood at least 6 feet from everyone ― except groom Ben Ambrose. The couple clutched each other’s hands. Most days, DiChiacchio, 33, wears scrubs and full protective gear as she navigates the halls of the University of Maryland Medical Center. The resident physician is among the thousands of health care workers bracing for a surge of coronavirus cases in Baltimore. They don’t know exactly when it will be. But soon, people with rasping coughs, spiking fevers and trouble breathing are expected to flood the city’s hospitals, desperate for care. When that happens, DiChiacchio will find herself on the front line of a global pandemic. And because of the nature of their jobs, medical workers are at greater risk of exposure to the virus. In hard-hit China, Italy and now, New York, doctors and nurses have died as they tried to save others. DiChiacchio and Ambrose didn’t want to wait any longer before becoming husband and wife. “It’s an uncertain time,” Ambrose, 26, said. “It’s nice to be certain about this.” They met about a year ago at Bookmakers Cocktail Club, a Federal Hill restaurant where Ambrose was working behind the bar. He served DiChiacchio wine and they started to talk. Ambrose, who is studying math at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, appreciated that DiChiacchio spoke to him as a person, not just as a bartender. One of their first conversations was about computational chemistry. They knew almost immediately that this was it. He treasures her sweetness and intellect. She loves that he is so earnest and kind. “He is a weirdo in all of the spectacular ways that Laura is,” said Dr. Rishi Kundi, a friend of the couple and the attending physician for DiChiacchio’s residency. “They’re each just fundamentally cheerful.” Even before the pandemic hit, the hectic schedule of a surgical resident meant the couple were forced to be strategic about maximizing their time together. Ambrose, while not a morning person, drives DiChiacchio to her 5:30 a.m. shifts. For them, those extra 15 minutes together are worth it. They planned a wedding for June, at a lavender farm in the Pacific Northwest, where they would be surrounded by relatives and friends. A honeymoon on Vancouver Island was to follow. DiChiacchio wanted to walk down the aisle carrying a bouquet of sunflowers. But flying across the country? Now, it’s too risky. Gathering all their loved ones together in one place? That would violate new federal guidelines on social distancing. The couple also are painfully aware of stories about doctors having to intubate their colleagues, of nurses contracting the virus, of people in their 20s and 30s dying of COVID-19. Some people who work in hospitals are distancing themselves from their families as a precaution. That would be nearly impossible in the one-bedroom loft DiChiacchio and Ambrose share in downtown Baltimore. Even if they did have the space, the couple can’t imagine being apart right now. “The idea that one of us could become ill and we didn’t spend the prior weeks and months together, we just couldn’t really wrap our minds around doing that,” DiChiacchio said. They’ve talked about what would happen if she gets sick. He has a list of physicians she wants to care for her, and knows how long she’d be willing to be on a ventilator. DiChiacchio didn’t want there to be any question about who would make medical decisions for her if she can’t herself. And they just wanted to make it all official. With the courts shut down, they had to petition a judge to get a marriage license. Since salons are closed, Ambrose helped DiChiacchio touch up the back of her pixie cut. Without a wedding cake, another doctor baked them cupcakes. The couple rushed to write their vows, pick a sunny spot for the ceremony and secure a bouquet. “I wanted sunflowers; we had access to tulips,” DiChiacchio said. “What a wonderful problem to have at this time.” On the day of their wedding Sunday, talk of the pandemic was kept in the background. Families also enjoying the 65-degree weather at the arboretum shouted, “Congratulations!” from behind homemade masks. The couple asked Ambrose’s younger brother to be their witness — and to keep tabs on their dog, Zelda, during the ceremony. Kundi, a trauma vascular surgeon and intensive care unit physician, was tapped to officiate; he got ordained online last week, just a few days after sitting down to make his will in the face of the risks of the impending surge. DiChiacchio promised Ambrose to wake up every day and make the choice to continue loving him. He vowed that he would support her, always, and hold her high. Kundi told the couple they stood “at the edge, not the end, of the world.” “Events may have changed our lives, but they’ve changed neither your intention nor your love,” he said. “The ground beneath our feet is shifting; your path over that ground remains unchanged.” He asked them if they would each place a ring on the other’s finger. “I do,” they echoed. “By the power vested in me,” Kundi said, “by the state of Maryland and, more importantly, as your attending, I pronounce you husband and wife.” This week, Ambrose is driving his new spouse to her hospital shift. DiChiacchio is securing an N95 respirator around her nose and mouth, steeling herself for what’s to come.

Maryland Gov. Hogan says officials have ‘moved on’ from coronavirus testing, are focusing on treating the sick
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Friday the federal government has been unable to keep up with the demands for testing for the coronavirus and the state of Maryland is now focusing on treating sick people. In an interview on MSNBC, Hogan acknowledged the United States is “behind” on testing for the virus. "Yes, we have a problem,” the Republican governor said. “There’s not enough tests. We’re dealing with that crisis right now in every single one of our states.” Hogan said the country is trying to ramp up testing capacity, but cannot keep pace with the spread of the novel coronavirus. As of Friday afternoon, there were 18 confirmed cases in Maryland. The state has stopped announcing how many people have been tested for the virus. "It’s just not going to be fast enough,” Hogan said of increasing testing capacity. “The real concern for us right now really isn’t about testing. It’s about stopping the spread. … Quite frankly, at some point, we’re not going to be arguing about the testing. We’re going to be taking care of sick people.” Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association, said he and fellow governors have shared their concerns about a lack of testing with the White House. “There’s concerns among all of us about what we don’t have,” he said. “They are not going to be able to get the tests ramped up in time. … I don’t believe they can ramp up fast enough. We’ve moved on from testing, quite frankly, to other things right now.” Hogan said the state was now more focused on limiting the spread of the disease through preventative measures and closures, while ramping up hospital capacity. State officials announced Thursday they were closing public schools for two weeks, and Hogan said he was activating the National Guard and limiting access to senior centers and the Port of Baltimore, among other measures. "Rather than talk about what they didn’t do and why the hospitals aren’t ready, why the tests aren’t ready, I just want to say, ‘What can we do right now?’” he said.

Maryland extends public schools closure until May 15 due to coronavirus
.W
Maryland officials have ordered public schools to remain closed until May 15 as deaths from the coronavirus pandemic continue to rise in the state. The decision, announced Friday by Superintendent of Schools Karen B. Salmon, means Maryland stopped short of joining a growing number of states that have closed schools for the rest of the academic year, requiring students to finish their spring work remotely. At a State House news conference with Gov. Larry Hogan, Salmon said she made the order after “extensive consultation with the State Board of Education and leading public health experts." She said students must continue learning remotely as the state evaluates the spread of the virus that has infected more than 11,500 Marylanders and killed more than 400. “This is one of those decisions we need to make incrementally,” Salmon said of not closing schools for the entire year. “We’ll take it little by little, once we see what the results are.” More than half of U.S. states have closed schools for the academic year, including neighboring Pennsylvania and Virginia. The District of Columbia closed schools through the end of the 2019-2020 academic year, as well, and Delaware’s governor has said his state likely will do the same. Maryland school districts typically are in session until mid- to late June. Salmon’s action was met with support from the state’s teachers’ union. “This is the right decision for the safety and health of our students, educators and state," said Maryland State Education Association President Cheryl Bost, a Baltimore County elementary school teacher. "Everyone’s safety is paramount, but we remain hopeful that educators and students will be able to spend time together again at their schools before this school year is over.” Some teachers and parents were surprised that Maryland did not close down schools Friday for the remainder of the school year, but they weren’t necessarily disappointed by the gradual approach. Cindy Sexton, president of the union that represents Baltimore County teachers, said teachers are still wishing for a couple of weeks of school. “They are holding out hope they will be able to connect with their students," Sexton said. “They realize it is not likely to happen.” Some teachers and students would be happy to go back for just two weeks in June, particularly seniors who could have their last days of school. But Sexton said teachers also understand that “nothing is more important than the safety or the health of the people involved.” Salmon said last week that she was ramping up online and distance-learning capabilities in case schools must remain closed even into the 2020-2021 academic year. Some epidemiologists have said the state could see a second wave of the virus in the fall. She said Friday that all school systems must submit to the Maryland State Department of Education plans for ongoing remote learning. The plans must include accountability measures for assessing student performance; professional development plans; and a description of how the school systems plan to address equity for special education students, English learners and homeless students, the superintendent said. Salmon added that the state is helping school systems to obtain take-home computing devices for students and to expand broadband capabilities. She noted a federal government stimulus package is slated to bring $207 million more in funding for Maryland’s schools to help address such needs. And, the superintendent said she’s working with local school systems to recognize high school seniors. “We want seniors and their families to have the opportunity to recognize their wonderful accomplishments from their time in high school and receive their diplomas," she said. Parents are concerned about how their children will get back on track after a long school closure. “My concern is what is going to happen next year. They are attempting continuity of learning now to have something for the kids, but it is not the greatest,” said Emory Young, the parent of two Baltimore County high school students. “Kids have lost a quarter of the year. We are going to have to look at what other adjustments are going to have to be made to catch them up.” Joe Kane, a Baltimore City school parent, said he is grateful students still will get food and some services. “It is good that we are getting more guidance,” Kane said. “Parents are expecting schools to be closed for the rest of the yea, not sure why we haven’t made that decision.” However, Kane said he is fine with Salmon’s decision to keep pushing the final decision out. Prior to Friday, Salmon had ordered schools closed through April 24 while state officials evaluated the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Maryland officials are considering how they can slowly relax Hogan’s executive orders closing nonessential businesses and limiting gatherings. But before doing so, the governor said, he needs to see two consecutive weeks of decreasing deaths and hospitalizations from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus. This week, the state experienced its “deadliest week to date” from the contagion. But Hogan stressed the number of Marylanders who have recovered rose by 22% over the same time. “We are beginning to see some hopeful and encouraging signs,” the governor said. Any plans for reopening must come with expanded testing, an increase in protective gear and intensive care beds at hospitals, and a robust contact tracing operation to track the exposure of other people to someone with COVID-19, Hogan said. The state recently announced it had entered into an agreement with the University of Maryland School of Medicine for an operation that eventually will be able to test up to 20,000 people a day. The governor reminded Marylanders that beginning Saturday, they must cover their faces to go into stores or ride public transportation. He responded to objections ― including from some planning a protest demanding the state reopen its economy ― that the masks infringe on personal liberty. “Spreading this disease infringes on your neighbors’ rights,” Hogan said. The Maryland Department of Health added 788 cases Friday to the state’s tally for a count of 11,572 overall — and another 33 deaths pushed the fatality count to 425. The state included 69 probable deaths in its count, a designation that denotes people who likely died from COVID-19 but the illness has not been confirmed with laboratory testing. Meanwhile, the health department reported 2,612 people have been hospitalized for complications associated with the new virus, a figure that went up by 161 in the last 24 hours.

Coughing on public housing residents a symptom of a broader problem than coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
Let’s all agree that the behavior captured in the latest viral video to make it out of Baltimore — a relatively brief snippet posted on Instagram showing a city police officer who appears to deliberately cough on at least two public housing residents — is indefensible, particularly under the current circumstances. Baltimore and the nation are under a serious COVID-19 outbreak, perhaps the single worst health scare of our lifetimes, and a police officer has no business acting in such a manner. Whether he was joking or actually intended to scare the Perkins Homes residents or not is beside the point. Commissioner Michael Harrison has already described the officer’s actions as both “disturbing” and “incomprehensible.” That sounds about right. As he further noted in his official statement, “the video is alarming because this pandemic is affecting lives not only nationally, worldwide, but right here in our own police department.” But let us also add a few caveats. First, we don’t know the full context here and look forward to the results of the department’s internal investigation. Second, the profanity-laced response of the onlookers isn’t exactly warm, friendly, gracious and supportive either. Not to mention one person spews the ridiculous myth that African Americans can’t get COVID-19, which is disproportionately hitting that group in many cities. That’s certainly not to excuse the officer’s behavior, but some context is important. How much verbal abuse does a patrol officer face walking the beat just a few blocks from Harbor East and Fells Point? And how much do officers invite it? Are patrol officers invested in the Perkins Home community, in the welfare of the people who live there, or do they regard their job like an occupying military force, spurred into action only when a threat to their own well-being is detected? We ask these questions because we strongly suspect that city police officers aren’t coughing on city residents in great number. And, further, you don’t have to work especially hard to find many examples of irresponsible personal behavior during the coronavirus outbreak whether you are looking in Canton where young people seeking booze and restaurant carryout may have to be shooed off the sidewalk or others are similarly violating Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home executive order (as police statewide have investigated more than 1,000 times as of Tuesday). And there’s the “important” people acting irresponsibly like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp reopening the beaches in his state or a certain right-leaning TV news network cavalierly dismissing public health concerns as overwrought and political until the pandemic grew too large and too deadly to ignore. What’s really troubling about the video is not just that one police officer used poor judgement, but that the incident may represent a mere symptom of the broader problem of a wholly dysfunctional relationship between city police and some of the communities they serve. If city residents distrust police and police have little empathy for city residents, what hope is there that violent crime can actually be reduced? And we further have to acknowledge an element of race, culture and class differences in this standoff. The police officer in the video is white, the residents are black. And we wouldn’t be shocked to discover he lives far away from the streets he patrols. It’s not exactly surprising that they aren’t communicating well. Yet enough is enough. We need to heal wounds exacerbated by Freddie Gray’s death. We need to overcome distrust and improve our outreach, discover our common ground. It’s all very well to admonish this officer. He likely deserves it. But what about all the other officers who, while they might refrain from coughing, are perhaps just as uninterested in reaching out to the people who live in public housing? The failure of police and local residents to be on the same page, to respect each other, to look out for each other, is surely as deadly as any virus. There is no vaccine for mutual distrust. Baltimore is suffering its own epidemic. There have been 75 homicides so far this year compared to 71 at this point last year which itself was an unusually deadly year. That compares to the slightly more than 100 deaths so far from coronavrius that have prompted dramatic actions these past several weeks. The city homicide rate won’t be reduced by coughing less or wearing face masks or other protective gear. What is needed, desperately, is for the kind of community policing Commissioner Harrison has been promising since he started the job, for treating murder like a public health crisis, attacking its root causes and healing the rift between city residents and their police department. Only then will there be hope for a cure.

Baltimore-area governments are weighing big cuts as they brace for a collapse in revenues due to coronavirus
.W
A month ago, Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. took the best budget projections available and submitted a spending proposal that anticipated revenues falling. It scaled back plans to hire new teachers, update county senior centers and build new athletic fields. Now, those projections have — in the words of one council member — “collapsed” as government has shut down business activity to contain the coronavirus. The county is facing the possibility that revenues could fall by $270 million by the end of the next budget year, which could force officials to consider eliminating raises and extra school funding. Baltimore County exemplifies the unprecedented fiscal challenge facing counties and cities as coronavirus has shut down the U.S. economy. There could be “some pretty serious impacts” on operations such as public safety and other services because of the pandemic’s “significant disruption” to local economies, said Teryn Zmuda, chief economist for the National Association of Counties. Maryland has been under a stay-at-home order for a month. The state is expecting a loss of $2.8 billion in revenue by June 30 due to business closures and other economic drivers. Already, local governments have initiated cost-saving efforts in anticipation of falling revenues. Government hiring freezes are underway in Baltimore City and neighboring Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Howard, and Carroll counties. Baltimore City and Howard and Carroll counties have also limited nonessential purchases in an effort to limit expenses. The city and Carroll County postponed annual tax sales. And Harford County cut 25% of its anticipated parks and recreation projects, including plans for the Aberdeen Activity Center. At the same time, local governments are spending millions of dollars in general funds and grants to provide emergency pay and protective equipment to employees in public safety, first-response services and food distribution. Baltimore City and Baltimore County have both spent $20 million on COVID-related expenditures, and the city expects that figure to increase to $48 million by June. Howard has spent $4 million in COVID expenses, and Harford has spent $2.5 million. “We’re feeling the impact on both sides, revenues and expenditures, and we’re not alone in facing a much more challenging outlook than we could have anticipated at the beginning of this year,” said Holly Sun, Howard County’s budget administrator. “We know this is going to stress our finances, but we are working to minimize severe actions and ensure our core services are supported.” As he released his budget proposal Friday, Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman said revenue projections have declined by $63 million just since March 13. The Democrat said his $1.7 billion spending plan for fiscal 2021 doesn’t include merit or cost-of-living raises, except for union workers with contracts negotiated before the pandemic. The county will pay all employees a one-time supplement of $1,500, he said. “A budget in uncertain times is a path. This budget is a difficult path. It required us to make some tough choices at the outset,” Pittman said. He said the county is not able to fund new public safety positions, but will fill vacancies. He has frozen hiring for most other county offices, and the county’s public works and fire departments will see cuts in funding for heavy equipment purchases. Baltimore City says employees could face pay cuts, furloughs and layoffs. Several members of the Baltimore County Council, Democrats and Republicans, say it’s better to consider cuts now rather than later. Local leaders say it’s unknown how hard the pandemic will hit government finances in the long run. But it’s bearing down on communities 12 years after the last test during the Great Recession. To weather the last recession, cities were most likely to institute hiring freezes, layoffs, and delays or cancellations of infrastructure projects to balance budgets and cover shortfalls, according to National League of Cities data. Cities tapped reserve funds to weather revenue declines from sales, property and income taxes. Some cities increased fees for services to raise money. And the budget impacts of the last recession went on for several years. More than 40% of cities cut services, such as public works, libraries and parks and recreation programs in 2010 and 2011. There were no significant local government job losses in Maryland during the recession, said Daraius Irani, an economist who is vice president of Towson University’s division of strategic partnerships and applied research. But, there was a hiring freeze that stopped “a long period of expansion for local government" statewide and in Baltimore’s metro area. Some counties did enact furloughs or other pay reductions during the recession, said Michael Sanderson, executive director of the Maryland Association of Counties. Carroll County used layoffs, attrition and retirements to reduce its workforce by 12% in 2009, creating longer wait times for inspections and permits and reduced hours at community centers. It’s unclear when the state might lift coronavirus-related restrictions, making local government budget forecasts more difficult. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has outlined a three-stage plan to reopen businesses, but it would occur only after the state sees two weeks of decreased numbers of hospitalizations, use of intensive-care units and deaths due to the coronavirus. Maryland’s confirmed number of cases exceeds 20,000, and the state’s cumulative death toll from the pandemic is more than 1,000. The most important thing local governments can do now is continue to consider their residents at risk of being hit hardest, such as the elderly, poor, African Americans and Latinos, said Christy McFarland, director of research for the National League of Cities. Those communities will require assistance once moratoriums on water, power and other utility bills are lifted when the economy reopens, she said, “because it’s not going to reopen the same for everybody.” Local governments have expressed hope Congress will approve more aid and that the federal government will reimburse them for pandemic expenses. But Baltimore County officials like Wade Kach, a Cockeysville Republican, say they shouldn’t delay tough budget decisions until then. “I don’t think we can sit back and count on the federal government to bail us out,” Kach said. Baltimore Sun reporter Alison Knezevich contributed to this article.

Amid coronavirus delays, Orioles and Major League Baseball ought to reconsider their ticket refund policy | READER COMMENTARY
.W
I am deeply grateful to the many leaders in our city and state who are working together to ensure that families and businesses stay healthy and financially whole during this crisis. There is one entity, however, that has an opportunity to put much-needed funds into the hands of local communities. That would be Major League Baseball and the Baltimore Orioles (“Orioles, other MLB teams to donate $1 million each in support of ballpark employees during coronavirus delay,” March 17). I purchased tickets for the March 28 Orioles game against the Yankees from StubHub as soon as online ticket sales opened in January, as the Orioles do not do direct online ticket sales anymore (which is a problem for another day). The cost — over $400 — has already cleared my credit card and checking account, which ordinarily wouldn’t be a big deal. But things have changed, and $400 is a lot of money at a time when, as a small business owner, my finances are suddenly different than two months ago. The game is not happening. Last week, MLB announced a two-week delay to Opening Day and this week announced that opening day would be pushed back even further, but gave no specific date. I contacted StubHub to ask for a refund, but apparently MLB has not “officially” canceled the game so I cannot get my money back because the tickets are still valid. Baseball games are often rescheduled when weather forces a cancellation and fans can get tickets to the “same” game played on the new date. Perhaps, Major League Baseball will find a way to ensure all games are technically played via doubleheaders and other scheduling fixes, but the fans who, like me, support their team so much that they set the calendar to buy early season tickets before they sold out are now panicking about paying bills and the money spent on tickets could be used, right now, to meet immediate needs and shop at local businesses like grocery stores. This is not a normal season, and who knows how many Orioles fans in the area have money tied up in these tickets to games that will never happen. MLB and the Orioles should do the right thing and immediately offer to refund all ticket sales for games that are affected by the delay, regardless of whatever make-up schedule is made. God willing, we will have baseball this year and the fans will appreciate getting their money back when they needed it.

Harford schoolchildren still get meals, even as schools are closed during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Bit by bit, whether on foot or in a vehicle, people came into the parking lot at Edgewood Elementary School to pick up a package of three meals, enough to keep children nourished through the next morning as schools remain closed throughout Maryland during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Edgewood Elementary is one of 17 sites where Harford County Public Schools food and nutrition staff have, since Tuesday, been distributing free meals to families so children who would normally get breakfast or lunch at school can still have access to meals. Kristen Sudzina, assistant supervisor for food and nutrition services, noted that the situation with COVID-19 is “always evolving,” and school system officials are working with school administrators and community partners to find more distribution sites. “It’s always changing, so we’re always looking and trying to reach as many children as possible,” she said. School system staff have been preparing hundreds of meal packets each day at locations such as Aberdeen and Edgewood high schools. The packets include breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack — people can get lunch and dinner for the day they pick up the packets and breakfast for the next morning, according to HCPS officials. The kitchen at the rear of Edgewood High was a hub of activity late Thursday morning as staffers put the meal packages in large coolers and loaded them into vans headed to various distribution sites. Staffers, working in teams of two, would spend two hours at the sites, handing out the packages. Daren Zeller, area specialist for food and nutrition, said the staffers in the field are “our true heroes.” He said the families receiving the meals are “just full of smiles and very thankful, and it makes it all worth it.” The distribution system is being operated through HCPS’ Summer Food Service Program; children ages 2 to 18 are eligible to receive the meals. Students must be present when families go to the distribution sites, in accordance with federal regulations, according to HCPS Superintendent Sean Bulson. “As long as we see the students, we can give that food out, so we’re hoping people can keep getting out there,” he said. Staff delivered 1,159 meal packages around Harford County Wednesday — 100 packages, or 300 meals, were distributed at Edgewood Elementary that day, and 125 packages had been prepared for the site Thursday, according to Sudzina. Parent Daryl Philips drove up to the Edgewood Elementary distribution point Thursday morning. He said the meal program is “a big help,” especially since the Harford County school bus driver is currently out of work. “I think it’s a good idea,” the Edgewood resident said. “The kids still need to eat.” Philips’ children attend Joppatowne Elementary School, Magnolia Elementary and Magnolia Middle School. He said they received packets of homework during their last day of school March 13. “They do their work, then we do family stuff,” he said of how the children are using their time while off from school. Tony Jones walked up with his 13-year-old nephew, Dayon Blackston, who attends Edgewood Middle School. Jones, who has two children of his own, said his nephew has spent time at home or seeing his friends and doing activities such as visiting the local skate park. “They’re in the house all day so you need to feed them, and he’s a growing boy so he needs about five, six meals a day,” Jones joked about his nephew. Jones also praised the meals program, as he has been laid off from his job as a carpet installer during the pandemic. “I’m just happy that somebody cares. Somebody cares about these kids,” he said. Food and nutrition staffers Terese Brown and Leah Miller, who work in the cafeterias at Edgewood High School and Magnolia Middle School, respectively, were on duty at the Edgewood Elementary site Thursday. They greeted the recipients and spoke with them briefly as they handed them packages, one per child. “It’s great,” Brown said of the program. “It’s been fun, too, getting to know a lot of people.” Miller said “it’s just encouraging” to see how much people appreciate the meals, and she has been getting to know the children as they and their families come back each day. “It makes you feel good, just to know they’re getting their meals and eating, getting three nutritious meals a day,” she said. The meals have been made up of food and drinks that were available on site at Harford County’s 54 schools, as well as its warehouse, and the school system is working with its vendors to create meals with a mix of sandwich meats, cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables. “Our goal is to ensure we’re providing a nutritious, well-balanced meal to our children,” Sudzina said. “Thad’s our mission, that’s our goal [in Food & Nutrition Services], and we continue with that practice even with this [delivery] service.” Harford County meal distribution sites Here are locations where meals will be distributed, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. unless otherwise noted: Aberdeen Middle School — 111 Mt.

‘Ask the actual source’: Union Bridge woman goes online to teach about dairy farming, with schools closed by coronavirus
.W
A Union Bridge dairy farmer has switched to a digital format to teach others and answer questions about the dairy farming industry during the widespread closures and cancellations forced by the coronavirus known as COVID-19. Katie Dotterer-Pyle, owner of Cow Comfort Inn Dairy in Union Bridge, held a public virtual tour March 20. On the virtual tour, Dotterer-Pyle discussed topics such as how cows are milked, why calves are housed in a calf barn, there not being a food shortage, and even the importance of poop, according to a post on her Facebook page. Dotterer-Pyle decided to do a virtual tour to provide educational information while students are stuck at home with schools closed as the coronavirus spreads in Maryland. “Everybody is stuck at home and, if they’re an extrovert like me, going completely insane,” Dotterer-Pyle said in an interview March 19. “So I love to interact with people, I love to connect with people, especially people that want to learn, like actually want to understand where their food comes from. So I’m just like, ‘You know what? Let’s offer this to the public.’ A lot of kids are home from school, they can ask me live questions as we go through the farm tour.” The public virtual tour was broadcasted live for free on www.facebook.com/cowcomfortinn/. Educating people on the dairy farming industry is important to Dotterer-Pyle because of the amount of farmers in the United States and what she described as misinformation that propagates on social media. “Farmers are less than 2% of the population, so, that being said, we have a lot of people that are removed from agriculture, and they don’t necessarily understand what goes on on a farm every day. Because we’re such a small percentage ... with social media and us farmers are out there on social media, but because they’re such a small portion of us, we don’t have the platform, the money or the big voice, like anti-animal or anti-agricultural people do,” Dotterer-Pyle said. “I get attacked by activists all the time, I have received death threats in the past by these people that have this alternate story of what we do, but yet they’ve never stepped foot on a dairy farm. So I want people to see the reason I do this, and the reason it’s important is for people to see an actual dairy farm, actual people doing the work every day.” Dotterer-Pyle finds it important to give people reliable, first-hand information from a dairy farmer. “My hashtag is pretty popular, I actually do sell shirts with it on too, but it’s ‘#AskFarmersNotGoogle.’ Google has never milked a cow, right? We’re the ones that rise and shine every single day to do this,” Dotterer-Pyle said. “So ask us your questions. We get it, consumers have questions, and I would too if I didn’t grow up on a farm, but please make sure that you’re asking a credible source and not Google and not your mommy blogger friend who, again, might buy milk but she’s never taught a dairy farm. You need to ask the actual source.” Virtual tours aren’t a new thing to Dotterer-Pyle; she started doing them about three years ago. She said she started doing them out of her love to educate others. Due to the coronavirus, Dotterer-Pyle had to change her plans for teaching two McDaniel College environmental studies classes. Those classes will be taught remotely only to McDaniel students next week, on March 26 at 11:30 a.m. and on March 27 and 2 p.m. The college announced March 17 that all instruction for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester will move online after spring break. Dotterer-Pyle said those classes will cover the environmental impacts and the sustainability story of the dairy farm. “With the McDaniel tours, I will focus more and specifically on environmental practices. So, one of those is going to be recycling, dairy farmers recycle so many things,” she said. “Just for example, we recycle manure here. We recycle our cow poop, so we actually take our cow poo, we separate it so it goes through what we call separator so it separates all the water. So we’re left with what we call the fiber or solids of the manure and we dry that out for a dry, fluffy consistency.”

Mount Airy nursing home where one is dead in coronavirus outbreak rated ‘much below average’ by Medicare
.W
The Mount Airy nursing home where a man in his 90s died as a result of an outbreak of the new coronavirus received the lowest rating possible from Medicare, largely due to staffing. The man died Saturday night at the Pleasant View Nursing Home, the same night state and Carroll County officials announced the outbreak there, which has sent 17 others to two local hospitals and resulted in 66 positive tests for the virus among residents. Carroll County officials said all residents of the 104-bed comprehensive care facility have been tested, as well as any staff members with symptoms. The man who died had “a lot of underlying health conditions,” Carroll County Health Officer Ed Singer said at a news conference in Westminster on Sunday. Some of the residents who tested positive did not show any symptoms, he added. As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the nation, outbreaks in retirement communities and nursing homes are of particular concern because people over 60 and those with underlying health conditions are at greater risk for developing serious and life-threatening complications from the resulting COVID-19 illness. One of the first such outbreaks killed 35 residents in a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, Washington. Professor Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar in the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the Mount Airy outbreak was deeply worrisome. “Long-term care facilities house people who are the most vulnerable to severe illness and death from infection with this virus,” Nuzzo said. “Were there to be more outbreaks like this, it could easily overwhelm local health facilities that will have to treat these patients.” At least 11 Pleasant View Nursing Home residents needing a higher level of medical care were taken to Carroll Hospital Center on Saturday and six more were taken Sunday to Frederick Health Hospital, Singer said. He said the facility had been following proper guidelines before the outbreak. “To the best of our knowledge, the facility was doing everything they were supposed to be doing,” Singer said. Carroll County health officials visited the facility on Baltimore National Pike after learning Friday that two residents tested positive, he said. Pleasant View Nursing Home of Mt. Airy received a “much below average," one-star rating from Medicare in its Nursing Home Compare tool. It received “below average,” two-star ratings on its health inspection and quality of care. But its rating was dragged down by a one-star rating for staffing. It appears that Pleasant View relied more on nursing aides to care for residents than other Maryland nursing homes and less on registered or licensed nurses. J. Tod Fetherling, CEO of Perception Health, a Tennessee-based health data firm said the five-star Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility scale is designed to offer a "snapshot of the quality of the facility at that point in time.” These scores are “at the core” of promoting a safe environment for both workers and residents, he said. “With the COVID-19 virus spreading rapidly, quality ratings are important to understand how well facilities are managing their overall quality of services,” Fetherling said. No one answered at a phone number listed for the facility Sunday afternoon. Earlier in the day, media were turned away, and state police said any trespassers would be charged. At a number listed for Douglas and Vicki Tabler, who are trustees for the owner of the 37-acre Pleasant View property on the state’s property website, a person who answered said the Tablers were not available and hung up when the caller identified themselves as a reporter. Pleasant View Nursing Home was incorporated in 1972 and Douglas Tabler acquired the property in 1994, according to state records. Tabler is listed as the agent for the for-profit business in state corporate records. The nursing home provides a variety of care services, including respite, palliative, skilled nursing, long-term and hospice, according to its website. It averages about 100 patients and most of them rely on Medicare or Medicaid, according to state and federal records. Rebecca Travels, administrator of the facility, said Saturday night that facility staff had taken additional measures to limit the spread of the disease, including restricting visits, group dining and activities, performing extra cleanings, and testing staff and residents. “We will continue to work tirelessly, day and night, for as long as we need to in order to prevent further spread and to take really good care of the residents that we have here,” Travels said previously. Since the outbreak, the facility has been following necessary federal and state protocols, including isolating residents with symptoms and screening staff as they come to work. Staff are now required to wear full protective gear, including face masks, gowns and gloves. The county had provided additional face shields, masks, and gowns, Singer said. Singer said health officials are still waiting for more test results of residents and symptomatic staff. The first two residents who tested positive at the facility were tested by private labs and the results were not available for five or six days, Singer said. After those tests came back positive, additional testing by the state lab began immediately and the 64 additional positive cases were returned in about a day on Saturday, Singer said. Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore City health commissioner and professor at George Washington University, said the state needs “far more testing so that early cases can be identified and infected patients can be isolated and treated.” She said nursing homes and their residents are a high risk for COVID-19 and severe illness as a result. She said they follow guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to restrict visitations and cancel group events such as communal dining. As Pleasant View copes with the outbreak, it’s also experiencing a staff shortage. “We’re also trying to assist this facility because they are struggling because some of their staff haven’t been able to report,” Singer said. “They’ve been struggling to be able to do their administration and to be able to staff and be able to take care of their patients.” Singer said it was unclear exactly why some staff haven’t reported. He said some employees might be experiencing symptoms and taking precautions by staying home. He also said some employees are likely scared and reluctant to come to work. “Personally I think there’s a lot of fear,” he said. County officials have been reaching out to the state for additional resources and temporary help agencies to deal with staffing shortages. Carroll Hospital President Leslie Simmons said the hospital has been providing staff support, supplies, “anything necessary to try to help them provide the care as well as prepare ourselves for any influx of patients.” She urged residents to continue to stay home to prevent the further spread of the disease. Carroll County Board of Commissioners President Stephen Wantz also asked residents to continue to stay home. “You have got to make sure you are doing your social distancing,” he said. “I’ve had reports from around the county, from some of our bigger box stores where aisles were packed with people," he said. “I’m just not sure what folks are not understanding about this deadly pandemic. You’ve got to make sure you are protecting not only yourself but when you go home, your family.” Mount Airy Mayor Pat Rockinberg said he’s confident in the “swift and strategic response taken to address the outbreak at Pleasant View Nursing Home." He said the town has taken steps to protect its residents, including commissioning an emergency response team to address closures and other safety measures and to focus on community outreach “to ensure we reach our more vulnerable senior community.” Baltimore Sun reporter McKenna Oxenden contributed to this article.

Doctors, health care workers don’t have enough protective gear to keep them safe from coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
In China, over 3,300 health care workers were infected with COVID-19 during the height of the crisis. As of March 19, in Italy, where COVID-19 infections and deaths continue to soar and health care professionals have been working around the clock, over 3,500 health care workers have become infected and some have died. What will our numbers of infected health care workers in the United States and Maryland be? In Maryland, the first case of COVID-19 in a child has been diagnosed and, as of this writing Friday, there were 149 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with reported cases increasing daily as more testing kits become available and community spread is occurring. According to the Maryland Department of Health, people concerned they may have symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should call their doctor or emergency department before they seek care. Will their doctors be ready to see what is expected to be a steep rise in ill patients over upcoming weeks? The media has covered both disruption of the global supply chain and inappropriate stockpiling of personal protective equipment by the public that jeopardizes the supply of protective equipment in American hospitals and emergency departments. Much less attention has been given to the lack of protective equipment available in primary care settings where most people access health care and where less ill patients may be directed to seek care, so that emergency departments and hospitals are not overwhelmed. The Maryland Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics represents over 1,100 pediatric health care providers in our state. Pediatric practices in many counties in Maryland are sounding the alarm that they are dangerously short of protective equipment. Not only do they lack respirators and protective eye shields, but also basic surgical masks and protective gowns. Critically, this lack of protective equipment leaves providers and their staff at risk, potentially also increasing the spread of COVID-19 to other patients. Without surgical masks, they cannot control spread of COVID-19 in patients and family members who present to their practices with respiratory symptoms. We commend the aggressive and timely campaign that Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration has launched against COVID-19 that protects children and our communities, including school closures and school meal accommodations, and the tireless work that the Maryland Department of Health and Maryland Emergency Management Agency is doing to protect our citizens. The expansion of childcare services for emergency health workers will also make it easier for pediatricians and their staff to operate at full capacity. We now urge our state leaders to work with the federal government to release increased amounts of protective gear from the Strategic National Stockpile to Maryland to be distributed to local health departments, which can then distribute protective gear to ambulatory health care providers according to their disaster preparedness protocols. The federal government should be transparent with health care providers about realistic release of this gear from the stockpile so that practices and public health leaders can plan accordingly. We appreciate the federal government’s  recent invocation of  the Defense Production Act to begin production of protective equipment and hope it quickly reaches those in need. In the interim, we urge any citizens and businesses, such as construction or landscaping, which may have purchased protective gear for their personal or professional use, who are well and not in need, to check if their doctors or health department are accepting donations. Together we will fight this crisis, but we cannot continue to leave our health care workers ill-equipped on the front lines, and their patients inadequately protected. Recent data from a study of COVID-19 infections in children in China, published online in the journal Pediatrics on March 17th, showed that while children are less likely to become severely ill from COVID-19 than adults, there are subpopulations of children who may be at risk for significant disease. Children will also need to be seen in their medical homes for urgent visits unrelated to COVID-19 and for necessary immunizations. All pediatricians need to be prepared and protected to maintain a safe medical home. Immediate increased access to protective gear is critical to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and protect those on whom we depend to take care of our children and families. Dr. Maria Brown (mkbrown@aap.net)is president of the Maryland Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Richard Lichenstein (rlichenstein@som.umaryland.edu) is chair of the disaster preparedness committee, and Dr. Susan Lipton (slipton@lifebridgehealth.org) is chair of the infectious disease committee.

‘People need to eat’: Making sense of why some Maryland farmers markets are open during the coronavirus pandemic
.W
Most Saturdays, Laurel and Andre Mendes leave their home in Hampden — she in her wheelchair and he on foot — to make the mile-long trek to the 32nd Street Farmers Market and stock up on fresh produce. “The market is one of the great joys of living in Baltimore,” Laurel Mendes, 60, said. “After I moved here in 2003, it gave me an anchor to this city. I grew up in California, so having access to fresh produce every day is absolute life for me.” Mendes finds it easier to maneuver between stalls in the year-round, outdoor market than through narrow grocery store aisles. On some trips, she helps out a homebound neighbor by exchanging federal vouchers for food. The market accepts these coupons; the nearest grocery store does not. “Farmers markets are a critical resource for so many people,” Mendes said. As Maryland struggles to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, some of the 107 markets listed in the 2020 Maryland Farmers Market Directory are open — the Saturday morning 32nd Street Market among them. Others — such as the Baltimore Farmers Market beneath the Jones Falls Expressway — are not. The popular downtown market had been scheduled to begin its season Sunday. But the 2020 launch was postponed to an as yet undetermined date by the Baltimore Office of Promotions and the Arts. The usual Sunday market "straddles the line between being a mini-festival and a food store,” said Tracy Baskerville, communications director for the promotions office. “In addition to the farmers, there are food vendors and artists selling their wares. We get 5,000 visitors on an average Sunday, and more during the peak season. We’re looking to see if we might open a bit later in a slightly different capacity.” The recent flurry of new restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in confusion among Maryland residents and business owners who want to follow Gov. Larry Hogan’s safety orders but aren’t always sure how to interpret them. That’s especially true for outdoor markets, which traditionally have attracted large and relaxed crowds. Visitors can often chat with neighbors, try a new cuisine and listen to live music while buying locally grown fruits and vegetables. Some residents have called their local police departments to report markets that the residents thought were violating the governor’s prohibitions of gatherings of more than 10 people, according to Juliet Glass, external relations manager for the Maryland Farmers Market Association, a trade group. Other markets were temporarily shuttered by the municipalities in which they’re located. For instance, the Chestertown Farmers Market was ordered closed by town officials from March 16 to May 15 in an effort to safeguard public health. A hearing on whether to restore the market’s permit is scheduled for Monday. “People need to eat,” said Julie King, who operates the Chestertown market. “We have vendors who rely on these markets for their entire incomes. I honestly believe we can put protocols into place that will help keep people safe, and that our vendors and residents would be super-receptive to them.” The disagreement about whether outdoor markets represent more benefits than risks is not confined to Maryland. On March 30, Los Angeles shut down its markets —but two days later allowed some to re-open. On April 1, the New York Times ran an article headlined, “Why Outdoor Farmers Markets Matter More Than Ever.” The law in Maryland is straightforward: food markets, like grocery stores, are considered to be essential businesses and are allowed to continue operating. “We view farmers markets as similar to the way we view grocery stores,“ said Jason Schellhardt, director of communications for the Maryland Department of Agriculture. “Especially for people who get SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits, farmers markets are a really important source of fresh vegetables and produce. “However, the markets should be implementing social distancing and deep cleaning and generally taking every precaution they can to mitigate the possibility of contamination.“ Glass said her 40 members are making every effort to comply with new safety requirements. “The first thing that went away are the big bins of fruits and vegetables that people were rifling through,” she said. “The tents are spaced out more. A lot of farmers are are taking pre-orders so customers can just pick up their vegetables and leave. Many farmers are doing touchless payments.” She thinks it’s not just vendors but the public who are having to rethink the farmers market experience. “People have always liked outdoor markets because they provide a more enjoyable shopping environment,” she said. “You’re outside and you see your friends. But you can’t do that anymore. You have to go alone or with one family member, do your shopping and leave. Treat it like a surgical strike.”

Maryland primary moves to June amid coronavirus pandemic; voters to pick Cummings’ replacement by mail in April
.W
Maryland is postponing its April 28 primary to June 2 and shifting the special Baltimore-area congressional election to mail-in ballots only — all part of an effort to allow citizens to vote without jeopardizing their health during the coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Larry Hogan issued a proclamation Tuesday to move the date of the statewide primary, which includes the Baltimore mayor’s race, U.S. House contests and the presidential primary. Early voting will begin May 21 and run through May 28. Four other states — Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana and Ohio — also postponed their presidential primaries because of the outbreak. “I have two main priorities — keeping Marylanders safe and protecting their constitutional right to vote,” Hogan said at a news conference in Annapolis. Hogan directed the State Board of Elections to develop a plan by April 3 to carry out the primary that addresses people’s concerns about the election and about preventing the further spread of the disease. Meanwhile, a special election in the 7th Congressional District will be held using absentee ballots only. It is to fill the seat of the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat who represented parts of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County. “While there are many valid reasons for unease and uncertainty right now, ensuring that the voices of Maryland citizens are heard shouldn’t be one of them,” the governor said. The board said in a statement that it was working to carry out the governor’s order. “Our highest priority is to deliver a safe election environment for voters and election workers while also ensuring the fundamental right to vote,” it said. “The actions announced today are critical to fulfilling that goal.” Maryland allows citizens to vote by absentee ballots without any justification, but the state has never tried a mail-only ballot system. Hogan said the board could not get mail-in ballots for the whole state prepared in time for April 28, but that it could be done for the one congressional district. “It is imperative that the people of the 7th Congressional District have a voice in the House of Representatives and that Maryland has a full delegation representing our state in Congress,” the governor said. Former Democratic U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume is running against Republican Kimberly Klacik in the special general election in the 7th District. The winner will fill the rest of Cummings’ term, which ends next January. The state elections board said it will mail absentee ballots to all eligible 7th District voters starting later this month. Voters returning ballots with their choice must have them postmarked on or before April 28. For the June primary, the board said it was working with local elections boards to determine which regular polling places, including those at senior centers, will be available on the later date. Health experts have said older people are more vulnerable to the COVID-19 illness. Candidates in Baltimore’s crowded Democratic mayoral field responded positively to the change in plans, while acknowledging they’ll have to modify spending plans and strategies. Former state Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah called the governor’s decision “wise,” noting local leaders have a lot to focus on beyond politics. Mayoral candidate T.J. Smith said he agreed with Hogan’s decision to postpone the primary, even if it made his campaign a little more difficult. “It does us no good if we have an election and people are marginalized through no fault of their own,” he said. “This is probably the most prudent thing to do.” Mayoral candidate Mary Miller said the election "is too important to rush the process. I applaud Governor Hogan for ensuring access to the ballot for all Maryland voters.” "Postponing the election will allow the governor and our state and local officials the time and resources needed to focus full-time on the response to COVID-19,” said Miller, a former U.S. Treasury official. Hogan previously declared a “state of emergency” in Maryland due to the coronavirus, which had dozens of confirmed cases in the state by Tuesday. With that declaration in place, Maryland law allowed the governor to issue a special proclamation to postpone elections and employ alternate voting systems. No legislative approval was necessary. Maryland’s primary also includes nominations for the offices of Baltimore City Council president, city comptroller and council members. The U.S. House primaries include the 7th District, in which a field of candidates — including Mfume, state Sen. Jill P. Carter and Cummings’ widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings — seek the Democratic nomination for a full, two-year term. Carter said the election changes were the right thing to do. “Our priority is the health and well-being of all Marylanders," she said. “We certainly would not want to have people coming out to vote to their peril." When Hogan appeared Tuesday evening on MSNBC’s “MPT Daily," host Chuck Todd asked him if he was open to mail-only ballots for the next election, if that became necessary. Hogan reiterated that the state elections board wasn’t capable of getting a mail-in election for the full slate of races in the April primary, but that for the future, he was "open to all suggestions.” The pandemic already had dramatically changed the mayoral race. State Sen. Mary Washington suspended her campaign Monday to focus on helping residents through the crisis, while other campaigns stopped knocking on doors and holding fundraisers and asked staff to telecommute. Then, pushing the election back several months further roiled the already chaotic election season. For example, candidates already have spent money on literature advertising an April 28 primary. “Every campaign right now is about to flood the printers,” said Marvin James, spokesman for the mayoral campaign of Democratic City Council President Brandon Scott. Smith and his campaign team made decisions for the last two weeks with the possibility of a postponement in mind, the former Baltimore Police Department spokesman said. He said it was fortunate that he had not yet spent money on television ads, and few of his campaign materials, save some banners, have the former primary date on them. Former Democratic Mayor Sheila Dixon said the new date doesn’t change her strategy or messaging. Her campaign already had adapted how it was speaking to residents during the outbreak, she said. The campaign of Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young is still working to assess the new landscape, campaign spokesman Myles Handy said. The mayor held an in-person fundraiser last week, but has since called off such events. “Do we plan on going back up with a full paid media strategy before the election? Yeah. But I can’t tell you when that is,” Handy said. “We’re not really campaigning much right now. We’re really just reminding people to be safe, and we’ll worry about the politics later on, when things are more clear.” Roger E. Hartley, dean of the University of Baltimore’s College of Public Affairs, said the delay will be harder to weather for candidates running grassroots campaigns. They will be unable to keep getting their message out via canvassing and public forums. The candidates with loaded coffers — including Miller, Scott, Vignarajah and Young — could benefit from the extra time by spreading their message to viewers’ screens at home. “It’s really going to advantage people who can raise money and continue to publicize their campaign,” Hartley said. Vignarajah declined to discuss specific changes to campaign strategy but said his campaign is well-resourced. “It’s going to call for creativity and resources,” he said. “We have both.” James said the Scott campaign will keep spreading its message and rolling out policy, albeit in virtual settings. “We just have to now reallocate resources to extend our voter engagement until June,” he said. Dixon said she expected the extended campaign to cause financial strain for all candidates, but the field of candidates needs to remember the greater financial hardship the virus is causing workers and businesses. “We’re going to be sensitive to all of that,” she said. The postponed primary also extends the time current elected officials in the race will be judged on their performance in the health crisis. Young has issued orders aimed at reducing the spread and impact of the coronavirus in Baltimore, including halting evictions and turning recreation centers into food distribution hubs. “If they can do a good job,” Hartley said, “they may show leadership to the public, who will want to keep them around. But if it goes wrong, they will either — legitimately or not legitimately — get all the blame.” Baltimore Sun reporters Jeff Barker, Luke Broadwater and Pamela Wood contributed to this article.

While coronavirus pandemic plays out on larger scale, its impact on sports world still matters | COMMENTARY
.W
The easiest thing to do right now is remind yourself that, during this dangerous and growing coronavirus pandemic, the negative impact on our favorite sports doesn’t amount to much in this crazy, mixed up world. And you would be wrong. Obviously, there is no equivalency between the cancellation of sporting events and the ravages of a life-threatening disease that has already killed thousands around the globe. Everybody knows that and understands the necessity of doing everything possible to slow the spread of the virus, no matter what the economic consequences. That doesn’t mean, however, that those secondary consequences, both human and economic, are of no consequence. The impact of the nationwide shutdown of professional and amateur sports mirrors the shock wave that has reverberated throughout the global economy and sent markets into free fall. The financial crisis also pales in importance to the attempt to protect the lives of millions of people, but no one would deny it still matters. From a Baltimore perspective, even when you think about the magnitude of all of that, it’s still hard to trivialize the damage that a protracted moratorium on large sporting and other big events might do to an already struggling Orioles organization and a strained local economy. The Orioles now are facing the prospect of a shortened home schedule at a time when attendance already is in stark decline. The 2019 season saw a fifth straight drop to a season total for a non-strike year (1,307,807) that hasn’t been lower since the 1970s. Even before the crisis, the prospects for avoiding a sixth straight downturn were not good. The franchise will survive, of course, and the players will get paid. Major League Baseball and the other big professional sports leagues have proven during their various strikes and lockouts that they are well-equipped to weather this kind of economic setback, but Baltimore won’t be so fortunate. Even with the baseball team struggling to attract the kind of crowds that once routinely packed Oriole Park, the Orioles are a consistent driver of business for the bars and restaurants that surround the Camden Yards sports complex throughout the spring and summer months. It remains to be seen how dramatically the crisis affects the horse racing industry, but it now seems very likely that the Triple Crown races will be delayed indefinitely. That situation should become clearer later this week when officials at Churchill Downs are expected to announce the postponement of the Kentucky Derby, which is currently scheduled to be run May 2. Presumably, the Preakness and Belmont Stakes would fall into line behind whatever date is eventually adopted for the Derby, but even if the races are held in, say, mid-to-late summer, there might remain questions about the wisdom of stuffing crowds that average well over six figures into Churchill Downs, Pimlico Race Course and Belmont Park. Everyone knows what the Preakness weekend means to Maryland racing, which supports an estimated 20,000 jobs across the state. The huge crowds that show up at Old Hilltop for Black-eyed Susan Day and the Preakness are the economic underpinning for the entire local industry. Racing will continue at Laurel Park in front of empty stands, but that is much less of an issue on regular race days because in-house crowds are generally small and most betting is now done remotely. The major tracks will feel that more, but fans and bettors can still watch televised races on various betting apps, while fans of the major sports might have to content themselves with rebroadcasts of classic games. Give some credit to the NCAA — which I rarely do — for doing the right thing to lessen the negative impact on the spring sports athletes who have had their seasons cut short. The addition of an additional year of eligibility for seniors will allow those who decide to continue an opportunity to finish their degrees or begin graduate studies. The NCAA announced that it is also considering what to do for winter sports athletes who have lost their conference and national tournaments. That also might involve some eligibility extensions, but it’s sad to see local college basketball stars such as Maryland’s Anthony Cowan Jr. and Kaila Charles unable to make a final run at the Final Four. Couldn’t be helped, but it’s not a small thing, even if it doesn’t compare with everything else going on in the world.

Adoptions at Harford animal shelter remain steady during coronavirus pandemic; nonprofit asks people to refrain from visiting
.W
Adoptions from the Humane Society of Harford County have remained on an “even keel,” over the past few weeks as the new coronavirus has taken hold in Maryland, even as staff has asked people to refrain from visiting the shelter unless they have business there. “[U]nless you are actively seeking to adopt an animal, need to come and reclaim a stray pet, have a donation, or have other urgent business at the shelter, please refrain from visiting the Humane Society of Harford County until restrictions are lifted,” the shelter posted on its Facebook page. “This is to protect the public, including our staff and volunteers. By keeping our staff and volunteers healthy and at full capacity, we can ensure that our animal residents will continue to receive the daily care they require and deserve.” Erin Long, the marketing director for HSHC, said staff has been receiving a lot of questions about whether foster families are needed for animals. “Most of the shelters that folks are seeing on the news and social media are in need of fosters because they’re closing,” she said. “Because we’re still open, we want to keep our animals in the shelter for potential adopters. We may need to shift to taking appointments only, but that will be re-evaluated as we move deeper into the COVID-19 situation.” Like many companies and organizations, the humane society is trying to do as much business as possible over the phone and online, Long said, and trying to limit the number of people coming the shelter, located off Connolly Road in Fallston. “When folks need to come in, we have stations set up at both the adoption desk and the intake desk with hand sanitizer,” she said. “We are first determining what we can help them with to limit foot traffic and asking guests to practice social distancing while in the building.” Fewer volunteers are also coming to the shelter. HSHC has cancelled all training classes for new volunteers and have stopped taking new volunteer applications. “Most of our core team of ‘regulars’ are still coming every day, but those volunteers that came more infrequently are staying away,” Long said. The shelter takes in about 3,000 animals per year and are seeing about eight to nine new animals come in each day. From March 17 through Tuesday, the humane society has taken in 13 animals surrendered by their owners and another 31 brought in by the Harford County Sheriff’s Division of Animal Control. During the same time frame, the shelter has adopted out 13 animals, returned seven lost pets to their owners and sent 10 to rescues, Long said. The daily intake hasn’t increased as a result of COVID-19 spread or worries, but it is increasing naturally with the arrival of several litters of kittens, she said. Kitten season — when a number of female cats give birth to their litters, flooding animal shelters — traditionally lasts from spring through October. HSHC had planned a “Kitten Shower” for April 4 to solicit donations of supplies to help take care of kittens as well as find fosters to the felines, but it has been canceled due to coronavirus concerns. A quarter auction fundraiser scheduled for last weekend was also canceled and, depending on how long state and federal restricts on large gatherings last, could have to cancel other future events — another quarter auction is scheduled for May 9 in Havre de Grace and a June 23 Paint Your Paint night is planned at Alecraft Brewery in Bel Air. People who wish to donate to help out the Humane Society of Harford County can do so online at harfordshelter.org and clicking on “Ways to Give.” Animals will continue to come in to the shelter, both from the public and through animal control, Long said. “Our rescue partners have been very helpful, and are stepping up to take animals into their programs to free space," she said.

Gov. Larry Hogan’s coronavirus leadership trumps Trump’s -and many others | COMMENTARY
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan’s firm action to mitigate the corona virus outbreak in Maryland is being lauded as a model of executive leadership in a time of crisis. The praise is well-deserved, as the scientific evidence makes very clear that the only workable strategy to slow the progression of the virus — and eventually reverse its spread — is to shut down all large gatherings. Not all state governors are so sure-footed in their crisis leadership. While a good many governors also have acted appropriately to the crisis, others have been slow to make decisions to protect the public. The same for city mayors — some have been at the forefront of crisis leadership, others too slow to act. Perhaps the anti-models of good leadership are the governor of Oklahoma tweeting a picture of himself at a restaurant at the height of the crisis, and the mayor of New York City delaying so long that the state governor had to mandate action after the virus spread was already too great. At the essence of the U.S. failure to avert this crisis are a federal system that gives enormous discretion to states and localities in responding to crises, and a presidential administration that has demonstrated neglectful leadership at a time when federal action could have made a big difference. The U.S. federal system to be sure is a remarkable government construct that has largely served as a hallmark of the most stable democratic regime in history. During normal times, the system’s flexibility and adaptability to local values and customs have ensured widespread public respect for government authority and the rule of law. What works well in Maryland may not work in Virginia, and definitely not in Arkansas. And that’s fine. Eleven states legalized marijuana for recreational use, and 39 others have not, although some will come along when they are ready, and others will retain opposition to legalization. It is during crises and emergencies when the virtue of a complex and multi-layered federal system is challenged. States do not act in unison, and cooperation between the national and subnational governments isn’t always effective or even existent in some cases. Take Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which devastated the Gulf Coast states of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama. The states on their own simply were not up to the task of solving the crisis, and yet the federal government response was one of delay, as the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency effectively folded his arms and waited for the state and local governments to respond first. The consequences were severe for the people of those states. The storms that ravaged parts of Texas, Florida and especially Puerto Rico in 2017 again showcased the limits of a federal system in a crisis. States couldn’t do everything needed on their own and the federal response was highly inadequate. Perhaps the most telling episode was the president of the United States lecturing Puerto Rico to do more to solve its own problem, and not to come to the federal government seeking solutions. The Trump administration response to the corona virus outbreak will go in the history books as one of the most colossal failures ever of presidential leadership. The severity of the outbreak could have been averted weeks ago, but the president downplayed it, ignored scientific advice, and that left disaster mitigation to states and localities. Many state and local leaders are making the right decisions to try to get through this crisis. But there is no national coordination and those subnational governments slow to act are endangering everyone. Without some aggressive national action, many will continue to act with less than the urgency required in this situation. Federalism in the U.S. has great virtues during normal times. But in crises and emergencies a sure-handed national effort is necessary. And that is tragically lacking right now. Mark J. Rozell (mrozell@gmu.edu) is dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and co-author of the book Federalism: A Very Short Introduction. He lives in Maryland.

Baltimore’s community organizers battle misinformation and apathy on front lines of coronavirus fight
.W
As Maryland leaders rush to stymie the spread of the new coronavirus pandemic, some of Baltimore’s community organizers have found themselves on the front lines of efforts to combat misinformation and apathy toward the virus. Baltimore community associations typically shoulder hyper-local responsibilities such as filing 311 requests, leading street clean-ups and checking on elderly residents. Lately, some community leaders have added public health education and enforcement to their duties — while also dealing with a shortage of volunteers to assist on crucial projects. One community leader decided to call police last week when he noticed a neighborhood church hosting a large gathering, just a day after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan banned gatherings of more than 50 people. Hogan has since amended the ban to apply to gatherings of more than 10 people. Another community leader said she was disappointed to discover her neighbor was only vaguely aware of the virus that has swept across the world. East Baltimore’s Oliver Community Association president Earl Johnson walked the neighborhood last week, firmly reminding each resident he encountered to practice the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations meant to prevent the spread of infection. “Y’all sitting too close together,” Johnson shouted across the street to a group of five men sitting around a rowhome stoop. “Spread apart.” The men did not move. Johnson said one of the biggest struggles amid the pandemic for the community association has been to dispel false conspiracy theories, specifically one he’s heard repeated multiple times: that black people cannot contract the virus. A majority of Baltimore residents are black. And some Oliver pedestrians were not appearing to follow recommendations of social distancing, a practice of maintaining about 6 feet from others to avoid spreading the virus. “Six feet,” Johnson said to a man who walked down the sidewalk toward him. The man tried to give Johnson a fist bump. Johnson held out an elbow instead. “People don’t know what’s right or true,” Johnson said. “The CDC keeps changing their information. Man, I wish we just had someone who we believe in, who can tell us what to do and how long to prepare. This isn’t a snow day.” Oliver is among several Baltimore neighborhoods taking on the responsibility of educating people, with some associations converting their social media pages into information hubs about COVID-19. And In some cases, Some residents have been reluctant to listen. West Arlington neighborhood organizer Sean Stinnett said he received pushback from residents in Northwest Baltimore when, out of concern for public health, he canceled a clean-up of illegal dumping in the neighborhood. And Mark Washington, the director of the Coldstream Homestead Montebello Community Corp., said a lot of elderly neighbors appear to be sheltering in place — but he’s aggressively warning seniors of several predatory practices associated with the pandemic. Washington directs residents to the community association’s Facebook page for reliable information. Johnson, the Oliver association president, said he reluctantly called police Tuesday to break up a large gathering at a church in the neighborhood. “I feel horrible calling police on them,” he said. “But as they’re going into corner stores to buy food, they’re touching stuff. And then the lady who lives on the corner goes in to buy bread and she touches the same thing. People don’t think.” Police confirmed the incident but said no police report was filed. Cyndi Tensley, president of the Carrollton Ridge Neighborhood Association, said the social distancing recommendation has been her biggest challenge in trying to support amid the pandemic. Tensley has been meaning for years to conduct an unofficial community census to help identify the elderly and other vulnerable residents in the neighborhood. The pandemic arrived before a census could be undertaken, she said. “I’ve been caught, so to speak, with my pants down,” she said. “I don’t want to go door-to-door knocking. I can go to neighbors I know, but I don’t want to be the source of contagion either.” In lieu of making direct contact with residents, Tensley has pored over news coverage of COVID-19 in hopes of keeping up with the latest developments. When she discovered a close neighbor was unaware that President Donald Trump had declared the outbreak a national emergency, she set out to educate the woman on the CDC health directives and referred her to the Carrollton Ridge association’s Facebook page. The page is populated with Baltimore city health directives, information about food assistance, free ways to access the internet and creative ways to explain to children the importance of washing hands. Still, Tensley feels overwhelmed by the pandemic’s sudden arrival in Maryland. “I know I can’t handle it,” Tensley said. “I’m not even trying to fool myself. It’s in the Lord’s hands. You do what you can do.” Meanwhile, Johnson has struggled to keep other neighborhood initiatives afloat. A community meeting last week was converted from an in-person gathering to a conference phone call. And Oliver has two community gardens, which are usually tilled each spring by volunteers from local universities. With many college students sent home for the spring semester, Johnson plans to till the soil himself and scale back the gardens this year. One neighbor, Ross Barnett, offered to continue helping Johnson in the garden this year, despite public health recommendations to avoid contact with people. The 74-year-old wandered around the garden plot last week with his dog Yaya and pointed to the large plumes of kale that have already pushed through the soil. Barnett boasted he is in great health, adding that he starts every morning by doing pushups. “I’ve never been sick a day in my life,” he said. “God’s not coming for me. He’s coming for others.”

Here are the top 5 downloaded books from Maryland libraries as coronavirus forces readers to stay home 
.W
While avid readers are finding “closed” signs on the front doors of area libraries due to the coronavirus pandemic, the long-standing public institution is proving to be just as busy, if not more, as it finds other ways to serve the community. Prominently displayed on the various county public library home webpages, along with the Enoch Pratt Free Library, is a reminder that their digital libraries are open 24/7. Customers are taking full advantage, checking out e-books, audiobooks and e-magazines, while streaming movies, television shows and music, and using other useful tools libraries are providing online. See the Top 5 most downloaded e-books by county below. At Enoch Pratt, anybody can log on to its website to register for a digital library eCard. Spokeswoman Meghan McCorkell said since the physical libraries first closed last month, more than 700 have been issued per week. “From March to April, we’re going to wind up with over 3,000 new library users, so it’s pretty tremendous,” McCorkell said. “We’ve seen a really steep increase in the usage of our digital resources, so we’re excited about that and trying to keep up with demand because we’re also the state library of Maryland providing services across the state. People are really loving video audio books, we’re also providing streaming television shows, streaming movies, streaming music mostly for teenagers. … So we have a bunch of different platforms people can access.” As the state library, Pratt has increased its number of available tutors through the Brainfuse program, a live online tutoring and education portal. “So say your kid is doing sixth grade math and they don’t do sixth grade math now the way you did in school, so you have no idea how to do it,” McCorkell said. “You can log on to our database and your child can get in touch with a live tutor, they then can work with an online blackboard and show children how to do the math problems. They won’t do it for them, they’ll just show them how to work it through until the child is able to understand it. That’s a free service with your library card.” As the communications and media relations director for the Baltimore County Public Library, Erica Palmisano is always encouraging people to read and – during this difficult time – even more. Since the pandemic, she has had a much bigger audience. “I think people are reading more than ever,” Palmisano said. “Reading keeps your mind active. It keeps you from not feeling trapped at home because you’re really visiting another world, another person’s experience while your reading a book. So whether you’re reading a physical book, or an e-book, or listening to an audio book, you really are transported to another place or another time.” In addition to providing digital services and technical tools to stay connected with the community, the Carroll County Library, working in conjunction with the Maryland Makers Unite project, is using its 3-D printers to make parts for protective face shields for health care workers. With 11 branches serving over a million people a year, Harford County Public Library CEO Mary Hastler has her staff already planning for the post-pandemic days, including the exploration of providing Wi-Fi access in the county beyond inside its libraries and parking lots. The future presents many questions. How to handle library materials? Should libraries be open with staggered time or possibly having customers make reservations? Are closed stacks – secure storage areas – an option moving forward with customers requesting materials and employees retrieving them? Should every library branch have drive-thru windows? “So we are coming up with new procedures when we do re-open,” Hastler said. “We’ve got so many exciting things to think about and it really is a real paradigm shift for us as a public library.” Here’s a look at the Top 5 most downloaded ebooks in Baltimore area libraries since Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic: Anne County Public Library 1. American Dirt – Jeanine Cummins 2. Little Fires Everywhere – Celeste Ng 3.

'It’s like changing recipes on the fly’: TV networks adapt to world without live sports amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Scott Van Pelt was supposed to be breaking down the NCAA tournament bracket on a busy Sunday night on ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” Instead, Van Pelt was figuring out how to fill most of the hour with the sports world on hold because of the spread of the coronavirus. “I have no idea. Right now having a rundown is a bit pointless,“ Van Pelt said. “It’s like changing recipes on the fly. Are we making cookies? No, making something entirely different. I don’t know what else can be canceled on our watch. It’s been quite a week.” Van Pelt was supposed to be doing halftime segments during last Wednesday's NBA games. What ended up happening was Van Pelt updating viewers about the NBA season as well as providing interviews and analysis once the game New Orleans Pelicans' game at the Sacramento Kings was postponed. Van Pelt and ESPN weren't the only ones having to scramble to fill programming. CBS aired championship games from past Big Ten and Atlantic 10 tournaments on Saturday and Sunday. During the hour that CBS was supposed to be showing the tournament selections, viewers in New York saw the news while Los Angeles aired an infomercial. NBC and Golf Channel showed the final two rounds of last year's Players Championship after the PGA Tour canceled the final three rounds Friday. Fox left it up to their affiliates to program the gap left by the cancellation of Sunday's NASCAR race in Atlanta and NBCSN re-aired last year's IndyCar season opener. ESPN at least had some live programming on Saturday with a UFC card from Brazil. Sunday was mostly films from the “30 for 30” series while ESPN2 re-aired some of the top college basketball games from the season. On Saturday they showed the entire “Love and Basketball” series. ABC also showed “30 for 30” films as well as a couple of episodes from the “College Football 150” series. FS1 and FS2 had a mix of college basketball and XFL re-airs. Whether that remains the template for future weekends remains to be seen. Van Pelt said the early plan for Sunday's “SportsCenter” included analyzing players approving the NFL's collective bargaining agreement as well as any signings that took place. He was also planning to interview Penn State senior forward Lamar Stevens on seeing his season end abruptly when the Nittany Lions appeared to be headed to March Madness. At first, Van Pelt wondered why the NCAA wouldn’t release a bracket but then saw the reason, saying “it would be like what you would have gotten for Christmas and Christmas is canceled.” Van Pelt is trying not to look ahead because the situation can change on a dime and because it can be an unsettling feeling. He has received texts and calls from friends, family and athletes wondering the same thing as he is — what type of show are they going to do? One thing that Van Pelt is planning on doing is showcasing those who have had their seasons cut short. He sent out a tweet on Friday asking people to nominate high school and college seniors to spotlight. “In the absence of live content, we can do storytelling and acknowledge those who we know are out there that had their season end. There are quite a few people that we can shine a light on,” he said. “Right now I’m just focusing on tonight’s show. We have a lot of smart people who can figure out a lot of different things. I don’t know how anyone can plan for eventualities not knowing what the end game is?”

South Carroll: After couple’s wedding plans nixed by coronavirus closures, Mount Airy boutique steps up
.W
On March 20, Hilary and Alex Chiang celebrated their wedding between them, along with an officiant, at the train station located in the Blossom and Basket Boutique parking lot in Mount Airy. They had to overcome obstacles to become husband and wife during the unexpected health crisis we are experiencing. Rene Bonde Shiffler, one of the owners of Blossom and Basket Boutique, was able to help this couple to celebrate their wedding. Blossom and Basket Boutique is a local business owned by Bonde Shiffler and her mom, Ellie Bonde. They are a full-service flower shop for special events. Bonde Shiffler explained that the couple, Hilary and Alex, have been planning this wedding for many months. They hired Blossom and Basket Boutique to do the floral arrangement for their wedding that was supposed to happen at Antrim 1844 in Taneytown on March 21. “All of the flowers had been ordered, and some were already in my building when we got the call Monday [March 16] afternoon that all restaurants (including their venue) had to close,” Bonde Shiffler said, in reference to the state order that was made in response to the spreading coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. Bonde Shiffler added that after this announcement, she planned on creating most of the flowers as planned, then the bride would pick them up and transport them to her mother’s house across the Bay Bridge, where they would have their 10-person family gathering on March 21. Unfortunately, the couple had a marriage license that was only valid in Carroll County. Because of this, the bride contacted Bonde Shiffler on March 18, asking if the shop was located in Carroll County, and Bonde Shiffler said yes. Then, the bride asked Bonde Shiffler, since they were going to Mount Airy to pick up the flowers March 20 in the afternoon, if they could bring their friend, the officiant, Richard Loube, and do a quick ceremony so that “they would be legal.” Bonde Shiffler said “absolutely” and then, “I verified when they were planning to be at the shop on Friday and we got off the phone.” “I wanted to make it special for them, as I can only imagine how stressful and disheartening it must be to let go of all of the plans you have spent a year preparing for, just a few days prior,” Bonde Shiffler said. “I love love, I love weddings and I wanted to make it as special as I could.” Bonde Shiffler said she and her team set up the display that was intended to be at Antrim on the back porch of the train station that’s in the Blossom and Basket Boutique parking lot. She added that they set up a table in front of the shop so there would be space to display the cake she bought at Safeway, and the sparkling wine they have for their late night shopping events. “When Hilary and Alex got here, and I presented her with her bridal bouquet, and pinned Alex’s boutonniere on him, there were tears of gratitude all around,” Bonde Shiffler said. “I was so excited to be able to share in this special time, and give them a piece of the wedding that they had been planning for so long!” Bonde Shiffler said the couple was very happy with how everything turned out. She also said the couple were able to do their first dance song that they choreographed for their wedding celebration. After the dance, Bonde Shiffler said, they pulled out the cake and champagne, and toasted “to all our new friends!” Bonde Shiffler is very happy that she was able to help this couple celebrate their wedding even though they did not have guests, the venue and everything they have planned. She also added that these are uncertain times and the health crisis has drastically changed her business. According to Bonde Shiffler, she had to reschedule all of her March and April events, and the daily flower shop has temporarily closed operations, but they were working on a way to be open for just delivery and curbside pickup. “We are working via email and over the phone with brides and grooms planning future weddings and events and making sure that once it is safe for us to reopen we will be ready,” Bonde Shiffler said. “Even in times of a health crisis people still have birthdays, anniversaries, new babies are born and people pass away, flowers are usually a part of those celebrations and flowers just make people feel better, and who does not need cheering up now!” She also sends a message to all of the local businesses in our community. She encourages them “to be safe, but be proactive, and continue doing what you are good at! Using technology to keep connected and keep your business in the forefront of people's minds is what I think will carry us through.” For more information about Blossom and Basket Boutique, you may visit their website, https://blossomandbasket.com/. You may also contact Ellie and Rene Bonde at their email, blossomandbasketmanager@gmail.com, to use their services and help our local businesses. Blossom and Basket Boutique is located at 3 N.

Maryland school districts will still feed students in need while closed for coronavirus threat
.W
Several Maryland school districts plan to continue providing meals to students in need as officials try to slow the spread of the new coronavirus with school closures. Public schools across Maryland will be closed two weeks beginning Monday, state education officials announced Thursday. Schools will re-open on March 30. The closures will affect many students — about 100,000 in Baltimore city and county schools alone — who rely on free school meals. Baltimore City Public Schools, which provides free meals to all of its students, will be opening at least eight emergency food distribution sites at “strategically located” schools citywide from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. beginning Monday, said schools CEO Dr. Sonja Santelises. The Baltimore sites, open each day through Friday, include Alexander Hamilton Elementary School, The Historic Cherry Hill Elementary/Middle School, Yorkwood Elementary School, John Ruhrah Elementary/Middle School, Arlington Elementary School, Beechfield Elementary/Middle School, Sinclair Lane Elementary School, and the Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. The meals will be available to students ages 18 and younger, Santelises said. She said the district also will provide these meals to school program participants with disabilities who are older than 18. The meals will be free grab-and-go breakfasts and lunches. The district will work with Baltimore City’s Emergency Food Working Group to identify additional options for food access and distribution for the week of March 23. Nonprofit organizations also are stepping up to provide food to students and residents. Lashawna Spencer, a family service coordinator at the Patterson Park branch of the Dayspring Head Start program, was in Lutherville Friday to gather food from the Baltimore Hunger Project organization. Dayspring Head Start is opening its doors for a few hours and days each week for families to grab nonperishable food and fruits, Spencer said. The program has spent several days advising families to self-quarantine, Spencer said, and her organization wants families to have access to food that’s otherwise difficult to obtain due to lack of transportation and the pandemic itself. “Everybody is kind of freaking out about what life will be like for the next two weeks … but the thing they’re worried about the most is how they’re going to be eating for the next couple of days,” Spencer said. Lynne B. Kahn, founder and executive director of Baltimore Hunger Project, said each week they support 700 children who receive free or reduced lunch from Baltimore city and Baltimore County schools. The organization sends out weekend food packages to students, and Kahn said they’re currently worried about students who may not have food at home during the virus outbreak. Kahn said the group has mobilized volunteers to come by its warehouse to pick up extra food that can be donated to families in need during the outbreak. The organization works directly with 25 schools in the city and the county. Baltimore County Public Schools will provide bagged grab-and-go lunches — a cold sandwich, fruit, juice and milk — from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. each weekday beginning Monday. The meals can be picked up in the parking lots of the locations listed on the district’s website. The Howard County Public School System will provide free grab-and-go items, and meals to anyone younger than age 18, beginning Tuesday. The meals will be available from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at four school sites and five mobile sites through March 27, excluding weekends. Harford County Public Schools will serve meals in communities beginning Tuesday and will do so for the duration of the closures. Details and site locations will be available at the county’s school webpage. Carroll County Public Schools is participating in the Emergency Feeding Program to provide meals to children under age 18 without charge. Food distribution will occur midday Monday through Friday. Individuals must bring their children with them when they walk or drive up to the sites to receive meals. Details are on the district’s website. Anne Arundel County Public Schools will provide students with a curbside pickup of hot lunches at 31 school sites from noon to 12:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Mobile meals vehicles also will deliver meals to 21 additional sites in six communities on weekdays. Each child will be provided one free meal each day. Children must be between the ages of 2 and 18, but do not have to be eligible for free and reduced-price meals. Adults cannot accept meals on behalf of children. Details are online on the district’s website.

Coronavirus: When there aren’t enough ventilators, who will live, who will die? | COMMENTARY
.W
As the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, makes its way across the country and the state, hospitals will become inundated with patients who have the virus. Many of these patients will need intensive care beds and ventilators. Experts predict there will be fewer ventilators available than patients who need them. The question then becomes, how should doctors decide who gets one? Maryland is fortunate in that a framework has already been developed, with public input, to answer that question. In 2013, physicians and bioethicists at Johns Hopkins and the University of Pittsburgh collaborated on a pilot study aimed at developing community-informed criteria for allocating scarce health care resources during disasters. The findings of the study were made publicly available in 2017. The report recommends a triage procedure that hospitals in the state put in place for allocation of ventilators if the governor declares a catastrophic health emergency and orders the secretary of health to put a rationing system in place. The governor declared a catastrophic health emergency on March 5th, but has not yet ordered the use of the rationing system. While some details of the 2017 plan may be modified, the allocation approach was designed to save as many lives as possible and is based primarily on two factors: Likelihood of short-term survival, i.e. the patient with the ventilator support will live long enough to be discharged from the hospital.  Likelihood of long-term (at least 12 months) survival. Patients will be scored, between 1 and 7 points, based on these two components. Short-term survival is based on an adult patient’s sequential organ failure assessment score, which is calculated using certain laboratory values and organ function indicators. Short-term survival for children is based on a similar scoring system called pediatric logistic organ dysfunction. Calculating these formulas is relatively straightforward and involves little discretion. A patient would receive a score of between 1 and 4 for this component. For long-term survival, patients would receive a score of either 0 or 3. In an effort to avoid discrimination against those with disabilities or chronic illnesses that are not life-threatening in the short term, only patients who have underlying conditions that are so serious that they are likely to die within a year would be assigned a score of 3. Such conditions might include end stage heart or lung disease, advanced cancer or severe trauma. Those with the lowest total scores would be given priority. If several patients receive the same score, age could be a “tie-breaker” with children and adults up to age 49 given the highest priority and those over 85 the lowest. “Triage officers” are responsible for calculating the initial score for all patients. These will be individuals from various hospital departments that provide care to critically ill patients. These officers are to work with a “triage team” that the report recommends include an experienced critical care nurse, a clinician familiar with ventilators and a representative from the hospital’s administration. The allocation approach also calls for assessing individuals who are currently on a ventilator who do not have COVID-19. The same method will be used to calculate a score for these individuals as for those with the virus. Individuals in this category raise the challenging possibility of taking someone off the ventilator without their consent who might otherwise live. Because of the ethical concerns surrounding such an act, the report calls for the possibility of an appeal of the triage officer’s decision to a Triage Review Committee, which is “independent of the triage team,” to review the accuracy and fairness of the decision. The implementation of the triage process also triggers legal immunity for the health care providers who act in good faith in pursuit of the triage goals of saving the maximum number of lives possible. We applaud the state of Maryland for having the foresight to plan for this impending health care crisis. We have seen what happened in Italy, where health care providers lacked the advance notice and allocation frameworks to aid in heart-wrenching decisions about whom to treat and whom to let die. We have an advantage right now of time and a community-informed allocation framework to guide decision-making. We need to ensure that hospitals are adequately prepared by having triage systems in place. Applying scores now to patients on ventilators as training for if/when the governor orders the secretary of health to put a rationing system in place could facilitate quick action and save lives. We also urge hospitals, as well as the media and state health officials, to educate the public about the final resource allocation framework adopted by the state, so that patients are not learning about it for the first time upon hospital admission, and to be open and transparent during its implementation.

Havre de Grace leaders note ER delays, prospect of coronavirus in making case to keep Harford Memorial Hospital open 
.W
Havre de Grace’s mayor has written to Gov. Larry Hogan, asking the governor to issue an executive order barring any hospitals in Maryland — including Harford Memorial — from being closed until the coronavirus ourbreak has passed. “Until we are well clear, at least, of any looming virus such as coronavirus, it would be a fool’s move to do such a thing,” Mayor William T. Martin said during a meeting of the City Council Monday evening. The mayor’s request comes as city leaders continue their push against University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health’s plan to close Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace — one of two hospitals the health system operates in Harford County — and open a free-standing medical center in Aberdeen and expand the number of beds at UCH’s second hospital, Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air. Residents, public safety officials and elected leaders in Harford Memorial’s service area, which includes western Cecil County, have protested the proposed closing of the hospital, which has been in downtown Havre de Grace for more than 100 years. Upper Chesapeake Health officials announced their plans to consolidate medical services in Harford County in early 2016. The free-standing medical center, which was initially planned for land the health system owns near the Bulle Rock community in Havre de Grace, will have a full-service emergency room as well as beds for patients staying in the hospital for a short time and multiple other medical services. Officials with UCH also plan to build a psychiatric facility on the Aberdeen campus — the Merritt Properties office property off of Route 22 — where patients can receive inpatient and outpatient mental health services. Beds for medical and surgical patients at Harford Memorial will be consolidated with medical and surgical beds at the Bel Air hospital in a “bed tower” built on top of the Kaufman Cancer Center, according to the project website. More information about the Aberdeen campus is online at the “Your Health. Our Mission” website. The mayor and David Glenn, the City Council president, took issue with the planned consolidation of medical services, though. The mayor cited data Monday showing how often the emergency rooms at Harford Memorial and Upper Chesapeake Medical Center do not have beds available for patients, or patients must be rerouted to other hospitals, because the ERs are dealing with more patients than they can handle with their resources at hand. The data comes from the Maryland Institute of Emergency Medical Services System's County/Hospital Alert Tracking System, or CHATS. The data set Martin showed covered a, eight-month period from July 1, 2019 to Feb. 28, 2020, and the mayor discussed when the Upper Chesapeake ERs were in “yellow alert,” “red alert” or “reroute” status. Yellow alert means emergency department administrators have issued a temporary request that their department “receive absolutely no patients in need of urgent medical care” because of a “temporary overwhelming overload." Red alert means the hospital has no available beds in which medical staff can conduct cardiac monitoring of patients. Reroute means an ambulance unit must be held at an emergency department because hospital beds are not available, according to MIEMSS. Harford Memorial Hospital was on yellow alert 61 times, on red alert 25 times and had to reroute patients 28 times, for a total of 892.44 hours over the eight-month period. Upper Chesapeake Medical Center went to yellow alert 114 times, red alert 25 times and reroute 195 times, for a total of 2,441.45 hours over the same period, according to the MIEMSS data. “This is not a Havre de Grace problem,” Martin said. “This is a Harford County, Cecil County problem.” The mayor noted Upper Chesapeake Medical has had many more alerts and reroutes than Harford Memorial, meaning people who live near the hospital in Bel Air risk being sent to another hospital if their local ER is overwhelmed. “I don’t care if you live in Fallston, Edgewood, Bel Air, this involves everybody,” Martin said. Glenn, the council president, thanked Martin for his letter to the governor. He said he and other council members check CHATS, which is online, on a regular basis, and they can see when hospitals in Harford, and other parts of the state, have red or yellow alerts or must reroute patients. A check of CHATS Tuesday evening showed Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in yellow alert and reroute status. A number of other hospitals in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., region also were on yellow alert, though, such as MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center in Baltimore County, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore City, as well as University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. “What that means is, you have a saturated system,” Glenn said of the alerts. “And what makes a saturated system even worse is when you have an epidemic like coronavirus or the flu.”

Masks sent to Maryland from federal stockpile in coronavirus crisis ’technically past’ suggested shelf life
.W
Face masks delivered to Maryland from national stockpiles were past the recommended use date when cleared for use by the federal government, according to the state Health Department. The masks from the Strategic National Stockpile “were technically past” the manufacturer’s suggested shelf life, department spokesman Charles Gischlar said in an email in response to questions from The Baltimore Sun. Gischlar said the masks — which are in short supply across the country as the coronavirus spreads — were certified for use under a decades-old program in which the U.S. Food & Drug Administration samples drugs, masks and other health and safety tools to determine if they can still be effective. Maryland has received "two waves of Strategic National Stockpile shipments since March 13” totaling 274,000 masks — 191,000 surgical masks and 83,000 N95 masks, Gischlar said. N95 masks filter the air and are sometimes called “respirators.” The masks in the first shipment were past their suggested shelf lives, but were approved for distribution through the federal Shelf-Life Extension Program, or SLEP, Gischlar said. The program is designed “to avoid the need to replace entire stockpiles every few years at significant expense,” according to an online FDA description. It said the program recognizes “through testing that certain products remained stable beyond their labeled expiration dates when properly stored.” “Currently, there have been minimal concerns about SLEP items” in Maryland, Gischlar said. It was uncertain if the masks in the second shipment were also technically expired. Gischlar referred further inquiries about that to the FDA, which manages the extension program. Reached by email, the FDA provided general information about expired products, but did not address particular shipments. In online advice for healthcare professionals, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control says that in a crisis, face masks may be used beyond their manufacturer-suggested lives. “The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials or visible tears), discard the product,” the CDC said. If no masks are available, health care professionals treating COVID-19 patients might use bandanas or scarves “as a last resort,” it said. In Pennsylvania, the health department said the state had discovered stockpile-supplied, expired N95 masks dating to the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, ABC News reported. The department said the expired masks have a failure rate of 5% to 10%, “meaning they may not be able to maintain a tight fit and allow dangerous particles and droplets to enter,” ABC reported. “In some cases, the elastic band could disintegrate all together.” In response to inquiries, Gischlar said Friday the health department would research the failure rate in Maryland, but did not have an immediate response. Maryland Hospital Association spokeswoman Amy Goodwin said the organization had not heard concerns related to extending the masks’ shelf lives. Across the country, medical professionals are increasingly desperate to find ways to extend the use of masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment, or PPE, as demand exceeds supply amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. Mask “supplies are getting thin,” said Bob Atlas, the Maryland Hospital Association’s president and CEO. “There’s certainly not enough to deal with the expected increase in patients,” he said. Business, universities, volunteer groups and others have tried to fill in the gaps. T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based money management firm, said last week that it donated 130,000 N95 masks to support health care providers in Maryland and Colorado. Wallace Loh, the president of the University of Maryland, College Park, tweeted Monday that the university retrieved more than 10,000 N95 and surgical face masks from emergency stockpiles it stored more than 15 years ago and donated them to the University of Maryland Medical System. Some supplies have come to states from the federal government’s Strategic National Stockpile, a large store of medical supplies for use when normal stocks are depleted in emergencies in the U.S. The stockpile is stored in locations across the country. The federal government does not specify the exact locations of warehouses, but members of the Maryland Air National Guard have helped distribute equipment from one stockpile near Baltimore. Airmen from the 175th Wing, based at Warfield Air National Guard Base at Martin State Airport in Middle River, assisted in “sorting medical equipment and supplies, preparing them for shipment and loading them on trucks to be distributed across the state," the Air Force said last week.

MLB and the players reached a coronavirus compromise. What does it mean for the Orioles?
.W
With so much uncertainty as to what sports and the world will look like once the coronavirus pandemic passes, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association reached an agreement last week that at least set up the framework for how baseball could operate when play does resume. There’s also protections built in for the players should the season not happen at all. For some teams who were hoping to maximize their current talent base and win now at the big league level, the prospect of a shortened or canceled season is dire from a baseball perspective. For the rebuilding Orioles, the calculus probably shifts a little bit. Many of the details of the agreement have been published at ESPN and The Athletic, among other outlets, outlining the salary advances to players, possible changes to the amateur draft and what could happen if there’s no season. Here are five aspects of the agreement that could have a significant impact on the Orioles and how they fare going forward in their rebuild. A five-round draft still presents a lot of options. If MLB goes forward with a five-round amateur draft, it will present a unique quandary for an Orioles front office who hopes to use the draft above all else to rebuild this team. With bonus levels not rising their customary levels from the 2019 amounts, the Orioles would have approximately $13.87 million for bonuses to use on six picks, with the recommended slot bonus for the second overall pick taking up a significant portion of that at $7.79 million. There are certainly drawbacks for the game as a whole and the 2020 group of draft prospects when it comes to a shortened draft and bonus levels not rising the way they were supposed to. But if the Orioles take a college bat like New Mexico State shortstop Nick Gonzales, sign him for a little below slot value and add a few more million-dollar college bats, the farm system will look a lot more balanced by this time next year. As it stands, the Orioles have a massive gulf in depth between hitters and pitchers; they should graduate Ryan Mountcastle and Austin Hays from rookie status this summer as long as the season happens, and that will leave top prospect Adley Rutschman and a bunch of pitchers as the cream of their minor leagues. Focusing on developed college bats won’t really cost the system much, since the Orioles’ 2019 draft and 2020 trades essentially gave them two rotations worth of pitchers for Low-A Delmarva, so they can probably manage without a large influx of pitching this year. They can also get the kinds of college arms they want as undrafted free agents off their model’s target list, so focusing on bats to supplement the improvement the team is hoping for from a new method of developing hitting could make for an effective use of resources in 2020. They might save a ton of money on Chris Davis and Alex Cobb. The Orioles’ 40-man roster is owed just a shade under $80 million for the season, and over $35 million of that will go to veterans Chris Davis and Alex Cobb. Thursday’s agreement, however, means that those two players will be advanced $150,000 over the next two months, with different amounts advanced to the rest of the roster based on service time. Shortstop José Iglesias has the only other guaranteed contract on the roster at $3 million this year. If games resume, those salaries will be prorated, meaning there could be significant savings for the Orioles on those high-priced veterans. Davis and Cobb have annual deferrals in their contracts of $6 million and $4.5 million, respectively, and it’s unclear how those are affected by a shortened season. Either way, a roster that was going to be among the least expensive in baseball will be even less so this year. With a possible sharp decline in television revenue because of fewer games for an organization that relies heavily on MASN for that cashflow, not having to pay as much as they otherwise would have for a team that’s destined for 100-plus losses isn’t the worst thing, so long as the money saved gets invested elsewhere. Going cheap on their rotation was smart. Cobb’s $14.5 million salary represents almost all of the money owed to the Orioles’ projected starting rotation, with John Means and Asher Wojciechowski still on pre-arbitration level salaries. That floor is $563,500, though they could be slightly above that. Otherwise, Kohl Stewart’s major league free agent deal was worth $800,000 in the majors, with the same reported value for minor league free agent Wade LeBlanc when his contract is selected at the start of the season. Left-hander Tommy Milone is presumably on a similar deal. This essentially means the low-risk, medium-reward gambit the Orioles took this offseason to stabilize their rotation is even lower risk, with the same reward of a rotation full of pitchers who are closer to league-average. The financial savings don’t really benefit anyone outside of the organization unless they’re invested in building a team that doesn’t need to paper over rotation holes in the future, though. Expanded rosters could mean the Orioles win a few more games, but also suffer bigger losses. The reported increase of roster sizes, at least for the first month of the season after what’s expected to be an abbreviated second spring training, could mean the Orioles have fewer decisions to make before rosters are finalized — and fewer tough decisions to make in games. Using one or two of those spots for a relief pitcher, if allowed, can essentially create circumstances in which the Orioles can hold back the likes of Mychal Givens, Richard Bleier, Hunter Harvey and whoever of Miguel Castro, Paul Fry or Shawn Armstrong is pitching well at that time for games when they’re winning and still have enough pitching to cover the rest of the days. That would get the best value out of those top relievers — should they all be better at protecting leads late than they were in 2019 — while also giving some low-leverage experience to the host of other bullpen options they’ll have who are looking to prove that they can eventually pitch in those higher-leverage moments. The hope already was that experience from 2019 would make the entirety of the Orioles’ fringe bullpen collection better. But the drawback of a plan like this is if it doesn’t, three-run deficits in the middle innings can balloon quickly as the team’s top relievers are saved for another night. Manager Brandon Hyde knows what those walks to the mound are like. He’ll be hoping for a lot fewer of them. If there’s no season, there’s going to be a lot of changes to this roster. All of these agreements were made with the worst-case scenario of no baseball being played in 2020, though it would be naïve to not regard that as a legitimate possibility. One of the players’ sticking points was how service time would work in that scenario, and they settled on the 2019 levels of service time being used in 2020 in the event of no games played this year. Service time is how players are able to earn more money through salary arbitration, get closer to free agency and accrue retirement benefits. For the Orioles’ purposes, the three-year benchmark to earn salary arbitration and the raise that comes with it is most relevant, though this year the cutoff for “Super Two” arbitration eligibility, which rewards players who were close to that level, was two years and 15 days. (The year before, it was two years and 34 days, so there’s a wide range of possibilities for that.) Either way, six Orioles could reach arbitration eligibility under this set-up — Pedro Severino, Renato Núñez, Shawn Armstrong, Hector Velázquez, Anthony Santander and Wojciechowski. Nonroster infielder Pat Valaika, who isn’t on the team yet but likely will be, could make seven. Severino, Armstrong and Núñez all earned full seasons in 2019, while Velázquez was close and would be in Super Two territory either way if that number was added to his existing total. For Santander and Wojciechowski, the math gets dicey depending on the Super Two cutoff, but they earned enough to get them past any possible threshold in 2019. All of this could mean that unless they prove themselves worthy or are willing to take less money in arbitration than normal, all those players outside Santander and maybe Núñez or Severino could be deemed too expensive, with a minimum-salary player replacing him on the roster.

Closing time: ‘Precarious to begin with,’ Carroll County’s restaurants and bars hope to weather closures caused by coronavirus 
.W
Faced with a statewide order from Gov. Larry Hogan to close shop for the foreseeable future to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus, Carroll County restaurants and bars are doing their best to cope — for themselves, their employees and their communities. Ernie’s Place, in Westminster, was ahead of the curve, posting a paper sign on the door to the neighborhood bar over the weekend announcing a voluntary closure that was anticipated to be temporary. “To all Ernie’s patrons we regret to inform you that we will be closed Sunday and Monday due to the coronavirus,” the sign read. “Please take this time to maintain personal health we will reopen 9 a.m. Wednesday.” Ernie’s will not be able to reopen Wednesday after Hogan’s announcement that all Maryland bars and restaurants close their doors indefinitely by 5 p.m. Monday, with exceptions made for carryout and delivery food servers. “We’re closed after 5 p.m. because I am a restaurant and bar, I am not carryout,” Westminster’s Maggie’s Restaurant owner Jim Breuer said in an interview Monday afternoon. “We have to do what we have to do and it’s for the welfare for everybody. So we going to follow the law. We’re closed at 5 p.m.” But if it was what had to be done, it still wasn’t easy, according to Breuer, and the path forward uncertain. “How are we handling it? We are still trying to figure it,” he said. “I just laid off all my employees. They are not going to get paid if I can’t open up. The best thing for them is they’re laid off — at least they can collect unemployment.” In Eldersburg, Salernos Restaurant & Catering has also laid off many of its employees, though it retains a carryout service, according to Owner Bruce Reamer. “We will be open for carryout, but on the delivery end, we’re not set up,” he said. “If we had a couple of days noticed we could try to figure out how we would deliver without using third party delivery. We have to check with our insurance.” Reamer said he understands the public health crisis at hand, but wished there could have been more time for restaurants to prepare for the closures, especially considering many of them had been investing in preparation for big St. Patrick’s Day sales. “We all got trucks in today, tomorrow is a big day obviously, and all that product is going to go in the garbage,” he said. "We cooked up two barrels of corned beef over the weekend for tomorrow. What happens to it?" But Reamer’s biggest concern is for the people who work for him. “They get unemployment, but a lot of these people live paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “How long will it take to get their unemployment check? Meanwhile the rent accrues, the car payments accrue. None of that was planned out ahead. That’s my frustration.” Belisimo’s four locations in Finksburg, New Windsor, Sykesville and Westminster will also close to diners and drinkers, but will remain open for carryout and delivery, according to owner Anna Cannon. “We plan on keeping carryout and delivery open as long as we are able to,” she said. “We do the same thing in a snow storm. It’s not always profitable to do so, but we see it as providing a service to the public. You have to be there in the good times and the bad.” Belisimo’s may even offer toilet paper and cigarettes for delivery, Cannon said, leveraging their wholesale connections to help people get needed supplies if they cannot get out of the house. “It’s not because it makes money, it’s convenience,” she said. “We have access to things the public doesn’t. We really just have to help people in times when they should not be going out.” And Cannon is also worried about her employees, as well as other hourly workers — she’s hoping to get some construction work done at the restaurant locations, taking advantage of the shut down, but also getting work to people who may need it. “I have 50 families I have to look out for. this is how they make their living,” she said. “As much as I can be open so they can provide for their families, I will will, even if I have to do it for a loss.” But these closures could be the first of many. In Italy, where novel coronavirus infections ramped up prior to the pandemic reaching the present levels in the U.S. — the U.S. had more than 4,000 known cases and more than 75 deaths as of 6 p.m. Monday — the entire country has been placed on lockdown. Six counties in California followed suit Monday, ordering people to shelter in place in their homes. Such measures aim to “flatten the curve,” that is, to slow the rate of novel coronavirus transmission so that the numbers of those who become severely ill at any given time will not overwhelm the capacity of the health care system. Such a strategy could require social distancing measures and restaurant closures for weeks to come. That worries Breuer. “The fact of the matter is, you have to have the liquidity to get your bills paid and then in 60 days be able to reopen,” he said. “Restaurants are precarious to begin with. We mostly operate off of cash flow and if the cash isn’t flowing ... there are a whole lot of small business that won’t be around in 60 days if liquidity is not offered.” What Breuer is hoping for is not a handout, he said, but some form of low cost small business loans to help restaurants restock, rehire and reopen. “The restaurant industry, employs 10 to 15% of the entire U.S. market, and the supply chain that takes care of it is humongous,” he said. “If you let these business fail because of liquidity issues, it’s not going going to solve anything.” It’s not clear yet if such loans or other help will be on offer, but the Restaurant Association of Maryland is trying to make the need for them known to leaders in state and federal government. “The Restaurant Association of Maryland is communicating with several state agencies so that they understand the needs of restaurants and their employees in order to get through these difficult times,” association President and CEO Marshall Weston Jr. wrote in an email. "We are hopeful that both the State of Maryland and the Federal Government develop plans for true relief to the many employees and restaurant owners that will be affected by the loss of business.” But even under the best of circumstances, it could take awhile for local restaurants to recover from these closures, and all the attendant costs that come with them, according to Reamer. “We’re slow in the winter, so we’re right in the beginning of our busy time. They just cancelled Wine in the Woods, which is a huge concession for us. That, the Maryland Wine Festival and the National Harbor Crab Feast are our three biggest events, that’s huge money,” he said. “It’s going to take us years to recoup from this.”

Compensating ballpark workers for lost time among Orioles’ considerations amid coronavirus delay
.W
With their remaining eight spring training home games canceled and their first six regular-season games at Camden Yards delayed at best, the Orioles have not yet determined whether they will compensate ballpark employees at either Ed Smith Stadium or Oriole Park for work time lost. On Thursday, the international coronavirus pandemic prompted Major League Baseball to cancel all remaining spring training games and delay the start of the regular season by at least two weeks, one of many impacts throughout sports worldwide. The Orioles were set to begin the 2020 campaign March 26 at home against the New York Yankees as part of a three-game series before hosting the Boston Red Sox for three games. The club then had a scheduled seven-game road trip to St. Louis and New York that falls within the two-week delay. “Just as government agencies and private businesses are grappling with the same circumstances, we have to determine solutions to a myriad of matters over an extended period of time as this public health situation — one unique and unprecedented in our lifetimes — unfolds,” Jennifer Grondahl, the Orioles’ senior vice president for community development and communications, said in a statement. “At the very outset of what may be an extended period of disrupted life, we will make decisions as soon as possible.” Amid the 2015 protests in Baltimore sparked by the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, three games at Camden Yards were relocated and another was notably played without fans. Another two games were postponed but eventually played in Baltimore as a doubleheader. Then, the Orioles reimbursed hourly stadium employees for the time lost for the four games that were either relocated or not open to the public. Workers reimbursed included ushers, ticket takers and security screeners, while Delaware North, which operates food, beverage and retail services at Camden Yards, also reimbursed its employees who missed time at those four games. It’s possible, for now, that the Orioles will not have to worry about any missed games at Camden Yards whatsoever. The expectation is that the schedule will pick up at the point when the season resumes, meaning as of now, Baltimore’s first game would be either April 9 at New York or April 10 at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates. If the delay is minimal enough, it’s possible the league will try to make up the games lost to the delay, allowing the Orioles and other teams to still play their full home slate. The Orioles had 80 scheduled games at Camden Yards, rather than the standard 81, because they are scheduled to host the Red Sox in the Little League Classic in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in August. If the delay extends deeper into the season, it becomes more likely MLB elects to play a shorter regular season, leading to a reduction of workable hours for ballpark staff across the country. With the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League suspending their season, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is one of a handful who have already promised to find ways to compensate venue and game staffers for time lost. Orioles executive vice president/general manager Mike Elias said on a conference call with reporters Friday afternoon that his focus since the MLB decision has been the baseball operations department that he oversees, but he said the organization is doing what it can to examine all aspects of the situation. “I know the whole organizational leadership is kinda working overtime to address every aspect of this crisis,” Elias said, “and I’m sure everything’s being looked at."

'This is a collective experience’: How Baltimore’s creative class practices self-care during coronavirus pandemic 
.W
Despite what your social media feeds and e-meets with friends and colleagues may suggest, there is no right way to emotionally handle the coronavirus pandemic. Keeping your mental health in check can be difficult in even the best of times, let alone one ruled by chaos and dread. Public health experts aren’t the only perspectives to learn from right now. People in the arts, restaurants and other parts of the creative class find meaning in chaos every single day. We consulted several Baltimore creatives to see how they’re dealing with this unprecedented moment. Amy Langrehr, Food blogger Amy Langrehr has used the quarantine as an opportunity to go diving — in her pantry. The blogger behind Charm City Cook has been preparing comfort food dishes like buttery egg noodles with kielbasa and peas, and white bean soup with garlicky toast, all from items she happens to have on hand in her Whitehall Mill apartment. Not every dish turns out Instagram picture-perfect, says Langrehr, who directs marketing and development for the GreenMount School. Just the other night she was making pasta puttanesca. She didn’t have anchovies, so she googled substitutions and used sardines instead. “It was not good. Not at all.” Her advice to home cooks? “Try to have the best ingredients you possibly can and very few of them.” She’s a fan of frozen cod from Trader Joe’s — it’s versatile and easy to cook — chickpeas and fresh herbs for every occasion. “Herbs are going to save your dish.” She also loves using leftover ingredients like chicken and vegetables to create stocks. “The feeling of not wasting food is my favorite thing in the whole world.” Langrehr has also done her part to support local businesses, ordering fresh seafood from JJ McDonell and CSA boxes from Chesapeake Farm to Table. She’s also been ordering fresh flowers, a small indulgence for a troubled time. With just one bouquet of bright blooms to liven up her apartment, “I feel better.” Arli Lima, Food blogger Arli Lima’s Instagram account is a mosaic of delicious things she’s consumed at Baltimore restaurants, from gooey macaroni and cheese to bright green cocktails garnished with a lemon. With restaurants mostly closed and her evenings suddenly free, she’s been going for long walks through downtown Baltimore and Mt. Vernon. Now that the streets are mostly empty, Lima has a chance to notice things that ordinarily escape her attention. “I’m always amazed to see the cherry blossoms up close.” She loves to see the petals fall to the ground. The pandemic, she says, “was a much needed break that I didn’t know that I needed.” James Nasty, DJ Many DJs had their livelihoods almost completely shut down when the pandemic forced gig cancellations and postponements. Heralded Baltimore DJ James Nasty wasn’t one of them, which is lucky for him. “I’m not really worried about income right now,” he said. “This is probably one of the biggest things that I hope artists can learn from me, and I’ve kind of preached to artists in this town for a while: live performance income is not the only income you can rely on, and shouldn’t be.” Nasty, who also books shows for North Ave. Market and runs Jones Falls Sauce Company, noted that he’s able to depend on income from licensing songs and related sources. Instead, the pandemic has pushed him to focus on “refreshing and recharging.” “I’ve been a full-time musician since 2012, and also a full-time entrepreneur, so I’ve been using this time, honestly, just to take a break and reconnect with being a person,” he said. “I’ve been doing a lot of hiking, and just taking my time and cooking at home.” Terence Hannum and Erica Burgner-Hannum, The Holy Circle The couple that forms two thirds of the dark electronic trio The Holy Circle are dealing with a lot of moving parts right now. As full-time educators, they’re navigating the switch to teaching online. They also balance this with the responsibilities of parenting their 8- and 11-year-old children. “We’ve had to try to start to draw some boundaries about when we’re going to be online working, and when we’re going to spend time together [as a family],” Burgner-Hannum said. That said, creating separation between the various roles they occupy (including as artists themselves) isn’t easy. The Holy Circle recently put a demo together to shop to labels; while this pandemic coincides with a break they’d planned to take, concerns about when they can go on the road and play the new material remain. Budgeting time for making and engaging with art, whether it’s listening to records or painting or writing in journals, has helped them stay sane. “For both of us, listening to the thing we made and talking about it, talking with Rob [Savillo, their bandmate in The Holy Circle] about new ideas and sending each other little demos, that’s kept us still optimistically creative,” Hannum said. The pair also noted that abandoning notions of a fixed schedule helped them incorporate creativity into their daily life. “Recognizing that maybe working in some time to go back and forth between my job and doing something creatively is probably really important for my mental and emotional health,” Burgner-Hannum said. Joy Postell, singer R&B songstress Joy Postell, like many artists, had key opportunities threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. For her, they’ve included a speaking engagement at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture and a show at the Ottobar. She admitted to having “moments of panic” towards the crisis’ beginnings. Now, however, she’s taken the time to both stay grounded and be productive. Her natural introversion has made what could be a more stifling time into something actually productive. She had recently put a lot of work into her upcoming album; now she gets to shift her energy to photo and video treatments, sitting with the music and other planning. “The timing kind of worked a little bit for me to be still for a second, because I’ve been working a lot, and now I’m sitting with everything I’ve been working on,” she said. Postell also makes time to skateboard and otherwise be outside for her mental health. Practicing daily gratitude helps her through all these endeavors. “I try to make sure I’m tapped in on my spiritual side,” she said. “I’m remaining grateful. If I start my day by saying ‘Thank you,’ it just sets the tone for, ‘Okay, things are going on, but there’s something to be grateful about.’” She encouraged others to maintain and build support systems during this time. “Don’t be afraid to reach out, pick up the phone,” she said. “This is a collective experience.” Mani Marino, rapper/singer The anxiety that Mani Marino feels around COVID-19 largely revolves around going to crowded stores and concern for older family members. “I’m my mom’s only child, and we have a really, really strong relationship,” she said. “She’s a woman who’s in her 50s, in decent health but, I would say, in some ways, immunocompromised. Just thinking about the possibility of her contracting this virus and what that might mean for her health is something that I’m trying to be really calm about.” Beyond these worries, the rapper and singer has used this moment to “unplug everything” and focus on herself. “We live in a really fast-paced world with a lot of stimuli, and that can be productive in a lot of ways, but it can also be a little overwhelming at times,” she said. “It’s nice to actually be just with myself and by myself for extended periods of time.” She advised other artists to lean into uncomfortable emotions and put their most honest selves into their work. For the rest of us, she had the following message: “Understand that this is temporary.” Kondwani Fidel, poet Between working on an MFA thesis, a new book release and other poetry, Kondwani Fidel is often busy in solitude. But he isn’t enjoying having to hole up as much as the pandemic demands. “It’s a difference from wanting to be in the house to having to be in the house,” the poet and educator said. “You can’t really enjoy the time that you spend alone because you’re just paranoid in a sense. I feel, for me, will somebody in my family catch corona? Or will I catch that s**t?” Despite those worries, Fidel tries to keep working through the troubles—even if, on some days, the enormity of the pandemic consumes his attention. He said he hoped to start a ritual of waking up early, reading and writing for a few hours before looking at his phone. “Soon as we wake up in the morning, the large majority of us, we go on social media,” he said, “Before we ever get out the bed…you know exactly how everybody else feel before you even question yourself on how you feel.” Fidel advised others to use this time to build supports and develop themselves as much as circumstance allows them. “Whatever your passion is, people should be definitely utilizing the time to pursue their passion and just become better at their craft,” he said. “I’m not being insensitive to those people who don’t really have the mental bandwidth to crank out work and read and write and create, because everybody’s mental capacity is different. There’s probably a person who can’t complete their art because now they got their kids 24/7, or they might be kicking out more money, probably picked up an extra job, probably drive for Uber and DoorDash now.” Anne Tyler, novelist The Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and longtime Baltimorean is a master at observing the social dance people engage in while navigating the tensions between the need for privacy and communal life — and during the pandemic, that distance has become more complicated and confusing than ever. “Isn’t it interesting that nowadays, a sign of goodwill is that when you see a friend in the distance, you cross to the opposite side of the street?” she writes in an email. “(With a wave, of course.)“ On Tuesday the Knopf Doubleday Publishing group released ”Redhead by the Side of the Road“ ($26.95). It’s Tyler’s 23rd novel and like most, is set in Baltimore. Tyler notes that though the disease has constricted human activity, the relative absence of foot and motor traffic has encouraged wild animals to move more freely about an urban environment than they would normally. “Yesterday I saw four deer as I walked down Deepdene Road,” Tyler writes. ”And a few blocks further on, I had to step around a robin taking a bath in a puddle, lifting both its wings to wash its underarms. I think the animals are delighted with the pandemic.“

‘We’re ready to take action’: Baltimore County police chief says residents need to follow restrictions amid coronavirus
.W
Baltimore County officials expressed frustration Friday over reports of residents and even some gyms defying state and local orders prohibiting social gatherings and closing businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic. “It is frustrating and shortsighted to see some disregarding the safety of their neighbors and risking the spread of COVID-19 for the purpose of socializing,” Police Chief Melissa Hyatt said in a statement shared with Baltimore Sun Media. “We have a duty to enforce the law within the authority that we are granted for the community to understand the magnitude of this pandemic,” Hyatt said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday amended an executive order to prohibit social gatherings of more than 10 people and mandated the closure of shopping malls, bowling alleys, pool halls, amusement parks and skating rinks. Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. shortly followed suit. “These are not recommendations; these are lifesaving measures that we will enforce,” Olszewski said in a statement. The governor had already ordered closing restaurants, bars and gyms March 16, a measure meant to contain the spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, a respiratory illness that has caused at least 10,000 deaths globally as of Friday. “These measures are necessary because we continue to see selfish and reckless behavior that jeopardizes the health and well-being of our loved ones, friends and neighbors,” Olszewski said. Police spokeswoman Sgt. Vickie Warehime said the department has been responding to reports of large social gatherings, mostly of teenagers, but also had to shut down some smaller gyms that remained open despite Hogan’s order. “This is a serious issue,” Warehime said. “If you do violate the governor’s orders, we’re ready to take action.” Confirmed cases in Maryland continue to rise, increasing by more than 54% since Thursday and totaling at least 149 in the state. Baltimore County had confirmed at least 13 cases Friday, including one case of a patient younger than 18, county health officials said. This week, a Prince George’s man in his 60s was the first Maryland resident to die from the virus, followed by the second death in the state, a Baltimore County man with underlying health conditions, announced Friday night. At least 16,600 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. Baltimore County Councilman David Marks said he reported groups of people gathering at parks and high school turf fields to the police this week, calling the action “extremely disconcerting.” “People have to realize that the reason why there have been escalating regulations is because there are citizen ignoring these requests” for social distancing, the Perry Hall Republican said. Experts recommend social distancing by keeping a 6-foot distance from others and avoiding the public sphere when possible as a way to head off the spread of the virus that could overburden state hospitals and kill vulnerable populations like the elderly or those with underlying health conditions. “A lockdown might have been inevitable anyway,” but “the continued crowding of people in public spaces is accelerating the movement toward the lockdown,” Marks said. California’s governor on Thursday announced an indefinite lockdown on all non-essential movement, followed by an identical edict in New York on Friday. The restrictions mean residents must stay inside except for work, going to the grocery store, pharmacy, bank or to pick up restaurant orders. “I wouldn’t be surprised if [a lockdown comes] sooner than later,” Baltimore County Councilman Tom Quirk said. “We’re seeing a lot of the major places already doing it.” However, the Oella Democrat said, “The short-term pain will be long-term gain. The quicker we really socially distance, the quicker this virus will [subside], the quicker we can all go back to work and recover.” Marks added the “outpouring of good will” with the emergence of community mutual aid groups and volunteers is “a silver lining” in the ongoing pandemic. “We know that there’s life on the other side of this,” Quirk said. “We just have push past this.”

During coronavirus, many are shopping at farmers’ markets. Here’s ones in Maryland that are open and when others plan to start up again. 
.W
The allure of grocery shopping outdoors after weeks of navigating confined spaces has people flocking to area farmer’s markets, where business has been brisk. “The sales figures are there,” said Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Joseph Bartenfelder, who is both a farmer and participant in the public retail market system. “Across the board it’s been a heavy buying season from what everybody tells me. People are finding the open air markets a lot more comfortable and safe than being in a grocery store.” Bartenfelder said the markets offer fresh produce that some grocery stores may not be able to stock. He said the only large market that is not opened because of crowding issues is Baltimore’s Downtown Farmers’ Market, traditionally staged under the Jones Falls Expressway at Saratoga Street. The delayed opening of the downtown market has resulted in more people going to the Saturday 32nd Street Waverly Market, he said. Below is a look at some of the area farmer’s markets, whether they are open for business and when others are expected to open. Anne Arundel County The Anne Arundel County Farmers’ Market, 275 Harry Truman Parkway, is open Saturdays and Sundays. The market has a roof shelter but is open air. Baltimore City The 32nd Street Farmers Market is open Saturdays from 7 a.m. to noon in the 3200 block of Barclay St. Vernon Rey, the market’s board president, said they have seen a busy spring. “Our business has been increasing and we are working on spacing issues.” Rey said that market’s sellers spread out this week to avoid crowding. The Cross Street Farmers Market opens Saturday, May 16 and runs from 9 a.m. to noon. It is located at the corner of Cross and Light streets in Federal Hill. Closed for now is the Downtown Baltimore Farmers Market & Bazaar, Saratoga Street between Holliday and Gay streets, under the Jones Falls Expressway viaduct. Organizers are working a configuration plan to accommodate social distancing. Baltimore County The Baltimore County Farmers Market at the Maryland State Fairgrounds at Timonium opens June 3 at 10 a.m. Carroll County Carroll County markets have delayed their openings. The Mount Airy Market is tentatively scheduled to open on June 3. The Sykesville Market has posted an opening date of June 21, and the Westminster Market, 27 Railroad Ave., has a May 16 opening date. Harford County The Bel Air Farmers Market, 2 S. Bond St., runs from 7 a.m. Saturday mornings beginning at 7 a.m. The Havre de Grace Market at Hutchison Memorial Park is open Saturday mornings. The Aberdeen Market has delayed its opening until June 4 at Festival Park. Howard County Howard County’s markets are planning to open this month, with changes designed to assure safe operation during the coronavirus pandemic. The five weekly markets across the county are scheduled to begin opening May 6 on a staggered schedule, and will remain open through November, according to a county news release. Three of the markets — at the Howard County Library System, Miller and East Columbia branches, and at Clarksville Commons — will be drive-thru only. The Maple Lawn market will be open for drive-thru and booth pickup, while the Oakland Mills Village Center market will be pickup only. Buyers are encouraged to order online ahead of time when possible. A farmers’ market at Elkridge Furnace Inn is held Wednesdays from 1 to 5 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 9 to 3 p.m.

Maryland leaders warn of coronavirus presence at CPAC as Rockville senior center residents are monitored for signs of illness
.W
Gov. Larry Hogan on Saturday announced another potential exposure point for the new coronavirus in Maryland: a major conservative political conference attended by President Donald Trump. The announcement, which urged other attendees of the Conservative Political Action Conference to monitor their temperatures and report any signs of illness to their local health departments, represented the latest effort among many to control the spread of the novel respiratory illness, both in Maryland and across the nation and world. Hogan’s office said the state’s health department was informed Saturday by health officials in New Jersey that a patient who had tested positive for the disease, known as COVID-19, had attended the CPAC event in the state’s Washington suburbs between Feb. 27 and March 1. The event, which pitches itself as “the largest and most influential gathering of conservatives in the world,” was held in National Harbor in Prince George’s County. Trump, a Republican, spoke at the event, which also was attended by Vice President Mike Pence. The White House says there is no indication that either Trump or Pence was in proximity to the attendee who tested positive. Hogan, a Republican who did not attend, said those who were there, including workers, “may be at some risk for acquiring" the disease. “Immediately after learning of this individual’s interactions in our state, we began coordinating with the White House, the CDC and federal officials, the New Jersey Department of Health, Prince George’s County officials, and conference organizers,” Hogan said. “Due to the scale of this conference, we are urging attendees who are experiencing flu-like symptoms to immediately reach out to their health care provider." Hogan said his office was “providing this update not to unnecessarily raise alarm, but in the interest of full transparency and out of an abundance of caution.” The warning followed another by officials at a Rockville retirement community that one of three Marylanders known to have the disease had recently visited, attending an event there. They said they were working with state health officials to monitor residents who may have come into contact with the patient, but had not identified symptoms in anyone else as of Saturday. Late Saturday, a spokesman for Hogan confirmed that a fourth patient was being treated for the virus in Maryland, after leaving the District of Columbia and presenting himself at a Maryland hospital. Mike Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, would not identify the hospital where the man was being treated. He said the case was formally being counted as a district case — the second — and not Maryland’s fourth. In addition to tracking potential exposure points, officials continued to ramp up testing efforts and prepare for more cases. Maryland health insurance officials, for example, ordered carriers to reduce barriers and costs for residents seeking medical treatment moving forward, including by waiving costs for testing for the illness. The order, facilitated by an emergency declaration by Hogan on Thursday, was intended to help ensure people can buy extra supplies of their prescription medications, waive out-of-pocket co-pays and deductibles for testing, and provide access to treatment that doctors deem necessary, even if providers are out-of-network. The order applies only to plans regulated in Maryland, though state regulators are encouraging voluntary compliance for other plans. CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the state’s dominant private health insurer and also a manager of many self-insured plans, joined other national carriers in announcing Saturday it would offer expanded access to testing and treatment to its customers. Officials have said they wanted to ensure testing and treatment are available, and that people do not avoid care because of costs or become saddled with large bills. The respiratory disease has sickened more than 100,000 people across the globe and killed more than 3,300. As of Saturday, a total of 44 Marylanders had been tested, with 41 negative. On Friday, Hogan said the three Montgomery County residents who had tested positive for the virus had been on an Egyptian cruise on the Nile River. The three — a couple in their 70s and an unrelated woman in her 50s — are currently isolated in their homes and their symptoms are abating, officials say. In addition to the three confirmed patients in the state, five of their family members have been advised to be tested, and officials continue to trace their contacts with others to determine if more people should also be tested, said Fran Phillips, deputy state health secretary for public health. The state of emergency allows Maryland to mobilize its emergency operations center and ramp up its coordination with local and federal agencies. The outbreak of illness has forced many changes across the region and world, including the cancellation of events. Amtrak, which operates trains through Maryland, announced that it would do away with change fees for reservations made through April 30. Citing reduced demand, it also announced that starting Tuesday, it would suspend non-stop Acela service between New York and Washington through May 26. It expected “minimal impact to customers.” Protestors in Baltimore raised concerns Saturday that those and other efforts to clear barriers to healthcare and mitigate the impacts of the spreading virus on people’s lives would not be enough. They said the disease and the potential fallout of widespread containment efforts would disproportionately impact the city’s most vulnerable residents, including those with pre-existing health conditions and low-wage jobs without paid sick leave. “Concerns for the elderly and the poor, the homeless, prisoners and our immigrant population need to be addressed sooner rather than later,” said Sharon Black, of the People’s Power Assembly, at a rally of nearly a dozen fellow activists outside Baltimore City Hall. The Village at Rockville said in a statement Saturday that state health officials have told them the risk of potential exposure associated with a visit by one of the infected patients — on Friday, Feb. 28 between noon and 6 p.m. — remains low, but that they were “taking the best practice in precaution" and “monitoring conditions of residents and team members who attended the event” through March 14. “Our primary focus is to maintain our highest level of well-being for our residents and team members,” said Kyle Hrebren, executive director at The Village Rockville, which is part of the National Lutheran Communities and Services, a Rockville-based nonprofit ministry of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. “We will remain diligent in taking the necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of our community and the greater Rockville community." Health officials say 70 to 100 residents, visitors and staff at the event might be at risk for contracting the coronavirus. They are urging them to monitor themselves for symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing, until March 13. They have also been told to take their temperature twice a day and notify their health care provider if it’s greater than 100.4 degrees or if they have other symptoms. Individuals who attended the CPAC event were given similar advice on Saturday. State officials did not provide an estimate for how many individuals may have come into contact with the attendee who tested positive for the virus. As of Saturday, there had been over 300 cases reported across the country and at least 17 deaths. As testing ramps up in Maryland and across the country, more cases are expected to be identified. The state stopped listing the number of pending tests online Saturday, so it is unclear how many have been tested in the state. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Defensive lineman Michael Brockers says coronavirus travel restrictions undid deal with Ravens 
.W
Michael Brockers began his first trip into free agency with uncertainty and excitement about what might be next in an eight-year NFL career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Rams. The stalwart defensive tackle ended up grateful for the bizarre twist that sent him back to the Rams after all. For about 10 days last month, Brockers thought he was joining the Super Bowl-contending Baltimore Ravens on a lucrative three-year contract. But the Ravens couldn’t assuage their concerns about his left ankle because of travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The worries led the Ravens to change its contract offer — and ultimately led Brockers to re-sign with the Rams, who had no such concerns about a player they know well. “Ultimately, I guess (the Ravens) just took their contract back,” Brockers said in his first public comments on the saga. “They were worried about the past injuries and what the ankle looked like on the MRI. So from there, the (revised) contract that they did offer, it was a lot of insecurity. I wasn’t secure in the contract, so when the opportunity to go to the Rams came back, it was like heaven. I always wanted to be back with the Rams. Always wanted to stay here.” Brockers and the Ravens’ medical personnel couldn’t travel to get a comprehensive examination of his ankle, which was badly sprained in the Rams’ regular-season finale. He underwent exams near his offseason home in Houston, but the Ravens got cold feet about what they saw. “It was all fine and dandy until the physical,” Brockers said. “Getting an outsourced physical for a team where their doctors don’t really get to look at you, don’t get to put you through some tests that might skew different images that they might have gotten.” Brockers and his wife had already moved out of their leased home near the Rams' training complex as they resigned themselves to leaving Los Angeles, where they had lived for four years since the Rams' relocation. The Rams are under severe salary cap constraints that forced them to part with several key veterans during the offseason, including starters Cory Littleton and Dante Fowler along with key role players Nickell Robey-Coleman and Marqui Christian. But the Rams highly valued Brockers, who has started alongside Aaron Donald on the defensive line for Donald's entire six-year career. Their partnership has been an ideal fit for both men, with Donald racking up his jaw-dropping numbers while Brockers largely does the dirty work on the line. “That's my brother,” Brockers said. “What we've built over these six years has been special. For me to sit back and tell my kids that I played with one of the greatest three-techs (pass-rushing interior defensive linemen) that ever played football is going to be awesome.” Donald expressed his disappointment on social media when Brockers agreed to a deal with Baltimore. The two-time AP Defensive Player of the Year was all smiles and jokes online when Brockers found his way back. “Aaron finally was talking to me again once we got Michael back,” coach Sean McVay said. “He was a little upset with me, I think, for a couple of days.” The Rams already made plans to replace Brockers after they thought they had lost him. Los Angeles signed defensive tackle A'Shawn Robinson away from Detroit as a free agent, believing the four-year NFL veteran could fill much the same role on its defensive line. But Los Angeles also paid close attention to Brockers and the Ravens, even after news of the initial deal came out through Brockers' agent. “We knew early in the game that there might be an issue with Baltimore and Michael and his physical,” Rams general manager Les Snead said. “At that point, I identified him as a bonus baby. Not that Michael's a baby. But long story short, there was a bonus baby out there. Michael has meant a lot to us here with the Rams, and we felt like, OK, is there a way that we can actually bring him back? And now we're better off on the defensive line than when we started.” With the Ravens behind him, Brockers realizes he’s in rarefied company with the chance to play a full decade for just one NFL team. He is the longest-tenured player on Los Angeles’ defense, and only long snapper Jake McQuaide has spent more seasons with the team among the active Rams. “We’re the 1% of the 1% of the 1%,” Brockers said. “So for me, man, this is a blessing. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, so I’m enjoying it as I go through it.“

‘We wanted to honor their work’: Howard County History Day lives on despite schools being closed due to coronavirus
.W
For months, students around Howard County had been filming documentaries about the origins of chemotherapy and the legacy of the polio vaccine, writing historical papers about Aretha Franklin and creating performances about former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. All of the projects centered on the same theme: breaking barriers in history. Awards for first, second and third places were recently given in the virtual Howard County History Day competition. This month, the Howard County Public School System found a way to host the 16th annual contest despite schools being closed due to the new coronavirus. The original in-person competition day was scheduled for March 14. “I feel really proud that we could offer the students something positive and something to give them some hope and encouragement when things are so unknown. I felt really good about that,” said Kelly Reichardt, district coordinator for Howard County History Day. “I think the biggest positive is we, the social studies and Gifted and Talented departments, wanted our students to know that we have appreciated their efforts and we wanted to recognize that hard work. We didn’t want the kids to think, ‘Ugh, now I did this for nothing.’ We wanted to honor their work,” Reichardt added. Howard County History Day is the first step in the countrywide competition run by the nonprofit National History Day, which chooses each year’s theme. While the competition begins locally in Howard County, student entries may then advance to the state and national competitions. “Children have the autonomy to pick the topics [that fit with the year’s theme] and how they present the information, but there’s a rubric to keep everyone on an even playing field,” Reichardt said. Students use their critical thinking skills to analyze their historical topic to figure out how it fits into their research question, thesis and in today’s society, she added. The virtual competition featured 184 projects from 268 Howard middle and high school students, including students who attend the public school system and local private schools. In the past, home-schooled students have also sent in entries for the competition. Each school sends in a maximum of 10 projects into the school system’s competition. Nearly 3,500 students in Howard County participated in this year’s competition, whether or not their projects made it to the actual competition. For Howard schools, all ninth graders either have to participate in History Day or write an in-classroom paper not associated with the competition. At the middle school level, all Gifted and Talented social studies students must participate during one of their middle school years, which is decided by each school. Students have the opportunity to either create a project on their own or within a group of up to five students. The projects were presented in five different categories: exhibit, performance, documentary, historical paper and a website. The performance category is normally a 10-minute piece where a student performs a monologue or a group of students performs together. The students are allowed to have props and costumes. For the virtual competition, students submitted their script for the performance category. Students who did the performance piece on their own were allowed to submit a video; however, group presentations could not do the same because of social distancing. As with the performances, the documentaries also could not exceed 10 minutes. The exhibit category is a traditional trifold board that one could find in a museum, featuring various graphics — tables, pictures, maps, quotes and charts — and can even have visual elements, with either an audio or video clip being added to the presentation. “It is about the content and the analysis. It can look pretty but if it’s not actually showing us the critical analysis and where it fits in history, it’s not fitting into the requirements,” Reichardt said. “It’s more than a poster board.” All projects required an annotated bibliography. The projects were remotely judged by 85 teachers, school system staff, Board of Education members, community members, county government representatives, business partners and university interns, formerly named student teachers. Using the same rubrics as the usual competition would have, the judges from their respective homes evaluated the various projects, at times collaborating with one another over video chat service Zoom, phone calls and Google Hangout, an instant messaging platform. “I have to really, really give these judges credit. They stepped up. Some may have their own kids, some are trying to telework and we figured this out and we made it work,” Reichardt said. “Some people opened Gmail accounts [for the first time] to make this work.” She added, “We met people where they were as it was so important for us to provide students with feedback.” Judges awarded first-, second- and third-place winners in each of the five categories. The top two winning entries in each category will advance to the virtual state competition in May, hosted by Maryland Humanities, a state educational nonprofit. From there, state winners will advance to National History Day which will be held virtually in June. Several other awards were presented to students, including the new Dr. Mark J. Stout Excellence in Historical Research Excellence Award and eight special awards presented by the event sponsors: the Council of Elders of the Black Community of Howard County, PFLAG of Howard County, Howard County Women’s Bar Association, the Howard County Historical Society and the Patapsco Heritage Greenway. In addition to the students, a Howard schools staff member also received an award from the Office of Secondary Social Studies. Jennifer Hamilton, media specialist at Oakland Mills Middle School, won the Howard County History Day Teacher of the Year award. While this year’s History Day was unorthodox, Reichardt hopes all of the participating students have taken a moment to reflect on their work. “It takes some time to get [to the end of the project]. There are some times on the journey where you don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I hope they do see a light at the end of the tunnel,” Reichardt said. “We hope students are learning lessons from history and that it helps them to make better decisions and that encourages them to be engaged in their own communities.” To view a list of this year’s Howard County History Day winners, go to hcpss.org/f/news/2020-history-day-winners.pdf.

Amid coronavirus-fueled panic buying, Baltimore-area grocers say they just need time to restock
.W
Relax, folks, we don’t need to buy out all the meat, bread and toilet paper. Despite the empty shelves in some stores, there’s plenty more in warehouses waiting to be delivered. Baltimore-area shoppers rushed stores again Monday, as the number of confirmed Maryland cases continued to grow, the governor issued new orders to shut down bars, restaurants, gyms and theaters, and the current closure of schools looked like it could stretch well beyond two weeks. But retailers warned against the panic buying that has stressed their supply chains — their warehouses, their delivery fleets and efforts to restock shelves. And they sought to reassure customers that they are prepared for what will undoubtedly be higher demand in coming months. “What folks are seeing right now is not a product of lack of supply,” said Ira Kress, interim president of Giant Food, the region’s largest supermarket chain. “There is not a food shortage. There is not a supply shortage. What there is is a delay in getting all those supplies replenished.” The initial run on food stores came on fast Thursday, after Gov. Larry Hogan and school officials ordered all public schools to close for two weeks beginning Monday to slow the spread of the COVID-19 illness in the state. Shoppers, some following advice to stock up for a two-week period, formed long lines that snaked their way through supermarkets. Items such as milk, bread, toilet paper and other goods became scarce and neighbors in online forums began offering tips for where to find what. Giant Food’s Kress compared Thursday and Friday’s shopping patterns to “Snowmageddon,” the February 2010 blizzard. While Giant Food’s business had been up in a range of 10% to 30% in recent weeks, demand suddenly doubled Thursday and Friday from business as usual. Kress likened it to having 2 feet of snow predicted every day for two weeks. Klein’s ShopRite, which runs nine stores in Baltimore and Harford counties and Baltimore city, had the biggest day in its nearly century-long history Thursday and then topped that Friday, said Marshall J. Klein, director of operations of the family-owned business. “We’ve seen an unprecedented increase in customer traffic and volume in every single one of our stores,” Klein said. Over the weekend, stores remained busier than usual, but less so than Friday. By Monday, though, Hogan ordered all bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms closed by 5 p.m. “We’re back to nuts," Klein said Monday afternoon. “We are reacting to the situation as fast as we can. ... The grocery industry is reacting, and we will be able to ramp up to meet the increased demand of our customers." Most of Klein’s delivery trucks, which come from a parent company distribution center in New Jersey, are one or two days behind schedule, he said. “The ability to get everything here faster is impacting the condition in the stores,” he said. “This isn’t local. This is countrywide. So all the wholesalers, all the suppliers, everything just got boosted all at once. It takes time for the system to ramp up to meet the demand.” Klein’s is bringing in extra trucks and extra staff, added several shifts to clean and sanitize stores, and quickly arranged an event for Thursday, Saturday and Monday at its training center on Riverside Parkway in Belcamp to hire seasonal workers to handle anticipated coronavirus-related demand. The company plans to hire cashiers for all shifts and overnight stockers. Other area grocers also indicated they will hire more people. But others are trying to catch up by scaling back. On Monday, Sunbury, Pa.-based Weis Markets said it would reduce its hours to 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily starting Tuesday to give workers more time to replenish products and sanitize stores. Trader Joe’s and Harris Teeter took similar steps. Retail groups are urging consumers to shop “responsibly” during the pandemic. “Retailers — particularly grocery providers — are working with manufacturers, suppliers and government agencies to make certain essential products and services remain readily available to customers," said a joint statement by the National Retail Federation and the Retail Industry Leaders Association. "Retail supply chains remain strong and retail employees are working around the clock to meet consumer demand. “If you don’t need an item in the next two weeks, leave it for someone who does,” the statement said. “Hoarding and stockpiling creates unnecessary gaps between the time that someone who truly needs a product can find it back on retailers’ shelves.” Events that lead to panic buying can hit grocers especially hard because supermarkets operate on thin profit margins and count inventory among their highest costs, said Ravi Srinivasan, associate professor in information systems, law and operations department in Loyola University Maryland’s Sellinger School of Business. “You carry exactly what you need and what you plan on selling and not a whole lot more than that,” Srinivasan said. “They have a general idea of what the demand is going to be for different products. Usually, there’s a general idea of how much toilet paper a retail store is going to sell. “With the whole hoarding that’s happening, it’s making this whole supply chain that’s clean and working like clockwork go out of whack,” Srinivasan said. The problem is exacerbated because demand is up for certain items all over the United States, so it can’t simply be moved from one high-demand market to another, he said. And manufacturers may not have the capacity to make more of an item, or they may need time to ramp up. “Retail stores are stuck in the middle,” he said. “You have consumers coming in and demanding products and manufacturers saying, ‘Hey, we can only make so much and cannot make more than my capacity right now.’” Giant Food’s Kress said demand is rising not only because of anxiety over the virus but also because school and university closures mean more people stuck at home eating more food in the home. The demand will only increase given the restaurant closures, he said. “If you limit the numbers of places where Marylanders ... can go to eat and drink, they’re still going to eat, they’re still going to drink, but you’re limiting the places they can get those things from," Kress said. “We are starting to see that and will see another ramp up.” Manufacturers are ramping up their production as demand rises, “which they have the capacity to do,” Kress said. Other components of the supply chain, from warehouses to the delivery truck fleet, need to catch up as well, he said. All of that could take several more days, unless new closings or concerns about the virus crop up, Kress said. The difference from a major snowstorm, he said, is that demand has not yet dropped back to normal. “We’re catching up,” Kress said. “You will see, and we are already seeing stores recovering and the conditions and in-stock position is getting better every single day.”

Amid coronavirus-related cancellations causing blood shortage, Keymar church hosts drive
.W
The American Red Cross is facing a severe blood shortage created by an “unprecedented” number of blood drive cancellations in response to the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. While others were canceling, Keysville Evangelical Lutheran Church in Keymar held a blood drive Monday, March 23 and, according to Rebecca Engel, one of the organizers, this drive had more registered participants than they’ve ever seen. “People have called and wanted to give, that we don’t usually have on the schedule,” Engel said. Special precautions were taken. The Red Cross has implemented measures to ensure blood drives and donation centers keep both donors and staff safe. Those measures include checking the temperature of staff and donors before entering a drive, providing hand sanitizer for use before a drive and the donation process, spacing beds to follow social distancing practices where they can and increasing enhanced disinfecting of surfaces and equipment, according to the release. Keysville followed the new measures according to Engel. In addition, they only had three people at a time give blood. Because of the shortage, people really wanted to donate, she said. “I told everybody that we call that, of course, we’d take their temperature beforehand and most of them are satisfied,” said Engle. “There’s a few that have small babies in a family or have had an illness and they don’t want to give and of course I said ‘please don’t come.' We don’t want anything like that to happen but we’re just being proactive about the whole thing. Not many people have expressed any fears, which I am surprised about." According to Regina Boothe Bratton, external communications manager for the Red Cross, as of Sunday there were 6,500 blood drives cancelled nationwide, resulting in more than 200,000 uncollected units of blood. “That is an unprecedented number,” said Bratton. “So, it’s a real serious situation. ... This is a severe blood shortage.” People were able to register on site at the Keysville church event, so they could get as many donations as possible. Engel claimed she hadn’t see a shortage like this one before in her 20 years of volunteering for blood drives. “They’re always short on blood but they have had to cancel so many blood drives because of the colleges and high schools being closes and the churches, where they normally hold the events," said Engel. "They’re closed so they can’t get in so they have lost so many drives, that’s the hard part.” The Red Cross is getting the word out about the shortage to make sure people are aware so they can help. The shortage has led to preservation tactics with the blood for serious cases. “It’s not just a Red Cross issue, it is a blood industry issue. We’re all experiencing the pain and it’s really putting patient care in jeopardy," said Bratton. "Elective surgeries have been cancelled left and right, dental procedures cancelled because we need to preserve the blood for the most critical cases.” More than 80 percent of the blood collected from the Red Cross comes from these drives, according to the release. There is one other blood drive in Carroll County scheduled for this week. It is set for Thursday at Sandy Mountain United Methodist Church at 2101 Old Westminster Pike in Finksburg from 2:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Willing donors are encouraged to call1-800-Red-Cross or redcrossblood.org to get updated information, according to Bratton.

Here is how Maryland’s $175 million small business coronavirus relief programs will work
.W
A state program of more than $175 million will provide businesses with grants, loans and other relief to help pay workers, suppliers, landlords and other expenses during the coronavirus pandemic. The program is designed “to help hard-pressed Marylanders and small businesses get through this difficult period,” Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday at a State House news conference. The program will draw on the resources of the Commerce and Labor departments. The relief is targeted to small businesses, which often have more difficulty absorbing sudden revenue losses than larger companies. “We have heard from many, many businesses that are frightened and unsure about what to do,” Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz said. “They want to keep serving their customers and they want to keep paying their employees. They want to still be here when COVID-19 is fading only into our memories.” The state on Monday ordered the closing of retailers and all other “nonessential” businesses. But “many businesses are still open,” Hogan said. He said those include “everybody in the supply chain, to make sure we get all of the necessary goods and services out to everybody.” Among those still operating are pharmacies, health-care related organizations, grocery stores, banks, convenience stores and others. Maryland had already shut down movie theaters and restaurants, although carry-out, delivery and drive-through sales are permitted. The U.S. Small Business Administration has its own program under which the state’s small businesses are eligible for low-interest loans of up to $2 million. Applicants may apply here or call 800-659-2955 for information. Here are highlights of the program, who they serve, and how to apply for each: — A $75 million fund will provide loans of up to $50,000 to businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The rate is 0% for the first 12 months, and 2% for the remaining 36 months. Applicants “must demonstrate financial stress or disrupted operations” to be eligible. Businesses can apply here. — A $50 million fund will supply grants of up to $10,000 to small businesses and nonprofits that have lost revenue. The grant amount can’t exceed the three months of operating expenses incurred during the first quarter of this year. The state says the money is to be used for payroll, rent, mortgage, utility costs or “other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of operations.” To be eligible, the annual revenues of the business or nonprofit can’t be more than $5 million. Businesses can apply here. — A $7 million “layoff aversion” fund is to help small business retain their employees during the pandemic. “Small businesses can apply now for up to $50,000 in very flexible funding to help continue operations and keep Marylanders working,” Labor Secretary Tiffany Robinson said. For information and a link to application, click here. — A $5 million incentive program is to help Maryland manufacturers produce personal protective equipment for health-care workers across the country. The state said information about the program will be available Friday. — Another $40 million is available through already-existing programs, according to the state. Information is available here.

New Windsor on-farm market helping Carroll County small businesses sell products during coronavirus crisis
.W
An on-farm market in New Windsor is helping other Carroll County businesses by distributing their products during coronavirus-related closures. Local Homestead Products LLC, owned by Trevor and Victoria Hoff, has become a hub for local businesses to sell some of their products. “Our market is based around local businesses even before all of this started, so a lot of the local restaurants bought produce from us, of course, the things that we were growing,” said Victoria. “So our relationship was kind of already opened up through us supplying them with produce. So with everything going on, we know that the restaurant industry is struggling. "So we kind of turn the tables around and they’re now supplying us. So it’s a different way of doing it, but it’s worked out really well.” Local Homestead Products has partnered to sell products from a variety of local businesses including Uncle Matty’s in New Windsor, Molli’s Cafe in Westminster, Starry Night bakery in Westminster, Whispering Breeze in Taneytown and many more. According to Victoria, customers have been responding well to the additional products. “We find that people really like the convenience of having multiple products at one location and to be able to feel that they’re supporting multiple small businesses without having to go place to place you know, eliminating that social distancing," said Victoria. They are hoping this will help local businesses both now and in the future. “All the local businesses, we’re all a really tight-knit community and we don’t want to see each other fail,” said Victoria. “Knowing that we’re still open and we have the people coming to us, it’s kind of a win-win because we can increase sales for our restaurants, get their name to our customers and get their product to our customers. So hopefully in the future when this all goes back to normal, they’ll remember that and be able to go directly to the restaurant and get the same great food that’s on our shelves today.” The on-farm market has also taken multiple measures not only to help other businesses but members of the community as well. They have expanded their business hours from only being open Friday through Sunday to also being open Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Tuesdays, they have a 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. time slot for high-risk shoppers only, which include those with a compromised immune system, elderly or pregnant. As an additional measure they only allow up to 10 shoppers at a time but during high-risk shopping, they only allow five at a time to emphasize social distancing. “We found that people are very patient and very understanding and have definitely been giving people their own space. So it’s really worked out the best that it can for the situation,” Victoria said. They are also repeatedly and thoroughly disinfecting. “We’re encouraging people to pay with credit cards that way we’re not handling cash. All of our employees are wearing gloves and changing them throughout the day and washing hands throughout the day. We are wiping down all of our baskets and carts and door handles and any hard service at least every hour," said Victoria. "During the shopping period, we’re wiping down baskets after every use. We’re doing a lot of extra measures that I think are really essential and really go a long way and being able to stay open because who knows what’s gonna happen in the weeks to come.” They also have a hand washing station and require all guests to wash their hands before entering. The on-farm market is located at 2425 Marston Road. Hours are: Tuesdays from noon to 7 p.m. (with noon to 3 for high-risk shoppers only), Wednesday from noon to 7 p.m. Fridays from noon to 7 p.m., Saturdays from 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. They are closed Mondays and Thursdays. For updates on their products, inventory and hours, shoppers can visit the market’s Facebook page.

Smaller sizes allowed Carroll County private schools to turn more quickly to online learning amid coronavirus
.W
On Friday morning, Chef Dave Luscher was setting up his kitchen to cook for a smaller group than the normal crowd of students and staff at Springdale Preparatory Academy in New Windsor. That day it was just a handful of essential staff and faculty still in the building and a video camera. While the students are learning from home as part of social distancing measures meant to slow the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, Luscher’s cooking classes are one of the extracurricular activities the school is offering its students online. As the public school system in Carroll County rushes to find equitable ways to teach 25,000 students from a distance, many area private schools have already gotten started, able to move more quickly with their smaller sizes and for some, already established technology infrastructure. Springdale Prep students began online learning March 18. Deputy Head of School Lorraine Fulton was eager to share her pride over students and staff. Their effort “demonstrates school spirit and ability to carry on when they have challenges,” she said. The school has 67 students across all grade levels, about 30 of whom are are boarding students from all over the United States and the U.S. Virgin islands. One of the first steps in planning was to figure out how to send boarding students home without causing financial burden to families, said Erin Holden, associate dean of academics and instruction. Part of keeping a structured environment was writing an adjusted honor code for an online environment and having each teacher draft their own “classroom” expectations. Attendance is still taken and there is even Saturday school if a discipline issue arises. “We have been accountable to them and they have been accountable to us,” Fulton said. In addition to academic curriculum, students are also beginning online extracurriculars like the cooking lessons, book club, jazz music and strength training. Students will soon be able to register for a 10-day course for preparing for the SAT and PSAT. Fulton was excited the first time she got to drop in on a virtual class and see students’ faces. “It makes you realize how we’re all connected,” she said. “I’m so proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish. ... As a small school, we have fewer obstacles to overcome to make this positive initiative a reality, but we’ve done it and I just want to share it.” Administrators from Springdale attended the National Ossification of Independant Schools conference in late Febuary where they started using resources there to make COVID-19 plans. Emergency preparations began the first week of March and before dismissing students on March 15, the school held training session for students to let them know what was coming with virtual learning. Alongside academics, the school’s tutor is also offering services. “We’ve gotten incredible feedback, which I wasn’t expecting,” Holden said. She expected more communication about problems, and while there have been hiccups, she said, “overwhelmingly its been positive.” The school uses Google cloud services to hand out and turn in work, and makes use of both Google platforms and Zoom for video communication with the classes. Kirsten Milne, who teaches 9-11th grade science classes, said her main concern is “making as many resources available to students as possible,” from lectures to books. As a physics and chemistry teacher, her classes have not yet had to miss any scheduled labs, but as distance learning continues, she has identified interactive virtual labs and video labs. She predicts that for some students, learning online might even be more familiar to the way their tech-savvy generation is used to interacting with information. With the nation focused on remote work and learning, companies are putting out new online resources “hourly.” She has also tried to provide structure, and requires that students are getting up on time for classes. Teachers have freedom to chose how to conduct classes, but many in the middle school level, especially, are making face-to-face video connection mandatory, and some are setting standards for sitting upright during class or maintaining a level of proper dress code. For high school students, many have more freedom as long as they are checking in and chatting regularly. The school is approaching a two-week spring break and will return to classes April 15. Before April 24, administration will reevaluate whether to return to school or continue online instruction. “This is a whole new world for us, just as it is for evetybody,” Fulton said. Carroll Christian School The Westminster kindergarten through high school facility started its distance learning program March 16, immediately after Gov. Larry Hogan’s announcement of public school closures. They started with work packets for students through a drive-thru system for picking up and turning in work. Meanwhile, technology staff began setting up students and staff for virtual classroom learning, which began March 23. Teachers teach video lectures just as they would in person, and students watch from home. Teachers can add video links and supplemental resources as needed. Then there are group sessions for discussion and further instruction. “We are offering digital format for tests and quizzes, etc., when we can,” Principal Matthew Reisberg said. “Obviously, some of these things help elementary and some are more beneficial for secondary. We try to use what works best for each group.” He recognized the Teach Team who worked hard to put structure in place and train staff members. “It has gone very well,” he said. “The staff has done well to learn new things and to implement them and the students have done great at applying themselves and learning. ... We just miss having the kids physically with us." Mount Airy Christian Academy Mount Airy Christian Academy began distance learning March 18 after two days away from school that were counted like inclement weather days. About 310 students attend the school across all grade levels, preschool through 12th grade. Head of School Vicky Webster said the first thing they set out to do was to “calm everyone’s fears to let them know that we were prepared and that we were in this together.” “Our team began the day in prayer and we reflected on all the ways that God went before us to prepare us for this new season at MACA,” she told families in a video message. Two administrators happened to have been working on graduate- and doctoral-level work related to distance learning and they were ready to help with the transition. Students at the high school level already had been provided with Chromebook laptops as part of tuition and students at all levels have some familiarity with computers in the classroom. Hoping to keep things positive, for their first day of virtual learning, they held a “first day” photo contest on social media, and participants were entered in to win a gift card to a local restaurant. Each day, first thing in the morning, students receive a video from teachers for each of their subjects and notes on what assignments to complete for the day. “It’s important to us that that relationship continue as much as possible,” Webster said in an interview Friday. On a class-by-class basis, teachers have set up times when students might be able to video chat for help, and teachers are responsive to email. They hope to provide structure and continuity, she said. But at the same time, they wanted a model where students did not have to be doing their classwork at a set time, to help families where multiple students may be sharing one computer. ‘We try to be understanding of families’ schedule as well — we respect that not everyone can do a ‘regular’ schedule" she said. But they want to make the option available for those who prefer a set daily routine. The weekly chapel for students is being filmed also, and families are encouraged to share in it with their children. Kristen Furr, director of marketing and a parent of a student at the school, said that quick continuity from in-person to online learning was comforting to her as a parent. “It just took one less worry off the parents’ plate,” she said. The school plans to hold its Easter break from classes as scheduled and because only two days of instruction were missed, plans for the last day of school to stay on schedule. This model means long hours for teachers, Webster said, as they work to prepare videos for class. For their students, “these teachers are heroes,” she said. “They are shining out bright in a difficult time.” Gerstell Academy The all-grade school in Finksburg has been keeping families informed about their education continuity plan with updates online and messages from President John Polasko. Remote educational opportunities have been put in place for lower, middle and upper school students and include academic classes as well as special areas. Division heads at the school are holding video conference meetings with parents to update them while the school remains closed to in-person learning, at least through April 24. A school administrator could not be reached for comment on this story. North Carroll Community School The Westminster school, which teaches about 105 students across grade levels, is prepared to start distance learning on Monday, March 30 with a focus on teacher created content. Teachers are working on preparing video lessens and interactive games to teach concepts. In the two-week gap between schools closing and the formal start of teaching online, teachers connected with students virtually “for that social piece and keeping that community piece intact,” said Administrator Sam Havighurst. They’re also focusing on creating structure by establishing virtual “office hours” for teachers, in the form of an hour set aside daily for web-chatting with families, and designated email hours from 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. They understand that some parents may need flexibility with those hours, particularly in uncertain times for many industries, and are prepared to be flexible, Havighurst said. To prepare for distance learning, the school’s learning support specialist led the charge to help staff and students transition online. All middle school students already had a device provided by the school. And because the school uses an online portal extensively for day-to-day interaction with families, they had already addressed connectivity for the most part with all families, he said. Overall, he said, “It’s a lot of new for everybody.” The Montessori School of Westminster Head of School Jodi Lupco said in an email, that The Montessori School of Westminster has endured many challneges since its founding in 1974. “This pandemic is one more challenge that will go into the history books.” Friday, March 13 kindergarten through eighth grade students went home with paper and pencil work for two weeks. Parents of younger students aged two to four received some digital activities. Monday, march 30, they moved learning online. “Our youngest students will be able to view recorded lessons, songs, and stories read by their teachers with their parents. The parents will also have access to an online digital file with a variety of activities to do with their children. Elementary and Middle school students will be engaging in live and recorded lessons each day as well as having access to digital assignments using a combination of Office 365 and Zoom,” Lupco said. They are also encouraging families to value the daily tasks and chores of life at home such as cleaning and spending time outside because “Montessori pedagogy has a strong commitment to practical life skills and the environment," she said. “We recognize that many of our parents are working from home now and managing distance learning with their child will be a learning process. It is important to us that we give our parents the flexibility to create a schedule that works for their entire family. We have a wonderful school community filled with parents and staff that are working together to stay connected while physically being apart!,” she said. Carroll Lutheran School Principal Mandy Gilbart said Friday, March 13 was their last day of in-person instruction, and they worked hard to get students everything they would need to for their first two weeks away from the school. For most this meant pencil and paper work and activities on educational websites they were already familiar with from class. The school provided Chromebooks for families who needed devices. During those two weeks, Gilbart and the staff were “all hands on deck” as they prepared to start learning via Google Classroom on March 30, where students will be expected to check in daily, complete assignments and meet for chat or video discussions. The staff met for video meetings and helped each other become more familiar with the Google classrooms platform, making sure assignments were showing up or videos were posting correctly. In the meantime, the school was in daily contact with families, keeping track of how students were feeling and making sure they had WiFi and other resources. The school has about 65 students and 21 staff total. The expectation is not that students will be working eight hours a day constantly like they were in school. Gilbart said their message is enrichment activities like outdoor exercise, arts and crafts, cooking and other activities are important for kid’s a physical and mental health. Her goal when addressing families through a series of videos has been to “really factual but really uplifting and encouraging,” she said. She doesn’t share hypotheticals, only actions she knew the school would take. She hopes the message to students was “it’s going to be OK, they are loved, we have your back ... and reminding them that our school community is still a community.”

D.C. church reports that its rector tests positive for coronavirus; another man with virus hospitalized in Maryland
.W
A prominent Episcopal church in Washington suspended all activities Sunday after announcing that one of its senior leaders was the first person in the nation’s capital to test positive for the coronavirus. The Rev. Timothy Cole, the church rector, was in stable condition after being hospitalized Saturday night, according to a statement from the Rev. Crystal Hardin, the assistant rector. ``Out of an abundance of caution, Christ Church has canceled all activities including church services until further notice. We recommend that concerned community members contact their health care providers," the statement said. “Above all else, we know that whether we meet in person or in spirit, not one of us is alone while we have each other. And, we firmly believe that we are held in God’s embrace through it all. Praying without ceasing for all affected, for all in fear, and for all who are working to find solutions,” the statement said. According to the church's website, Cole has been the rector since September 2016. “He brings with him the depth of his experience in service with and to young people and families, a dedication to pastoral care and community building through outreach and prayer, a joy in traditional liturgy and music, and a commitment to scripture,'' the site says. He is married and has two children. Officials on Saturday had announced the district’s first positive test, but identified the victim only as a man in his 50s. A second local positive test involves a man who visited the Washington area from Nigeria, but he was being hospitalized in Maryland, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. Health officials said Sunday said they had determined as part of their investigation that “an individual’s visitation to Christ Church Georgetown warrants precautionary measures” and they recommended a temporary halt to services. In response, the church publicly identified Cole as the victim. Virginia recorded its first case Saturday when a Marine stationed at Fort Belvoir was found to have the virus. On Sunday, Virginia officials announced a second case involving a Fairfax man in his 80s who took a Nile River cruise. District officials said they had no plans to cancel any events, including the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, which starts March 20 and draws thousands of tourists. "We recognize that it is fluid and every day we will monitor the situation on the ground in the district," Bowser said. Dr. Jennifer Smith, who leads Washington’s public health laboratory, said officials have the capability of testing about 50 patients per day. The district has also ordered more than 42,000 masks to be delivered to the district’s fire and emergency medical workers, officials said. Officials said they were in contact with their counterparts at health departments across the U.S., including in New York and California, after two people who attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee event in Washington recently were diagnosed with coronavirus. Maryland officials said a person who attended the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Oxon Hill had tested positive for the virus. Both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the conference. The White House said there was no indication that either had met or were in “close proximity” to the infected attendee. The Marine at Fort Belvoir was the first military case of coronavirus reported inside the U.S., said a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case. The Marine was being treated at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, located south of Washington, and had recently returned from an overseas assignment, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said on Twitter. Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, director of epidemiology and population health for the Fairfax County health department, said the Fairfax man developed systems of respiratory illness on Feb. 28 and was hospitalized on March 5. He remains hospitalized but is in stable condition and not in an intensive care unit, Schwartz said. "Fortunately, the individual had limited contact with others while ill, and therefore the risk to the general Fairfax community remains low," said the county's health director, Dr. Gloria Addo-Ayensa. Virginia state epidemiologist Dr. Lilian Peake said testing for the Fort Belvoir case was done at Walter Reed medical center, and testing for the Fairfax resident was done at a state lab in Richmond. "The two cases are not related," Peake said. "At this point, there are no signs of the virus spreading in the community in Virginia."

Five unanswered Orioles questions as coronavirus shutdown cuts short spring training
.W
As Major League Baseball and the Orioles grapple with the reality that it will be months before baseball resumes in any significant way, the coronavirus pandemic that caused it will get a lot of the attention in the interim. After a month of spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and only weeks away from starting the season, the Orioles were on track to unveil a vastly different team March 26 from the last one that played at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. All that has changed, though. So while there might have been some indication as to what this team could look like before such a delay, all that’s left now is to speculate until the players start working out again. Here are five unanswered questions left by the shutdown: 1. Was the Chris Davis renaissance real? If one on-field facet of spring training trumped the rest, it was Davis looking like a monster at the plate again — the kind that terrorizes the other team, not his own. He homered three times in his first four games, began the spring with a long on-base streak, and once the power stopped, he ended up putting together productive at-bats with runners on base and either driving in runs or advancing runners in situations when the Orioles would have been left wanting in the past. Of course, as everyone knows, it was spring training. And now, it will be months before there’s any indication it will work when games count. But if Davis’ plan to add muscle worked during one months-long break, he could run it back again during this shutdown and be even stronger once baseball resumes. 2. Was the new pitching strategy going to work? At the time of the shutdown, it looked pretty clear that the Orioles’ rotation was going to feature veteran nonroster free agents Wade LeBlanc and Tommy Milone behind the returning trio of John Means, Alex Cobb and Asher Wojciechowski. However, the team wasn’t really giving them much of a showcase in games with two turns of the rotation remaining before spring training ended. That made sense considering their nagging physical issues (Cobb’s blister, Milone’s neck soreness), but it made it hard to judge what was going on. There was also Kohl Stewart preparing for the season as a rotation candidate, but he made just one three-inning start. The Orioles easily could have started Stewart in the minors, either on a rehabilitation assignment or an option, to get the 2013 No. 4 overall draft pick further acclimated to what they want him to do to realize his vast potential. In the interim, it was just going to be a rotation that might have checked in as the league’s oldest tasked with stabilizing a team that was pretty green elsewhere. It was a decent gambit as far as 2020 respectability went, but who knows what it will look like when things start to count mid-summer. 3. How quickly were the kids going to get to Baltimore? Informed by last year’s spring training in which players whose roster status and experience level dictated they should make the team over all else, there wasn’t much expectation that someone such as Ryan Mountcastle or Yusniel Diaz was going to break camp with the team after a good spring. What this could have shown, however, was how close they are to joining the Orioles once circumstances allowed it. Mountcastle didn’t help his cause by not walking once in 34 at-bats, though he showed there was still plenty of power in his bat and that he could play the outfield. Diaz was slowed by a shoulder injury that kept him out of games early but still showed all the fantastic tools that will make him a factor with the Orioles at some point. What this shutdown could do, however, is create a shortened season in which there’s even less incentive to start the club-control clocks for their young impact players, meaning it could be next year when those players finally get the call to the big leagues. 4. Was anyone playing his way onto the Opening Day roster? In some cases where prospect status wasn’t an issue, spring performance might have been a separator for the Orioles’ front office in terms of which players they took north — notably on the bench and in the bullpen. On the bench, Andrew Velazquez, Pat Valaika, Stevie Wilkerson and Mason Williams all made strong impressions, as did catcher Bryan Holaday. It might have been hard to add more than one or two to the 40-man roster at once with only Velazquez on the roster. In the bullpen, there was some buzz around camp about Rule 5 draft pick Michael Rucker before he was sent back to the Chicago Cubs. Since he was sent home, others who could look good in the seventh or eighth spot based on spring outings include Eric Hanhold, Cole Sulser, Branden Kline and Travis Lakins Sr. No matter when the season starts, they’ll probably all get a chance. They’ll just have to bottle up whatever has worked and keep it going. 5. Could this have been a competent bullpen? It seemed like the Orioles were going to have a lot more options to put together a better bullpen than they did last year, when the group was historically bad. Part of that would just have required consistency from the five players who were considered fixtures entering this year — Mychal Givens, Richard Bleier, Shawn Armstrong, Paul Fry and Miguel Castro. Part of that would have meant having a full year of the electric, hirsute Hunter Harvey. But the two swing spots after that, with all the candidates mentioned above or some combination of Hector Velázquez and David Hess adding length and cover as the long reliever, could have made for a much better group. And that’s all without mentioning the dominant performances at times this spring from Tanner Scott, Dillon Tate and Cody Carroll. It was all shaping up to be a much more interesting group — partly because of the additions and partly because of the message all those additions sent. It was working, though, so perhaps it will again.

Darlington cancels 2020 Independence Day festivities due to uncertainties surrounding coronavirus
.W
The Darlington Lions Independence Day Committee announced Tuesday the cancellation of the planned 35th annual Darlington Independence Day Celebration that had been scheduled for Saturday, June 27. “The State of Maryland continues to operate under the governor’s stay-at-home executive order and is limited to gatherings not exceeding 10 persons. While the governor has laid out the procedures for reopening the state, an implementation date of those procedures has not been set, but tied to 14-day declines in the rate of hospitalizations and patients in intensive care units,” the announcement states. “The ability to have a large social gathering or event is phase-three of the phased approach laid out by the governor and relies on meeting performance milestones as opposed to a set schedule. Thus, it is unclear if our event would be allowed in eight weeks.” The Darlington Independence Celebration is supported by personal donations from the community and area businesses. Solicitations for funding are typically mailed in May. “While we are confident in the community’s desire to support the event it was felt unreasonable to request funds at a time when there were so many unknowns. In addition to the uncertainty associated with the ability to have a large public gathering in less than two months, there were also concerns over whether youth marching bands, scout troops and school groups would be able to participate. As a result, it was felt best to cancel the event in the interest of safety for all.” The Darlington Lions Independence Day Committee said it looks forward to planning and hosting a 2021 celebration on June 26. The community of Kingsville, which borders Harford and Baltimore counties, has also decided to cancel its traditional July 4 parade, according to the website www.kingsvilleparade.org. “The enjoyment of the parade that each of us have experienced in the past is the result of weeks and months of planning with commitments necessary to develop before the actual event. This conclusion was made with ‘an abundance of caution’ regarding future restrictions,” the website states. However, the committee is having discussions about “alternative ways for our community to celebrate,” Independence Day. In Harford County, the communities of Bel Air, Havre de Grace and Edgewood/Joppatowne also host activities around the Fourth of July. Michael Blum, the parade chairman and vice president of the Bel Air Independence Day Committee, so no decision had been made about festivities in Bel Air as of Tuesday. “Like events of all sizes across the nation, we will follow federal, state, and local orders to ensure we do our part to protect the public’s health and well-being,” he said. “I don’t know if there is a line-in-the-sand timeline for making any decision.” Messages to coordinators in Havre de Grace and Edgewood/Joppatowne were not immediately returned. No messages regarding updated plans for those communities have been posted on their respective websites or social media pages.

Humane Society of Carroll County limits public access, sends animals to foster care in response to coronavirus
.W
The Humane Society of Carroll County has implemented new procedures while staying in operation as concerns and closures relating to the coronavirus spread through the community. According to Karen Baker, executive director of the Humane Society, new policies have been put into effect to protect their employees and the public, from sending animals to foster care to canceling public events. “We have got to keep our staff going because we have animals in the building that need to be cared for,” Baker said. The center is accepting animals, but by appointment only; anyone without an appointment will not be allowed inside. March 18 was the first day that the changes went into effect. All of the center’s animals are going out to foster homes, unless they are strays or are tied to court cases, according to Kayla Bair, secretary for the Humane Society. Animals are still adoptable, but the staff urges people to foster before adopting because they are not able to browse through the Humane Society building. Anyone who chooses to foster should email mfidler@carrollcountymd.go to apply and set up their foster. Then, upon approval, they will get curbside service to get the animal and materials to provide for the animal to stick to social distancing guidelines, according to Baker. Available pets can be found on their Facebook page, at www.facebook.com/HumaneSocietyOfCarrollCounty. The whole staff is on a rotating shift for at least the next six weeks, with half working seven days and the other half off for seven days, Bair said. “We have prepared because we do realize that public loyalty coming in, and we’re going to be limited on how many animals we can get out to our adoption partners. So we have prepared for that by sending as many animals as possible out into foster care,” Baker said. “We’ve been fortunate that people have stepped up and taken animals into their homes during this time and then we’ll deal with each situation as it comes.” Changes in procedures have also affected adoption. “We do have adoption events in the community, so normally at pet stores and things like that. We do those twice a month; they have been canceled,” Baker said. They are open for adoption six days a week, excluding Sunday, but appointments must be made. They are also going to change the way they collect donations for their annual Kitten Shower scheduled for April 18; instead of having the event inside the building with games, they may ask the public to donate for the cats and the kittens that will be coming in this time of year and set up a safe donation area, according to Baker. They also need donations from the public because of a large intake of rabbits. “We have an area, there’s a table in our vestibule so that you can drop donations off and the staff is coming out throughout the day to bring those items in and sort them,” Baker said. Even though they are still taking donations, they are not accepting any previously used items. To reach someone at the Humane Society, call 410-848-4810. Animal Control, which is only handling high-priority calls, can be reached by calling that number and pressing 2, or emailing dkinna@carrollcountymd.gov.

Maurice Berger, a chief curator at UMBC and a renowned scholar, dies at 63 in New York of coronavirus complications
.W
The chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture, University of Maryland, Baltimore County died Monday in New York of complications related to coronavirus, The Jewish Museum announced Tuesday. Maurice Berger served as a research professor at UMBC in addition to being a curator, the university said in confirming his death. The university said Berger was a New York City resident and died two hours north of the city in the hamlet of Craryville in Columbia County. He was 63. Berger graduated from Hunter College and received his Ph.D. from the Graduate Center at the City University of New York. He joined the UMBC faculty in 1992, the university said, and curated over a dozen exhibits. He was known internationally as a scholar and was published regularly in The New York Times, Artforum, Art in America and National Geographic. UMBC said Berger secured major grants and awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts. One of the exhibits he curated, For All the World to See: Visual Culture and the Struggle for Civil Rights, was organized with the Smithsonian and is still on a national tour. The Jewish Museum said in a Medium post Tuesday that Berger curated Revolution of the Eye: Modern Art and the Birth of American Television at the museum in 2015. In a 2016 Baltimore Sun story, a reporter reviewing the exhibit called it “groundbreaking.” The traveling exhibit he curated explored how avant-garde art influenced and shaped the look and content of network television. Berger was described by the museum as a writer, curator and historian. “For more than 25 years, Berger was a valued colleague and friend of the Museum who passionately demonstrated the highest standards of scholarship and intellectual integrity,” the museum said. “Today we have lost him in our lives — a small consolation is that he will live on in the important and powerful work he accomplished.” Tributes to the curator flooded social media Tuesday, as news of his death began to spread. Many called him an “inspiration” and said his death was a “wake up call” for what COVID-19 can do. There are 349 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Maryland and more than 55,000 across the country. Worldwide there are more than 422,900 positive cases. More than 18,900 people have died across the world, including 796 U.S. deaths. Four, not counting Berger, have been from Maryland. Since 2012, Berger contributed monthly in the New York Times Lens Section, aiming to write “well-researched” essays in a “literary and reader-friendly” style, according to a letter from the curator on UMBC’s website. The stories won Berger an Infinity Award from the ICP in 2018. The goal of the essays was to explore the relationship of photography to concepts, themes, or social or regional issues around race not usually covered in the mainstream media, the letter said. Most of the essays focused on the civil rights era and beyond, including ways artists and photographers of color used photography to combat stereotypes and highlight ideas about race and identity in the United States. The Jewish Museum said Berger’s writing was a reflection of his personal thoughts and ethics. He frequently showed compassion for people of color, ethnic minorities, women, gay men and lesbians through his use of language. He was “driven more by questions than formulaic answers,” the museum said. His passion for sharing stories and exhibits about racism and those in the margins stemmed from Beger’s childhood, he said in an interview with the UMBC magazine in 2012. From a young age, Berger said, he noticed how minorities were treated differently from white people. Baltimore County Councilman Israel “Izzy” Patoka said in a tweet that his “heart breaks” after he learned about Berger’s death. “This is a sobering reminder of the seriousness of this public health crisis we face,” the District 2 representative said. “The virus can’t infect those it can’t reach.”

Maryland sees third coronavirus death as officials confirm 41 new cases, raising state’s total to at least 190 Saturday
.W
Maryland officials on Saturday confirmed another 41 cases of coronavirus in the state, for a total of at least 190, as well as a third death. Meanwhile, four counties reported their first cases — including a hospital worker in St. Mary’s County. Michael Ricci, a spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan, announced shortly after 11 p.m. that a Montgomery County woman in her 40s with underlying health conditions had died as a result of the virus, marking the state’s third death. Eight counties reported increases in cases from Friday to saturday. Anne Arundel County now has 15 reported cases; Baltimore City has 15; Baltimore County, 19; Charles County, 4; Howard County, 19; Montgomery County, 68; Prince George’s County, 36; and Wicomico County, 2. Montgomery reported the largest increase in cases, from 51 Friday to 68 Saturday. In addition, two counties on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, one in Western Maryland and St. Mary’s in Southern Maryland each reported their first cases, though none were reflected in the state’s total Saturday. Caroline County announced its first reported case Saturday, a woman in her 30s who lives in the Federalsburg area. She was tested Tuesday and got a positive test result Saturday. The woman had not recently traveled but had been in contact with people who had, according to Caroline County. She is resting at home, where she is self-quarantining with her family. The county did not release further details on the patient. In addition, Queen Anne’s County reported its first case on Saturday. The county said the patient is a woman in her 50s who was in stable condition. She had not recently traveled out of the country, the county said. In Western Maryland, Washington County officials announced a woman in her 50s had tested positive, was in good condition and was exhibiting mild conditions. She was isolating at home, county officials said. In Southern Maryland, St. Mary’s County officials said a Washington, D.C. resident who works at MedStar St. Mary’s Hospital had tested positive. The patient, a woman in her 40s who is isolating herself in her D.C. home, would not technically be counted as a case in the county, they said. “We are in the process of identifying potential risks to St. Mary’s County residents," said Dr. Meena Brewster, the county’s health officer, in a statement. “Our Infectious Disease team will directly contact individual community members who may have been exposed to coordinate any needed testing and monitoring for symptoms. If at any point in our investigation we feel that there was risk of broader community exposure, we will notify the public.” Holly Meyer, a MedStar spokeswoman, confirmed the employee was a member of the hospital’s medical staff, and said MedStar is now in the process of “compiling a list of all staff and patients who may have come into direct contact with the provider during the asymptomatic stage of this condition," in order to then provide them with further instructions. Meyer said the infected worker “took the important step to self-quarantine immediately when first experiencing flu-like symptoms, acting quickly to limit its potential spread.” Also, the University of Maryland reported that a part-time contractor who does work with the University Health Center and with Maryland Athletics had tested positive. University officials immediately “began notifying the individuals who we know came into direct contact with the individual” and advising them to stay home for 14 days and remain alert to possible symptoms. No additional cases of children were reported Saturday morning. The state previously reported 42 new cases on Friday, including two children, an infant and a teenager who tested positive. A 5-year-old girl in Howard County was previously reported. None of the children were hospitalized. Prior to Saturday, the state had reported two deaths — both of men in their 60s with underlying health conditions. The first was reported Wednesday in Prince George’s County and the second in Baltimore County on Friday. The majority of Maryland cases have been reported in people ages 18 to 64, officials said. On Saturday, 149 cases were in that age group, and 38 were 65 and older. The virus, which has accounted for more than 11,000 deaths worldwide, is said to be more fatal to seniors and those with compromised immune systems. On Saturday, Johns Hopkins Medicine joined other hospitals in the area and nationally in issuing new visitor guidelines to help prevent the spread of the disease within its network of regional facilities. The policy bars visitors to adult inpatient facilities except under a narrow set of circumstances — allowing two visitors for end-of-life scenarios, one visitor and a doula for labor and delivery, and one visitor for patients undergoing emergency surgery related to a traumatic event. Two visitors, including parents and legal guardians, will be allowed to accompany patients at pediatric inpatient facilities, the system said. Additional restrictions were placed on out-patient facilities. All visitors must have permission to visit from system officials. Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and has since activated the National Guard in response to the outbreak. More than 2,000 members of the Guard are expected to be called to duty statewide. On Friday, Guard units were spotted in different areas of the state, including in downtown Baltimore, where Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said Guard units were brought in to help with meal distribution and with logistical support of the city’s hospitals. Ricci said units were also reporting to FedEx Field in Prince George’s County to support a pilot assessment location, as well as other locations around the state.

Judge in Maryland weighs release of two detained immigrants because they are at high risk for the coronavirus
.W
Immigrants’ rights advocates on Thursday urged a federal judge to order the release of two people from Maryland immigration detention facilities, saying their medical conditions carry a high risk of death or serious illness from a coronavirus infection. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang didn’t immediately rule after hearing arguments from attorneys for the federal government and the two men who sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Chuang said he would issue a written decision “as soon as possible.” Judges in other states have agreed to free people from ICE detention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chuang asked plaintiffs’ attorney Sirine Shebaya if a ruling in this case could benefit any ICE detainee who has a serious medical condition. She said the lawsuit only seeks the release of these two men and that each detainee’s case must be evaluated individually. The two plaintiffs in the Maryland case have been held in civil detention at the Worcester County Detention Center and the Howard County Detention Center while awaiting resolution of their immigration cases. Practicing “social distancing” and better hygiene is impossible in crowded detention centers, plaintiffs’ lawyers claim. “Even with the measures ICE has purported to take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities, immigration detention centers are a hotbed for spread of the virus,” the March 24 lawsuit says. Neither Maryland detention center has a single confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, Justice Department attorney Vincent Vaccarella said Thursday. A “purely speculative risk” of contracting COVID-19 doesn’t entitle the plaintiffs to immediate release, Vaccarella said in a court filing this week. Federal authorities say they are taking precautions to protect inmates and staff. The judge asked Vaccarella whether the facilities could or will do more to help prevent the medically vulnerable detainees from an infection. Vaccarella said he didn’t know. “We’re not supposed to wait until someone gets sick,” the judge said during a hearing held by video conference. The Maryland plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, the Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Maryland. One of the plaintiffs, a 52-year-old citizen of El Salvador, has diabetes. The other, a 54-year-old citizen of Guatemala, has hypertension and prostate problems. They were among more than 35,000 people who were in ICE custody as of Saturday. Similar lawsuits have been filed in other states, including California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington state, according to the ACLU. Earlier this week, federal judges in California and Pennsylvania ordered ICE to release several detainees who sued. “Our Constitution and laws apply equally to the most vulnerable among us, particularly when matters of public health are at issue. This is true even for those who have lost a measure of their freedom,” U.S. District Judge John Jones III wrote in the Pennsylvania case. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and be life-threatening.

Hogan administration now says 6,000 hospital beds may not be needed for coronavirus fight
.W
After Gov. Larry Hogan announced that the state would add 6,000 hospital beds to account for a possible surge in coronavirus patients, state and hospital officials said so many beds likely won’t be necessary. That’s because Hogan also announced additional measures that should reduce the size of any surge in cases and demand for beds. “We’ve got three or four models we’re building to double check because each has its variables, and the worst case scenario we’re planning for has about 6,000 beds,” said Dennis Schrader, chief operating officer for the Maryland Department of Health, in a news conference Tuesday. “The most important thing is through the governor’s interventions, we’re looking at less than the worst case.” It’s unclear what changed overnight given that the measures undertaken by the governor either already were announced, such as school closings, or announced at the same time as the hospital bed expansion, such as the bar, restaurant, gym and theater closings. And while those restrictions largely on mass gatherings are recommended by public health experts, none has had time to show up in the case data. But Hogan reiterated the state’s commitment to add 6,000 beds as quickly as possible Wednesday on a “Morning Joe” appearance on MSNBC. He said the state’s Surge Capacity Action Team is coordinating the effort to prevent overwhelming the hospital system’s capacity. “We don’t have time to wait,” he said. Bob Atlas, president and CEO of the Maryland Hospital Association, said the situation does keep changing, and the hospitals and the governor’s administration remain in constant contact. “It was an early estimate based on the worst case scenario,” Atlas said. “The surge need is smaller, though I can’t offer a number. It’s a fluid situation.” He said the actual number of beds added would be “more than 1,000.” Any surge in cases could be weeks or months away, and the hospitals will prepare in stages. Questions remain about the ability of hospitals to absorb a rapid increase in the number of cases, especially if many require hospitalization, intensive care and ventilators to treat complications from pneumonia, which can happen as a result of COVID-19. The state’s four dozen hospitals currently have about 9,400 beds, according to state data. But that includes beds for children, birthing mothers, and surgical and psychiatric patients. The beds were 90% full, according to a recent census by the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems. Hospitals are required by their accreditation agencies to be able to boost capacity within their walls by 10% to 20%, which could mean up to 1,880 extra beds. Atlas said plans to reopen old hospitals would be problematic because they would have to be staffed. Schrader and Atlas both said more details would be provided on the bed plan in about a week. Baltimore Sun reporters Hallie Miller and Pam Wood contributed to this article.

Trump marginalized as media look for new leaders, heroes in time of coronavirus crisis | COMMENTARY
.W
Something profound has been happening during the last week or so in the relationship between Donald Trump and the press: The president is being marginalized as the media look elsewhere for leaders and heroes who can help us get through these dark days of pandemic. The cable TV news cameras, our 24/7 informational IV drip during times of crisis, are at long last moving away from Trump as they have at no time in the past four years of his reign as Republican nominee and then president. It is no accident that you are seeing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, more and more on all the cable news channels. They were even given airtime on Fox News, the network that has sold itself out so shamelessly to Trump in disseminating his false assurances and lies about the coronavirus threat before joining the president in an about-face this week when the horror of this virus could no longer be denied. This is a landmark shift as to where the public’s attention ― and potentially national consciousness ― is being directed. Those cameras have been on Trump day and night since he became the GOP front runner in 2016. Some of us in the press called for the cable channels to quit giving him so much free airtime ― worth hundreds of millions of dollars ― when he was merely a candidate. Fox News, which was designed by founder Roger Ailes as a political tool, not a journalistic enterprise, gave him all that airtime for ideological reasons: to help him get elected. But CNN and MSNBC are no less guilty, particularly the morning shows, “New Day” and “Morning Joe," which let him call in and talk non-stop for up to 30 minutes some mornings. They did it because his mix of transgressive comments, name-calling, ability to ad lib and improvise off anything they threw at him, in short, his ability to draw and hold an audience, was catnip in the ratings. It was also lazy and irresponsible programming, which played a large role in the 2016 election. Once Trump was president, you had to cover him ― cover, not obsess and so often play his game as MSNBC and CNN did even as they rightfully fact-checked and denounced many of his policies, words and actions. No matter how harsh the critiques, he was still centerstage. But this week things changed. It actually started with that dreadful March 11th address from the Oval Office when a rattled looking Trump made three mistakes that had to be corrected while reading from a prepared text as to what his administration was going to do to limit the spread of the virus. The cameras are still covering Trump’s press conferences and briefings this week; journalism demands that. He is still president, and can create major changes in American life, even if many of them are for the worse. But more and more time is being spent with Cuomo, Hogan and other elected leaders like Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City. And beyond them, medical experts like Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore City Health Commissioner and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Everyday medical workers are also rightfully being celebrated as heroes for going to work and battling the virus day in and day out. The shift away from Trump is palpable. You can feel it in your gut and see it on the screen. I saw it happen with then Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake in 2015 in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray. As the city burned with arson fires and looting of stores, Rawlings-Blake held a press conference at City Hall in which she seemed anything but in control of the situation. As a CNN headline put it at the time: “Baltimore Mayor Struggles in Response to Riots.” I wrote about cable and network reporters and producers telling me they came to town “looking for facts, answers and heroes." They said they found none of that in Rawlings-Blake. And so, they went looking for other civic leaders at which to point their cameras, like Congressman Elijah Cummings and then-state Sen. Catherine Pugh. Remember all that wall-to-wall night-time cable coverage of Cummings and Pugh standing in the streets trying to calm the situation? The media still covered announcements at City Hall, but most of the people behind the cameras knew the mayor’s City Hall briefings didn’t matter as much as what was happening with Cummings and Pugh in the evening, or with briefings from Hogan who arrived with the National Guard once he received the call from Baltimore for help. That’s a local version of what’s happening at the national level with Trump. His bombast and insults might have been entertaining in a reality-TV kind of way to people who find snark and put-downs amusing. His appearance of giving the finger to elites (even as he and his family are among them) might have even been affirming to millions of working and middle-class Americans who felt disrespected and ignored by government and media. But there is not much room for amusement when people are falling ill and dying and the man at the podium has no answers. Worse yet, he refuses to accept any responsibility for America being more poorly prepared and equipped to deal with the deadly crisis than South Korea. Looking at Trump this week, I see someone desperately making it up as he goes along, still unaware that millions of Americans now can’t help but see the disconnect between his words and the reality of their lives. But, as an entertainer, Trump can feel the cameras and the spotlight pulling away to gaze on others ― and that means marginalization for him. There is nothing a narcissist fears more than marginalization. Perhaps that’s why he held two press sessions Thursday and lashed out at the media in one of them. Both Cuomo and Hogan were on the air again Thursday morning with strong but also reassuring announcements of major steps they are taking to combat the virus. Along with their stern warnings to anyone who ignored their mandates on large gatherings, they also showed empathy and compassion not just for the victims of the virus and their families, but also the fear and anxiety of all citizens in their state who were out of work or suddenly finding their lives tremendously disrupted. Over the course of the week, CNN, MSNBC and even Fox News were all carrying Cuomo’s press conferences live, while Hogan was invited on air for segments running as long as six to ten minutes by everyone from CNN’s Wolf Blitzer to Dana Perino on Fox News. Their TV styles were different ― Cuomo seated at a long table wearing a blue business suit and dressy blue tie, Hogan standing outside at a small podium wearing an open-collared shirt and sleeveless jacket. Formal business attire vs. government command-post look. But both come across as deeply authoritative and authentic in what they had to say. Hogan shifted comfortably during his press conference from his role of Maryland’s governor to his more formal national posture as chairman of the National Governors Association. In the latter, it seemed as if he was speaking more to the White House than the citizens on Maryland. By the end of his press sessions this week, Cuomo moved from authoritative to informal and even familiar. He had his one of his daughters, a graduating college senior, at the table Thursday in hopes of reaching young people with his message of shared responsibility. This is what the “Fireside Chats” of Franklin Roosevelt look like today, I thought, as I watched the New York governor talking about the fear New Yorkers were feeling. I think we will be a better and more hopeful nation if the cameras of cable TV news continue to spend more time with leaders like Cuomo and Hogan and less with Trump. And here’s hoping they will continue to do so, even after we get through this dark moment in our national life. David Zurawik is The Sun’s media critic.

Blubaugh: As coronavirus crisis rages it’s trite but true that we’re all in this together 
.W
We wake up today to a world nearly unrecognizable from the one we took for granted only a few weeks ago. Want to go for a workout at your gym? Can’t do it. Want to go meet a friend at the coffee shop? Can’t do it. Want to go out out for dinner and a movie? Can’t do it. And those are the most minor of the inconveniences, meaningless, really, compared to the inability for many to go to work, for any to go to school, for most to keep important medical appointments. Meanwhile, we wash our hands until our skin hurts, we keep 6 feet away from all other human beings — looking askance at anyone who coughs or sneezes — and we hope against hope that no one we know and love comes down with the coronavirus, knowing full well, statistically, many probably will. My heart goes out to those afflicted, as well as to so many unable to carry on with milestones — from being able to get married in front of friends and family to celebrating important life events such as the birth of a child to properly paying tribute to and mourning the deceased. I feel for young people and all they’re missing or are likely going to miss, from outdoor school to proms to the spring sports season to high school or college graduation. But as many have pointed out, previous generations have experienced far more hardship over longer periods of time. And, of course, kids are resilient. From my very limited observations, I would suggest kids are handling it really well and, at least in my unscientific sample, seem far less stressed and anxious than I would’ve expected, but, rather, more relaxed and comfortable than usual. Yes, they miss their friends, but they have more ways than ever to stay in touch with them. What they don’t miss is those fellow students who make many of their school days so difficult to get through. Yes, they miss their sports and other extracurriculars. What they don’t miss is the ridiculous overscheduling their parents have been putting them through. If it wasn’t for the tragedy, it would be a fascinating time from a scholarly perspective. It will be written about and analyzed forever, from the effect of a significant global work shutdown on the atmosphere to the effect so much self-quarantine on crime, particularly domestic violence, to, of course, the effect the crisis will have on the 2020 presidential election. It seems wholly inappropriate to worry much about politics right now. Not with so many previously employed, hard-working people suddenly on unemployment. Not with so many small-business owners wondering if they’ll ever reopen. Not with so many seniors or soon-to-be seniors looking at their retirement savings, so sharply down, trying to convince themselves the markets will return to previous levels while cursing themselves for not having withdrawn it all last month and placed it safely under their mattresses. For some, of course, politics doesn’t take a break even in times like these. Democrats blame Republicans. Republicans blame Democrats. Everybody blames President Trump. And Trump accepts responsibility for none of it. Many of us, though, realized pretty quickly that fighting over politics is the last thing we need right now. In addition to practicing social distancing, we’re also practicing social media distancing, exceptions being made for posts designed to unite rather than divide. How many times have you heard over the past two weeks that “we’re all in this together”? It’s trite but true. That left-winger over there you used to complain about? She’s sewing masks to help alleviate that tremendous shortage. That rich right-winger you used to hate so much? He’s raising his employees’ salaries and repurposing his company to make ventilators. Those people accepting government handouts you used to criticize? They’re you in a few weeks when the stimulus checks start showing up. About all we can do is hunker down, try to get some exercise for both mind and body, be good to each other, check in with friends and family and maybe, as we wait for life to return to some sense of normalcy, binge-watch a little TV. It has been said that the Netflix series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” is doing more to get our nation through this than anything else. I wouldn’t go that far, but, then, I’m only on the fourth episode. Bob Blubaugh is the editor of the Carroll County Times. His column appears Sundays.

Patients getting stuck in state psychiatric hospitals because of coronavirus obstacles | COMMENTARY
.W
Maryland’s response to curb the spread of COVID-19 has been admirable. Gov. Larry Hogan has courageously ordered the closure of schools, child care programs and nonessential businesses. The Court of Appeals has ordered the closure of Maryland courts, permitting only designated emergency proceedings to continue and for those proceedings to be conducted remotely when possible. However, the closure of the courts complicates the plight of some people with mental illness, because the majority of patients in state psychiatric hospitals require court action in order to be discharged. Without access to the courts, patients eligible for discharge remain stuck at these facilities, which, as congregate settings, present favorable conditions for rapid spread of the virus. The virus has already begun to spread throughout state psychiatric hospitals. On some units, so many individuals have become sick that the hospital has halted further testing, assuming everyone sick has COVID-19, according to one of our clients and a family member of a patient at one of the hospitals. Hospital space is limited and, therefore, once a patient tests positive, rather than completely isolating the patient from all other patients, facilities quarantine all patients on the unit. Consequently, patients’ treatment is not only compromised due to limitations of services during the pandemic, but the placement puts many at risk of substantial harm. Every effort should be made to discharge patients so they are safe and so remaining residents may be housed more safely. Releasing patients from state facilities requires coordination of several moving parts. State facilities must first evaluate patients to determine whether they are eligible for discharge. Once a patient is deemed ready for discharge, under most circumstances, courts must review and approve the release and or any conditions associated with the release. State facilities are also required to create aftercare plans — some of which require court approval, which often depend on continued care in the community. Discharge from state hospitals and residential centers becomes virtually impossible when facilities stop evaluating patients, courts no longer conduct proceedings necessary to effectuate discharge, and community providers stop accepting patients. This is the dilemma many patients at state hospitals currently face. These problems are urgent and need to be addressed to protect patients from the inevitable spread of the virus. Rather than limiting evaluations of patients during the pandemic, state facilities should review the mental status of all patients in order to identify those who are eligible for discharge. As the first step toward discharge, such evaluations are medically necessary. Certain patients committed to state hospitals who face low-level and non-violent criminal charges, including trespass, disorderly conduct, drug possession and certain traffic offenses, should be presumed not dangerous and ready for release. Any follow-up evaluations can be conducted on an outpatient basis. Patients must also have access to courts to proceed with hearings required for their discharge. Some courts have stopped conducting competency status hearings, which forces patients, who are now competent and not dangerous, and thus ready for discharge, to remain in the hospital. Instead, courts should opt to conduct such proceedings remotely or remain flexible in conducting hearings for those patients state facilities deem eligible for release. Competency status hearings, like bail review hearings, allow patients the opportunity to demonstrate to the court that they are ready for release. Community providers should be more willing to accept patients from state facilities during the pandemic, but until they are, state facilities must explore other options. The law provides for the temporary release of patients, which allows patients to be temporarily released to family members willing to accept them until they are able to safely transition to their community program. Families should be informed of this opportunity and supported to design safe home-care plans. It is important to remember that patients are committed to state facilities for treatment — not punishment, and they should not be forgotten. Discharging patients from state hospitals is essential to protect them from the spread of the virus. Although releasing patients requires coordination and cooperation from different agencies and branches of government, it is exactly what is required by emergency management in the face of a pandemic.

Orioles’ Chris Davis believes coronavirus shutdown won’t halt progress at plate: ‘I can pick up where I left off’
.W
Orioles first baseman Chris Davis had his renaissance spring training cut short by the coronavirus pandemic that has called not only when, but if baseball season will begin into question. Whenever that comes, Davis believes the pieces are in place to continue his resurgence, and that the offseason work he’s continuing now in this post-spring training baseball void will be enough to get his career back on track. “I am confident that I can pick up where I left off,” Davis said. “I think if you’re optimistic, which I’m trying to be, I think that’s something I can look at as a positive. While I didn’t get to continue to go out there and get regular game at-bats, I know that once we start up again, I’ll have the opportunity to go back out there and get more comfortable, get more at-bats, get more of a feel for where I want to be. “But it was nice to see some results and give me a little bit of peace of mind that what I was doing this offseason really worked, and just to continue doing that. And that’s what I’ve done. I feel like, honestly, I’m still swinging the bat just as well as I was when the games ended, and I look forward to the chance whenever we can start picking it up.” Davis, who signed a seven-year, $161-million contract ahead of the 2016 season, has seen a precipitous decline at the plate over the past few years. This winter, he resolved to get physically stronger after years of trying to keep his body lean to keep it from breaking down, and came into camp with 25 pounds of new muscle. Whether it was the confidence from that strength or the strength itself, Davis performed well against spring training pitching, homering three times and walking nine times while collecting seven hits in 15 at-bats. That was enough for Davis to be able to return home once camps were closed knowing he didn’t have to do anything differently, he said. “You kind of go back into your offseason routine, for me, and that’s something that although it was short and I would have liked to have continued playing and continued to get an opportunity to go out there and just have game at-bats, it was nice to see that the work that I put in this offseason was producing some results,” Davis said. “For me, that was a positive, just nice confirmation to know that I can come back home and continue what I was doing and not have to worry about making any adjustments.” While home, Davis said he and his wife, Jill, have had to “be creative and use our imagination” to keep their three young daughters entertained, though he’s enjoying all the time with his family. He’s also keeping a bat in his hand and staying fit while keeping in touch with his teammates and coaches as much as possible. As the Orioles’ representative to the Major League Baseball Players Association, Davis said he’s been heavily involved in not only the league’s discussions with the players on how to proceed but with keeping his teammates in the loop. Perhaps that knowledge informed how uncertain he was about what he’d like the eventual season to look like, if there is one. Davis said he’s hoping the whole league doesn’t have to replicate the extraordinary game without fans at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during the 2015 unrest over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, but that’s something he’s prepared himself for. He said he wants to play as many games as possible, whenever that is, acknowledging the possibility of scheduled doubleheaders as well. “It’s a little too early to tell because there’s so many things that have to happen before we can even consider or start to discuss what a schedule looks like,” Davis said. “I’ll just try to be patient, try to stay positive and stay in a good mindset, and prepare myself to play as many games as possible. I don’t think there’s a number I could put on it that would really make me feel [good]. … Any number of games, honestly, for me is worth it.”

'Fresh air is a great antidote’: Maryland Zoo in Baltimore serves as welcome departure for life amid coronavirus fears
.W
When the gates opened Saturday at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, three families were waiting to spend a morning with the giraffes and prairie dogs. By mid-morning, some 650 persons were visiting the lions and penguins on a day when so many Baltimore attractions were closed as a precaution against spreading the new coronavirus. But the walks and valleys within Druid Hill Park seemed a safe bet to some on a cool and sunny March morning. “We’ve always wanted to come here,” said Kevin Hood, a visitor from Brownsville, New Jersey. “We usually go to the aquarium, but it was closed and this is something different.” Hood was spending a weekend in Baltimore and also visited the Horseshoe Casino, which he said was less crowded than normal, and Fogo de Chao restaurant at the Inner Harbor, which seemed busy. “I wasn’t worried coming out,” he said. Maryland Zoo in Baltimore President Donald P. Hutchinson stood at the zoo’s entrance with his wife, Peggy, and assessed the situation. “People talk with their feet,” he said. “This is one of the best walks in town. If you walk the zoo entirely, it’s three miles. Fresh air is a great antidote.” Hutchinson said the zoo was closed Friday as he and his staff assessed the situation. The restrooms and the food concession areas were deep cleaned and hand sanitizers placed on counter tops. Zoo volunteers greeted visitors and offered hand-cleaning tissues. “We are an open air venue on 150 acres of land,” he said. “I met with the staff and we decided we’d be open. Today we’ll take a measure of how it’s going. But as soon as I got here and saw the parking lot, I could tell it’s going to be a good day. But I’m going to be flexible about the situation." Hutchinson said Saturday’s attendance was made up of virtually all families traveling with children. “There are people who go about naturally as a unit. There is no overcrowding here today, and there is plenty of room to spread out,” he said. “Also, the people look as if they are happy to get out of the house.” Hutchinson said he did not expect a full house at the zoo Saturday. A week ago, the zoo saw more than 800 visitors. “But you see already that the people who have shown up want to be here,” he said. “It looks good to me.” Jim Buser and his wife Amy and two daughters arrived at the Maryland Zoo from Short Gap, West Virginia. “We are excited,” he said. “The aquarium, science center and Port Discovery were all closed. So we planned to make it a day at the zoo.” His two daughters, Evelyn and Ava, had other ideas. “Where is the carousel?" they wondered.

McCormick sees drop in sales, profit due to coronavirus impact in China and faces uncertainty this year
.W
The new coronavirus lockdown in China, a key market for McCormick & Co., pushed the global spice maker’s sales and profits down in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday. Shares slipped 1.3% Tuesday to close at $141.21 each. McCormick said its first-quarter results were significantly hurt by “the extraordinary disruption in China’s consumption related to the COVID-19 outbreak." But as the deadly virus has spread from China around the globe, the Hunt Valley manufacturer has kept its supply chain and employees working without disruption to get spice and flavorings products to retailers and food manufacturers, executives said. While business from restaurant and dining services customers has plummeted, accounting for about a fifth of overall sales, consumer demand has risen sharply, the company said. Some of that has been a result of shoppers stocking up, and food makers ramping up production, Lawrence E. Kurzius, , McCormick’s Chairman, CEO and president, said during a conference call with analysts. Beyond that short-term effect, "we expect some level of elevated demand for at-home cooking to continue, " Kurzius said. “Schools are closed. People are staying at home, and that contributes to real incremental at home consumption.” It’s too soon to predict how trends will play out. The spice maker withdrew guidance on its expected financial performance for the rest of the fiscal year, “due to the uncertainty of the duration and extend of the COVID-19. McCormick sells products to food service and restaurant customers, many of whom have shut down businesses. “I would expect that the restaurant industry impact will be pretty heavy in the second quarter, again with the complete closure of restaurants in some areas," a situation not easily offset by consumer sales, Kurzius said. He sought to assure investors that the brand is well positioned to navigate the health crisis thanks to stable cash generation, access to liquidity and mitigation plans. “McCormick is committed to maintaining critical food supply across all our markets and supporting our community,” Kurzius said. Aaron Siegel, an analyst with CFRA, said McCormick could see more of an effect from the virus than its spice maker competitors because 20 percent of its sales come from restaurants and dining services. “However, we believe [McCormick] is well positioned to navigate through these turbulent times,” Siegel said in a report Tuesday. The company said it gained insight into how the spread of the virus could unfold in the U.S. and elsewhere after seeing its impact in China, where the virus started. Typically, the start of the year is a peak season for McCormick in the Chinese market, but instead residents there were in extended lockdowns with no opportunities to stock their pantries. Consumer sales throughout the Asia/Pacific region plummeted 29 percent in the quarter. During the three months that ended Feb. 29, McCormick’s sales fell 2% to $1.21 billion compared with $1.23 billion in the first three months of last year. Net income declined to $144.7 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with $148 million, or $1.11 each. China has entered the early recovery stage, with lockdowns lifted or soon to be lifted, restaurants starting to re-open and consumer confidence slowing coming back, Kurzius said.

5 carryout meals from Baltimore eateries to get you through the coronavirus pandemic
.W
These days, food carryout and delivery provides perhaps the single greatest refuge to what can feel like an endless stream of bad news. (Netflix comes a close second.) With restaurants closed to dine-in service, carryout can also be small way to support local businesses hurting from the statewide shutdown. That said, I’ve heard from people who don’t want to order either carryout or delivery during the pandemic, despite health experts saying it’s safe to do so. (There have been no cases of foodborne transmission of the coronavirus, although if someone in your household is showing symptoms, take care when sharing a meal with them). I encourage everyone to eat as they feel comfortable. Food should be restorative, not another source of stress. Here are some meals we’re loving lately. Most places offer no-contact delivery and encourage customers to pay online. Call ahead, as hours and days of operation are subject to change. Himalayan House When food is made with care, it shows — and a recent feast delivered by South Baltimore’s Himalayan House was a wondrous example of that. Among the highlights: A smoky and well-seasoned biagan bhartha ($11.99), or eggplant mash, that was the hit of the newsroom (back when we were still in the office). Steamed vegetable momo dumplings ($7.99) made me say “Oh, I’ll just have one more,” one too many times. Mulligatawny soup ($3.99) proved a filling and comforting starter, if just a touch too salty. 1522 E Fort Ave., Locust Point. 410-528-1271. thehimalayanhouse.com. The Avenue Kitchen & Bar Carryout often translates into heavy and fried, but a recent meal from the Avenue Kitchen and bar tasted light and healthy enough for a somewhat guilt-free weeknight meal. To start, try the grilled octopus ($15) with red quinoa salad and grapefruit segments, a zesty and refreshing combination. Like a few other places such as Wicked Sisters on Falls Road and Noona’s in Bolton Hill, the Hampden restaurant is also offering family-sized meals. Offerings include steak, chicken or veggie fajitas (2 for $30 or 4 for $50). 911 W 36th St., Hampden. 443-961-8515. avenuekitchenbar.com. Byblos Lebanese Cuisine The teensy cafe in Federal Hill is a regular haunt of mine during non-pandemic times, and a carryout order from here provided a taste of normalcy — if only for a moment. Dishes like fresh made tabbouleh, hummus and foul, a fava bean stew served cold, make great snacks to keep in your fridge during the week. Best of all is a cup of cardamom-infused Lebanese coffee, paired with a slice of nutty baklava for a sweet (but not too sweet) afternoon pick me up. 1033 Light St., Federal Hill. 410-209-2495. bybloslebanesecuisine.com. Well Crafted Kitchen This Medfield eatery specializes in pizza — they even sell make-your-own kits, which at $19 for 2, sounds like a great way to stave off the stir crazy. During a recent visit I opted to try their locally sourced spud skillet ($8.50), which sees seasoned sweet potatoes topped with cheddar and chorizo. Guess what? Local, sort of healthy food can also be incredibly delicious. Tack on to your order a 6-pack of beer from Union Craft Brewing, a pint of ice cream from neighboring Charmery or even a dozen fresh eggs from Kitchen Girl Farm near Cockeysville. 1700 W. 41st St., Medfield. 410-929-4547. wellcraftedkitchen.com. Red Pepper Sichuan Bistro Sichuan peppers can help you forget the problems of the world, and focus instead on the intense numbing and delicious sensation happening in your mouth. Few places in Baltimore make better use of the little flavor bombs than Towson’s Red Pepper Sichuan Bistro, where you can find them on spicy prawns, a house specialty, ($21.95) and dan dan noodles with minced pork ($8.95), which I like to think of as the ultimate in carbo-loading comfort food. Start off with garlicky eggplant ($13.95) or a side of sauteed green beans ($13.95) and revel in your leftovers. 11 Allegheny Ave., Towson. 410-832-7333. redpeppermd.com.

‘It is uncharted territory’: Two-week closure due to the coronavirus forces schools to find ways to maintain instruction
.W
Maryland’s top education official has ordered all public schools to close for two weeks beginning Monday in an unprecedented move that leaves administrators rushing to prepare plans to feed students, rethink testing and worry about hourly workers who might not be paid. The action, announced at Gov. Larry Hogan’s press conference on Thursday evening, drew praise from teachers and parents who said there is broad anxiety in the community about the spread of COVID-19. “We are appreciative that the governor and legislature is taking the lead and making sure there are precautions to protect the health and the safety of our communities,” said Cheryl Bost, the president of the Maryland State Education Association, the union representing the majority of the state’s teachers. The governor recommended all private schools close as well, and one after another schools quickly announced closings, including all Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Maryland has not ordered schools to close for more than a day in recent memory. It is only the second state in the nation to take this action because of the coronavirus. Friday, the District of Columbia announced schools would close for at least two weeks, joining Maryland and four other states. In states harder hit by the virus, such as Washington state, only some counties have closed. Maryland State Superintendent Karen Salmon has suggested that school systems keep schools open during spring break, which for many students is April 6th through April 13. If that happens, then students would only lose about four days of school, an interruption not greater than a long winter snow storm. However, there were hints that the closure could extend far longer. In a statement, Salmon said administrators, faculty, staff and parents should “begin to prepare for and implement measures for the continuity of educational services during a prolonged period.” Sending home a million school children will disrupt the lives of thousands of workers who must find child care or miss work to stay home. And so the state education department is developing plans to make sure that the children of emergency services personnel have access to childcare. How that will happen in the next three days is unclear and Salmon declined to be interviewed. "We don’t know what the future will bring. We are out for two weeks. Is that the end of it or will it be longer,” said Baltimore County Superintendent Darryl Williams. Lots of questions remain to be answered, he said, about graduation or spring athletics or testing. “We don’t have those particulars. We are really taking it day by day.” The county schools also canceled all field trips and athletic events starting Friday until further notice, according to a phone call home to parents. A number of questions remained about how the effects of a prolonged closure of state public schools might effect children and their parents. The number one issue for most educators was feeding students who are regularly served breakfast and lunch at school. In Baltimore City and Baltimore County, alone, about 100,000 students depend on those meals. Shantay Jackson, whose son is a senior at Mergenthaler Vocational Technical High School in Baltimore, said it’s vital the district find a way to continue feeding students. While she’s concerned about students losing classroom time, Jackson said the immediate focus must be on ensuring families can find daycare, that homeless students are taken care of and free meals are distributed. “This isn’t a game to be played,” she said. “We’re talking about people’s lives.” Bost said she’s concerned that children have their basic needs taken care of and are not left alone while parents work. She’s also concerned that the thousands of hourly workers in schools are paid even if they aren’t doing their jobs. “It is uncharted territory that we have never been in before,” Bost said, adding she wants to help people who could lose pay and potentially lose their houses. A prolonged closure she said would be “devastating” for the education of children, but she said teachers were growing concerned about the potential of being exposed to the virus in their classrooms. Children have shown to be less affected by the virus. The two-week closure also covers the start of state testing and an SAT exam day, according to Bost. Williams said the break allows the school system to deep clean buses and school buildings. In addition, it may calm the “rumors and disinformation.” Children will be fed, he said, and the county is now working on the logistics. He said they will likely use the same routine used during the summer months, but in a carry-out form that children and families can pick up. And hourly workers may have plenty of work, he said, because they will be needed for cleaning and food preparation. The federal government is expected to give some leeway to school systems that close down because of the coronavirus. On Thursday, the federal education department issued guidance saying it would consider one-year waivers from state testing, and that schools might not need to provide special education students services while closed. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Warner I. Sumpter, the president of the Maryland State School Board, said Salmon had consulted the board leadership before the announcement was made at the governor’s press conference. “It is the right thing to do as a precaution rather than be sorry later,” he said. While schools are closed, the buildings and buses will be cleaned and disinfected. Jackson said she was relieved the state superintendent made a blanket decision for all of Maryland’s 24 school districts. “It’s a demonstration of the commitment to keeping all our kids safe,” said Jackson, a former Baltimore Parent Community Advisory Board leader. “Having this unified message is something that’s really important.” Jackson said she can tell there’s been a shift in how people are thinking about this new coronavirus, even just in conversations with her son. A week ago, he and many other people felt COVID-19 wasn’t something to worry about. Now, he’s having conversations with his friends about travel bans and widespread cancellations. “You can hear a sense of urgency in the conversations that our young people are having,” she said.

As coronavirus pandemic unfolds, Baltimore County residents turn to creative endeavors to deal with distress
.W
Creating art had always been a respite for Pattie Archuleta. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety in her 30s, Archuleta channeled her feelings into creativity. Using found objects — usually discarded materials with a non-art function — the Catonsville resident would piece together collages and mosaics. There are “a lot of outside factors that impact … my own ability to navigate my mental health,” Archuleta said. “After holding it together for so long, you just have to fall apart so you can put the pieces back together.” That’s the thought process behind her mosaics, she said: “These broken pieces that have come apart and then come back together again in a really beautiful way.” As Archuleta raised her son and engrossed herself in her work at Maryland Coalition of Families, her creative outlet fell by the wayside, she said. Since the coronavirus outbreak began sweeping through the U.S. at the end of February, Archuleta has found solace in her artwork again. “You go through it just hoping for the best, but knowing there’s going to be loss,” Archuleta said. “Great loss.” The novel COVID-19 virus has combined such numerous mental health stressors that psychologists say the pandemic is inflicting trauma on an unprecedented global scale. The diagnostic criteria for trauma in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, used by the American Psychiatric Association, are "exposure to actual or threat of death, serious injury [and] sexual violence,” said Dr. Bethany Brand, a Towson University professor and psychologist specializing in trauma treatment. “Clearly, people are being exposed right now to actual and threat of death,” Brand said. “That is one possibility with COVID.” Collective anxiety over the fear of losing a loved one or contracting the illness is compounded by the reality of millions rapidly losing their jobs and a volatile economy with no clear end in sight. As Marylanders adjust to Gov. Larry Hogan’s stay-at-home orders, residents are also losing “a respite for life stressors,” Brand said. Human connection helps “people normally feel settled or connected,” Brand said. “And now we can’t do that.” Those with pre-existing physical and mental illnesses and substance abuse problems, those who have lost their jobs and those whose work puts them in the throes of the pandemic are most vulnerable to the emotional distress the virus is causing, Brand said. Despite the added stress, therapy patients are canceling sessions and new patient referrals have dropped, said Dr. Julie Bindeman, who runs a private practice in Rockville. The reason for that is economic uncertainty and the fear or reality of losing work and insurance coverage, Bindeman said. Using the 2008 recession as a precedent, Bindeman said she expects “a huge influx” to return as mental health professionals explore ways to work with insurance companies to lower deductibles and offer discounted fee-for-service rates. Pete Fitzpatrick is used to working 50-hour weeks as a nurse with a pediatric transport team at a D.C. hospital. Now, working 60 to 70 hours a week has become typical. Chronic stress “comes with the job,” he said. “Working in pediatrics, it is sometimes extraordinarily sad. You’re in close contact with a lot of the worst things you’ll ever see in the world. But that’s like our norm, and this is adding on top of that.” The Catonsville resident said his anxiety is threefold: He worries about the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients, keeping the staff of 50 clinicians he supervises safe, and about what will happen if he contracts the virus. Taking time off work, he said, would only exacerbate those concerns. “I’m not so worried for my own health reasons … I’m worried I’m gonna get sick and get put out of the fight,” he said. That anxiety can manifest in myriad ways. It tends to cause problems with sleep, “with feeling safe in their daily lives,” which can lead to irritability and increased emotional reactivity, Brand said. Reports of domestic abuse will likely rise amid the pandemic, she added. Some may have trouble finding motivation to even get out of bed. Others might glom onto media coverage and ruminate obsessively, Brand said. The fear can lead to muscle tension, stomach upset and, with a lack of exercise and restless sleep, can impair one’s immune system, she said. How to cope To manage the stress, psychologists recommend creating rituals to maintain a sense of stability, said Dr. Bruce Herman, director of health services and the counseling center at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “Finding things that give you a sense of meaning, a sense of normalcy ... all those things are going to be especially important,” Herman said. For those working at home, Brand recommends taking breaks throughout the day to work on something creative or do a soothing activity like deep-breathing exercises. Making time to video chat with friends can alleviate the feeling of isolation as residents are sequestered in their homes. Having a creative outlet like cooking, sewing or listening to music, and feeling a sense of control can also offer some respite, she said. For Brand, that outlet has been gardening. “To make something beautiful and alive in my yard was incredibly important,” she said. Fitzpatrick, to decompress, works on a sprawling Lego city with his son. For Archuleta, assisting others in dealing with their own mental health needs has helped. “I have the skills to navigate [emotional distress], and I also have the skills to help other people navigate it, which is important to me,” she said. “That’s something that makes me feel really empowered, is empowering others.” Psychologists also recommend unplugging from social media and limiting the time they spend watching or reading the news. “It’s about finding a balance between keeping yourself informed and keeping yourself safe and healthy without being overwhelmed,” Herman said. Fitzpatrick, a self-described news junkie, said he’s limited his media consumption to an hour a day. He’s found comfort, he said, in the support of his friends and neighbors who check in on him or have offered to go grocery shopping for his family of five. “It’s just been illuminating,” he said. “if there’s an upside to this, it’s that.”

‘Hard Knocks’ and title fights: A streaming guide for Ravens fans waiting out the coronavirus
.W
You’re stuck at home, bored, not cool enough to figure out what a TikTok is. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing might as well be your middle name. You can’t go to the gym, can’t go to the movie theater, can’t stand to hear anyone cough without seeing your life flash before your eyes. So you turn to ESPN, then Netflix, then Hulu and Amazon Prime and Disney Plus. You scroll and scroll. Nothing catches your eye. You envy the friends and family members who have a dog. Suddenly, you remember — the Ravens! The NFL season might be long over, and most of the top free agents already know where they’re going, but YouTube — well, YouTube never forgets. From game broadcasts to training camp footage to informative breakdowns, there’s enough streaming content available to make you forget about the national emergency and the 5 pounds you’ve already packed on. When you come to grips with the fact that it’s OK to watch something besides “The Office,” here are a few options worth your time. For the Ravens fan who wants to party like it’s 2012 (or 2001) “Super Bowl XLVII: ‘The Harbaugh Bowl’ aka ‘The Blackout’ | Ravens vs. 49ers | NFL Full Game" (2 hours, 39 minutes) The bad Harbaugh puns, the early Ravens lead, the midgame power outage, the second-half 49ers rally, the goal-line stand, the postgame interviews — this full-length broadcast of the Ravens’ last NFL championship has everything but the commercials. (OK, so it doesn’t have everything: You’ll have to look elsewhere for Beyonce’s memorable halftime show.) If you’ve got another three hours to burn, the Super Bowl XXXV broadcast is also available. For the Ravens fan feeling nostalgic for Joe Flacco “Flacco’s Hail Mary | Ravens vs. Broncos 2012 AFC Divisional Playoffs | NFL Full Game” (2 hours, 42 minutes) Sorry, Rahim Moore. Lest we forget, maybe the most memorable performance of Flacco’s career — 331 passing yards and three touchdowns against the top-seeded Broncos in freezing-cold Denver — didn’t end with his 70-yard shot to Jacoby Jones, or even in the first overtime period. It wasn’t until the Ravens’ third overtime possession that kicker Justin Tucker nailed his game-winning 47-yard field goal. Which means there’s a lot to watch. If you’ve memorized that game by now, go one season back for more vintage Flacco. Two under-the-radar candidates: a Week 1 home blowout of the Steelers in 2011, or a last-second Week 9 rally at Pittsburgh later that season. For the Ravens fan who never got to know Tony Siragusa “The First Ever Hard Knocks Episode | 2001 Baltimore Ravens Episode 1 | NFL Vault” (52 minutes) The Ravens have been featured on HBO’s “Hard Knocks” just once — in 2001, as the defending Super Bowl champions and guinea pigs for the cinéma vérité docuseries. The idea of embedding with a team through training camp was so novel that NFL Films paid veterans like Ray Lewis and Rod Woodson $8,000 to cooperate. The resulting six episodes, all available on YouTube, established a compelling template for the long-running series. There are Shannon Sharpe impressions and shots of Todd Heap shopping for a cellphone and so many bucket hats. There’s also Tony Siragusa. "Why do guys go to BYU?" the Ravens defensive tackle asks a coaching intern in the premiere. "Why do we go to BYU?" responds the poor intern, who starts to respond before he’s cut off. "You can't have chicks in your room. You've got to have both feet on the floor when you have a girl in your room. Can't drink. Why do you go to college? To study? You actually study?" “Yeah.” For the Ravens fan who couldn’t make it to church “Unexpected | Ray Lewis | TEDxYouth@VHS” (22 minutes) These are tough times. People are dying, the economy is sinking, social distancing is distressing. The future is uncertain. If you need a pick-me-up, consider this 2016 TED Talk. As with most Lewis productions, it’s not for everyone — the speech is essentially a sermon inspired by his football career, the good times and the bad — but the themes are universal. “Learn to appreciate the occasional storms that come in your life,” Lewis says at the end. “That’s the ingredient of how you really deal with pain.” For the still-scarred Ravens fan “What Happened to Lamar Jackson? Ravens vs Titans Playoffs” (43 minutes) If you’ve ever found yourself wishing NFL Network Brian Baldinger’s film breakdowns had just a little bit higher production values and a much longer runtime, look no further than J.T. O’Sullivan’s YouTube channel, “The QB School.” With the wisdom of a former journeyman NFL quarterback and the accessible coherence of a current high school football coach, O’Sullivan breaks down everything from the Wonderlic test to offensive game plans to passing-game route combinations. Last season, Jackson’s play was a popular subject. Unfortunately for Ravens fans, O’Sullivan’s longest video yet on the reigning NFL Most Valuable Player will also be the hardest to watch: an extensive analysis of Jackson’s highs and lows in the Ravens’ season-ending playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans. If you have the stomach to watch all 43 minutes, you’ll come out a lot more informed on just what went wrong. If you don’t, O’Sullivan has far more ecstatic options. For the Ravens fan with a Browns fan in their life “Every Browns Penalty from Week 1 | NFL 2019 Highlights” (5 minutes) Because sometimes you just need to laugh. Honorable mention “How Orlando Brown Jr. is Walking in Orlando “Zeus” Brown’s Footsteps | NFL Films Presents”: An NFL Films feature on the Ravens’ starting right tackle and his father’s legacy.  “Match Game PM (Episode 97) (Meet Contestant: Brian Billick) (Former Ravens NFL Coach)”: Yes, that is a young Brian Billick competing in the old game show — poorly — while Richard Dawson roasts him.  “Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson explains why he’s still out to prove doubters wrong | NBC Sports”: Jackson rarely does one-on-one interviews, which makes this extensive chat with NBC’s Mike Tirico, done before the Ravens’ win over the New England Patriots last season, so interesting.  “EVERYTHING That Goes into the Final 24 Hours of Stadium Preparation for an NFL Game Day”: A behind-the-scenes look at M&T Bank Stadium ahead of the Ravens’ Week 15 game against the New York Jets.

Baltimore Council President Scott calls for $25M in rainy day funds to be used on coronavirus response
.W
Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott called for the city to use $25 million from its rainy day fund to support small businesses, laid-off workers and homeless people as they cope with the coronavirus pandemic. The city’s fund is “meant for emergencies like this one,” Scott said. “When you’re in a crisis like this, you have to consider everything.” Scott rolled out a 17-page policy paper for how he proposes the city support residents as they grapple with the long-term impacts of COVID-19. He is running for mayor in a crowded Democratic primary election that was postponed to June 2 because of safety concerns. “This is a public health emergency unlike we’ve ever seen,” he said during a virtual press conference. “This document lays the groundwork for a successful and equitable recovery for Baltimore.” Lester Davis, a spokesman for Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, said the administration is in talks with the finance department about how to best use city resources to blunt the economic blow, and that nothing is off the table. Baltimore officials expect to end the fiscal year with a $42.3 million deficit as the virus stifles economic activity. They are also forecasting that the city will bring in about $100 million less in revenue than anticipated for the fiscal year that begins in July. The finance department is in the process of reworking the budget to account for economic turmoil sparked by the coronavirus. Officials are also monitoring federal coronavirus relief legislation to determine what emergency resources the city can unlock. “We have to be very judicious in the use of the rainy day fund,” finance director Henry Raymond said during a Tuesday news conference. “In the coming days, we’ll make those decisions about what potential expenses should be used against the rainy day fund.” Young said during the news conference that the City Council is making a slew of requests without having a sense of what the budget will look like. During their meeting Monday, the council passed a resolution with several recommendations for the city’s response. “Our budget don’t look good in this pandemic,” Young said. “We have to be reasonable and not political about this.” Scott is proposing the city use $3 million from the rainy day fund to help people experiencing homelessness secure safe spaces to self-quarantine. Young’s office says it has started to move 150 “vulnerable, but healthy, individuals” over the age of 62 from its emergency shelters to motels, but homeless advocates say it could take five times as many rooms to adequately address the problem. The council president’s policy proposal also calls for $10 million from the rainy day fund to create a small business loan fund and $4 million support nonprofits and cultural centers. And he is asking for $8 million to be used on workforce development to help the thousands of employees who have been laid off. State lawmakers last month passed an emergency bill that allows Republican Gov. Larry Hogan to take up to $50 million out of the state’s rainy day fund to respond to coronavirus. City officials are also in discussions about whether they can use the Children and Youth Fund to meet the immediate needs of young people during the crisis, specifically food insecurity and a lack of technology necessary for online school. The youth fund, authorized by voters in 2016, sets aside a portion of the city’s budget each year to provide grants to grassroots organizations in the city working with children. “I believe in its mission of supporting small, grassroots nonprofits,” Scott wrote. “But its mission can and should be adapted to meet the present need: providing meals for youth, obtaining laptops and tablets to aid young people with digital learning, and support non-profit organizations that directly serve youth during this public health emergency.” Davis said the administration has been in talks with the finance and law departments about how to potentially use money from the youth fund to help children impacted by school closures, while also “not jeopardizing the integrity of the fund.” He recalled that when the fund was first created, supporters decided “it had to be nimble enough to be responsive to the need of the day.” The 2021 budget proposal includes $3.5 million in additional funding for the Children and Youth Fund. Political analysts say the coronavirus pandemic will test current elected officials who are running for office, while presenting other candidates the chance to argue why they’re the right person to lead the city through a crisis. Former state Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah called Scott’s proposal “woefully inadequate," with his suggestion to use $25 million from the rainy day fund representing just a “drop in the bucket." He said that his campaign would be putting out a comprehensive coronavirus response plan within the next week. Also running in the Democratic primary are former Mayor Sheila Dixon, former Baltimore Police spokesman T.J. Smith and former U.S. Treasury official Mary Miller.

Baltimore restaurants stock up on and sell grocery items after supermarket shortages due to coronavirus
.W
A week ago, after a failed trip to his local supermarket where he was able to retrieve only 20% of what was on his list, Josh Brown had an idea. He would work with his contacts through the Severna Park location of his business, Vida Taco Bar, and begin offering customers harder-to-get grocery items such as toilet paper, fresh produce and meat, while they picked up carryout tacos and margaritas. The concept was a hit. “We saw about 500 people in the three days that we were open,” he said. “Our sales matched a normal weekend. We were absolutely floored by it. It was amazing because the community came out and supported us. We had a line of 60 people deep at some point on Saturday.” As the COVID-19 crisis has wreaked havoc on national and local businesses, some in the restaurant industry have tweaked their business model and started selling grocery store items that are in high demand. The change in approach has helped them maintain relationships with their customers and their purveyors. It has also allowed them to remain open and employ some staff while economic uncertainty looms. The trend is popping up throughout the region. Atwaters has been advertising through social media that most of its locations will sell eggs, milk and bread for both curbside pickup and through Ubereats and Grubhub. Fogo de Chao, the Brazilian steakhouse known for its endless servings of meats, is now selling ready-to grill cuts of meat with free delivery for orders more than $50. La Cuchara, the Clipper Mill restaurant usually known for its popular happy hours and Basque cuisine, has switched over to a marketplace approach where customers can order eggs, milk, produce, meats and fresh seafood as well as “scarce” household products delivered to cars by employees wearing gloves. “We pretty much ran out of everything on Sunday night,” Brown explained. Restaurant owners are utilizing existing relationship they have with farms and wholesale suppliers to sell these goods directly to customers. “I have re-upped all of our orders.” Phil Han, owner of Dooby’s, a coffee shop that also sells food with Asian flair, and Noona’s, an Italian-themed restaurant known for its pizza and pasta, has begun selling grocery items at both businesses. At Noona’s, Han now sells milk, butter and assorted boxes of up to 20 pieces of produce and other perishable items from John Shaw Karma Farm in Monkton for $35; Kitchen Girl Farm eggs, flour and other grains, bread and pastas, and various fresh meats such as Roseda ground beef, NY strip steak and organic boneless skinless chicken breast. At Dooby’s, Han sells eggs. In the first week, Han was able to sell 60 dozen eggs and 30 produce boxes to customers who were also coming to the restaurant to pick up carryout food items. “We took a complete 180 approach to our business model,” he said. This new approach has provided an additional resource to the customers of Bolton Hill and Mount Vernon, Han said, but also to help local farmers, who will be able to continue selling their goods to restaurants. “Restaurants and bars were some of the first things that were talked about. But it is good to add farms to the conversation,” he said. “This way, customers are getting [grocery items] faster than if they got delivery from Whole Foods.” The new dimension to the business model is keeping restaurants afloat, owners say. It also keeps some employees working. At Vida Taco Bar, Brown has been working with a “skeleton crew” of all his managers (five) and two hourly employees. “Our goal is, once we figure out operations, we will start bringing in hourly employees so they can get cash as well. We will rotate as many staff possible,” he explained. Ryan Reesey, who works as a shift manager and server for the company, is grateful for the work. “It feels wonderful to be a part of this team. And to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. The responses have been great,” he said. In the beginning, Reesey was nervous about the fate of his job with all the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 crisis. “We still didn’t know what we were going to do the next week," he said. "We were flying by the seat of our pants. Now we feel energized. We’re all excited to go in. To give back.” At Chuck’s Trading Post, a Hampden restaurant that owner Tracey Sangria describes as part “bodega,” selling grocery items has allowed the small business to remain open. “I get to restock and keep using my suppliers,” said Sangria, who is typically whipping up shrimp and grits, honey-sweet cornbread in individualized skillet and an array of burgers —especially on Wednesday when a burger, fries and a can of beer are $12. “I was able to retain a little more than half my staff, which was great.” About a week ago, Sangria moved up the produce display, which was typically in the back of the restaurant near wall coolers filled with beer, wine, milk and eggs. “We always had grocery items,” Sangria said. “I just expanded it” Sangria said that the past weekend she did half the business she typically does with restaurant sales. But “curbside tips,” gift card sales, grocery sales and wine and beer helped to make it a successful weekend. Laura Spicer, a Hampden resident who frequents Chuck’s Trading Post, has been back to the restaurant three times in the past week picking up items such as bones to make stock for her chicken tortellini soup, a pack of Zeke’s Coffee, a bottle of wine and breakfast sandwiches. “What I like about Chuck’s is that she [Sangria] has been stocking grocery items and she’ll specialty order me things,” Spicer said about the chicken bones. ” Besides the convenience — the restaurant is around the corner from Spicer’s house — it’s far less crowded, which is a plus for the policy analyst. “It’s much nicer to call up to Chuck’s to run in and run out and get what you need,” she explained. “It definitely feels safer.” Restaurant owners are already looking for ways to further adjust to the new realities of business in a world affected by the coronavirus. Sangria said she is toying with some other ways to further expand the restaurant’s offerings to better serve the needs of customers. Currently, that includes eventually selling toilet paper. Brown, of Vida Taco Bar, is exploring the possibility of opening a farmers’ market at the location once the business returns to regular service. “That’s just an idea,” he quickly said. “We want to get through this first. ” Han has already started offering family-style meals to go, which he said is in response to customers being more cost-conscious. He added that he has some things in the works —but he won’t discuss them just yet. He’s also paying attention to what customers will do after the COVID-19 crisis has been solved. “We can’t be too hyper-focused that far in advance,” he said. “If we get to that point, we’ll find a way to adapt again. Hopefully we’ll be a part of that conversation with our guests. It’s all part of the education process.”

More Maryland residents who took Egyptian cruises test positive for coronavirus, bringing state’s case total to nine
.W
Three more Marylanders who took Nile River cruises recently tested positive for the novel coronavirus Tuesday, bringing the state’s total case count to nine people, state officials said. They now include a woman in her 60s from Montgomery County and a couple in their 50s from Prince George’s County. The three were among a group of six state residents that health officials reached out to because they took cruises on the same ship that was tied to Maryland’s first three cases of COVID-19, announced last week. No information was immediately available about whether they might have exposed anyone else to the virus. Late Monday, officials also revealed that a Prince George’s County woman in her 50s contracted the virus during a Feb. 25-27 trip to Boston. Officials said that, according to an initial investigation into her case by the Maryland Department of Health, there are no major concerns for exposure risk to the community and that there is no connection to other positive cases. The patient is at home and in good condition, according to Gov. Larry Hogan’s office. Her family is also quarantined, Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said. That brings the state’s county-by-county totals to five in Montgomery, three in Prince George’s and one in Harford County. To prevent further spread of the virus, Hogan said Tuesday that the state is recommending nursing homes and retirement communities take further precautions to protect residents and is asking students at University System of Maryland institutions to prepare to stay home two weeks or more beyond their upcoming spring break. The University of Maryland Medical System said Tuesday that visitors to its 13 hospitals and other health care facilities will be screened and limited in an effort to keep the virus at bay. The outbreak already is affecting workplaces, too. As a precaution, after one employee at the state Attorney General’s central office in Baltimore “fell ill recently,” the staff there were asked to work from home, spokeswoman Raquel Coombs said Tuesday. “There have been no confirmed cases of any employee having the virus,” she added. As many as 100 people a day can now be tested for the coronavirus in Maryland, and the state has a stockpile of about 800 test kits, said Fran Phillips, the state’s deputy health secretary for public health. Initial tests were sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The number of available test kits is growing, with an order for 1,000 more for the lab, Phillips said. Still, the state is struggling with the logistics of testing Marylanders and expanding testing capacity, state Health Secretary Robert Neall told the University System of Maryland Board of Regents on Tuesday. With more people needing testing, officials in the state, like their counterparts across the nation, have been trying to have tests performed in private labs as well. “Quest and LabCorp have initiated capacity,” Neall said of the nation’s largest public lab companies. “We have not solved all the problems about where to get tested and who is testing you.” Neall said he hopes to have testing up to speed when the virus begins spreading in the community. Several of Maryland’s federal lawmakers said Tuesday that while they believe the state will soon have adequate testing capacity, they were frustrated residents generally don’t know how to get tested. “The biggest issue — and I think the one that’s on the minds of our constituents — is if you feel like you’re experiencing these symptoms, how do you get tested?” U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said. Hogan said the state has not faced any shortage of tests, despite concerns that early federal rules on testing drastically limited who was eligible for screening. “We’re going to be dramatically widening the number of people that will be able to get tested,” the governor said. “It hasn’t been an issue, and hopefully will not.” As testing expands, case counts are expected to continue to rise. There were 1 million test kits available across the country on Monday, and that number is expected to quadruple by the end of the week, Hogan said. “It is going to get worse before it gets better,” he said.

Towson boys, girls lacrosse and softball teams in limbo because of coronavirus
.W
High school sports may be in purgatory after Gov. Larry Hogan closed all Maryland schools on March 12, but coaches from three teams at Towson High won’t forget the memories from the pre-season practices and scrimmages that gave them hope before the pandemic coronavirus put all sports on the bench. Here’s a preview of the Towson boys and girls lacrosse teams and Towson’s defending Baltimore County championship softball team as they wait to hear if classes will resume and sports resume. Brocato comes out of retirement for Towson boys lacrosse At Towson High, new boys lacrosse coach Rick Brocato came out of retirement to coach at the school he graduated from in 1981. Brocato stepped down from coaching lacrosse at St. Paul’s in 2017 after 17 seasons, leaving as the program’s all-time wins leader with 241. His team’s first scrimmage was Thursday, March 12, the same day Hogan announced mandatory closing of schools and suspension of athletics. “We had our first scrimmage against Manchester Valley on Thursday and going into the locker room there wasn’t going to be a Friday,” Brocato said. “At least we got a scrimmage in and we got 10 practices in.” The team was almost completely set and Brocato only wanted to see how some injured players performed. That may never happen. “It’s disappointing, really disappointing, I love my coaching staff, four of the five of us are Towson alums,” said Brocato, noting the other coach is a Calvert Hall alum he has coached against. “We hadn’t even handed out uniforms or anything like that.” Brocato had two stints at St. Paul’s (1995-1999, 2006-2017) and won a Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association A Conference title in 2010. He felt this year’s Towson squad could have had a solid postseason. “We have a good group of kids, but we are nowhere near as talented as Towson has been the last couple of years,” he said. “We graduated 19 seniors this past year and the year before they graduated a strong senior class as well, but I think it’s a group that could definitely improve and make some waves.” He cited Hereford, Dulaney and Catonsville as teams that could challenge for county titles. “That Catonsville team is going to be good for several years I think,” said Brocato, who replaced Shawn Burke after his three years at the helm. Last year, Towson finished 13-4 and won a regional crown before losing to Northern in the state semifinals. The 2020 pre-season roster includes senior captains Jaydyn Castillo and Jack Carter. Castillo is a three-year varsity midfielder who will play at State University of New York at Cortland next year. Carter is another three-year varsity veteran who will play attack at Randolph Macon University in 2021. Longstick middie Ryan Tyler is also a three-year player. “Those are our three solid seniors who would have really played a lot,” Brocato said. Two other captains are junior attackers Evan Brown and Colin Hughes. “He (Brown) is probably our best offensive player,” said Brocato, noting Hughes played on varsity as a sophomore. Junior Mason Cloyd played attack last year and was expected to be back from illness on April 3. “He is another guy that we were hoping that we could count on down the line,” Brocato said. Junior defensive captain Joe Murray was paired with classmates Max Osbourne and Riley Wagner on defense. “He (Watson) is probably our best defensive player, he is terrific,” Brocato said. Goalie was the one key position left up in the air when the pre-season was halted. The junior candidates were right-handed Michael Giordani, and southpaw Jack Skeen. “We were even thinking about splitting time between the two of them,” Brocato said. “They are both very good goalies.” When schools closed, several players inquired about holding practices and they were denied. “I think all the team’s wanted to have what they call captain’s practices, to get the kids together, but the MPSSAA has told us please do not do that, so all the athletic directors and coaches have really had to lay the law down with the kids that they can’t do that if we are going to get this thing to flatline and at one point have any chance to play,” Brocato said. Junior veteran Kyle Ketterman only hopes to get that chance to start another game — he was scheduled to be the team’s top faceoff specialist. Towson softball coach seeks county championship repeat in second season The first season coaching varsity softball for Towson coach Jon Salvino included a Baltimore County championship, trip to the regional finals and 16-3 overall record. Jessie Leatherwood and Emma Kelly were two seniors on the team that won the school’s first county title in softball since 1993. Leatherwood pitched a 4-hit shutout in the win over Catonsville and Kelly drove in two runs and had this to say after the game. “Me and Jessie have been playing together since middle school, so we’ve had a long time coming together and its so cool to watch, especially with both of us being seniors this year, it was really awesome and she had such a good game and she’s had such a good season this year, so it’s really fun to watch,” said Kelly, who got her clutch two-run single in the bottom of the third inning with two outs.” Bonds are formed in every spring sport and getting to share that final prep season together is an emotional honor for all seniors and their families. This year’s Towson softball team has only two seniors and head coach Jon Salvino would love to see them play in more than the three scrimmages they played consecutively, before schools were closed for two weeks. “Will we get to play this season?,” he asked. “It breaks my heart if we don’t because I know how much it means to the team, but also those seniors who have just done so much for the program in their four years.” The seniors are Taylor Brumagin and Sydney Martin. “The one senior, Taylor Brumagin has been on top of everything from the get-go, she has just been awesome, same with Sydney Martin,” Salvino said. “Anything I’ve asked them to do they just hop right to it.” Martin is slated to be the team’s number one hurler, and she has company behind her. “She leads a very unique pitching staff,” Salvino said. “I don’t think you will see too many softball teams that use four pitchers.” Junior Olivia Ingrao, who is also a standout first baseman, sophomore Lexi Predmore and freshman Julianna Leatherwood, Jessie’s sister, also made the staff. “Sydney is definitely the most experienced, she has come into this season and she has just looked sharp in her command in the scrimmages that we played,” Salvino said. “She is not someone who is going to overpower people, but she moves the balls and she hits her spots and keeps the ball in play.” With a roster of only 11, that also includes juniors Julia Kallaur, Nicole Poling, Allie Arguello and Macie Hakim and freshman Eve Bartkowiak and Lexi Bradford, Salvino knows his players need to be versatile. “This group is just young and enthusiastic and hungry to learn and they were really putting in the work and I think that was a trait that was going to carry us this year,” Salvino said. “Everyone understood that we are all in and everyone is going to be expected to play multiple positions and everyone is going to have a big role to play.” Wins in all three scrimmages, against Francis Scott Key, Winters Mill and Manchester Valley, gave the coach confidence. “If this season ever gets underway and we get a chance to play, it’s going to be a big learning curve, but I think the team is just going to get better as the weeks and days go on,” Salvino said. The coach admitted spring is his favorite season but this one, which begins March 19th, is empty. “Every day that goes by I’m thinking about the seniors and hoping they get a chance to play this year, because I would be devastated for those seniors if they don’t get to play out their senior year,” said Salvino, who hopes they could still play even if classes are postponed until May 1. “If we are going back to school, why not just be able to play. Sport is a way for people to escape, it’s a way for them to unite and achieve things together through hardships and rougher times.” Towson girls lacrosse coach wants to see young players grow One day after the Towson girls lacrosse team played a scrimmage on March 11, the team heard the news that schools would be closed for two weeks starting March 16. A day off for icy conditions, or three days off because of a heavy snowstorm, can make a high school student celebrate, but, not the news that was necessitated because of the pandemic coronavirus. “The kids had scrimmaged North Harford the day before and the kids were obviously very upset because they wanted to go to school because they wanted to go to practice,” Towson coach Jamie Giffuni said. “They were not very pleased to hear that they would be out of school.” She felt for the seniors who have played all their lives to celebrate their final prep season together. “Spring is the last hurrah, we have a lot of multi-sport kids to, who spring would have been there last chance to play together, so it is definitely sad for them,” Giffuni said. Rallying around a captain was not an option. “We hadn’t even got that far yet, we hadn’t even got to the voting process, it wasn’t long enough for the kids coming back from basketball to get a good sense of all these upperclassmen leaders, so we weren’t going to vote until that weekend,” Giffuni said. Captain’s practices are not allowed. “We are not allowed to condone captain’s practices, that’s been a standard MPSSA policy,” Giffuni said. “The locker room was emptied out of equipment, so what they do when they are not around me, I have no clue, because I’m not a teacher either. My contact with them was only at practice.” Giffuni had a hunch that schools would be closed. “I work at a hospital, so I pretty much had seen this coming for a while and once the colleges started canceling I knew it was only a matter of time,” Giffuni said. “Hopefully, if they do go back to school, no matter if it’s a week and a half or they extend it another two weeks, they do their best to condense the season for them, so I’m hopeful that they will get to play something and that it is not outright cancelled, but I sort of walked out on Wednesday (scrimmage) and knew that was going to be the only time that they got to play.” There was no tempering the coach’s excitement before the abrupt halt. “We were so excited to see how it was going to shake out,” Guffuni said. “We have been watching Anna Corona develop over the last four years and I think she was poised for a great senior year.” Corona plays midfield along junior Natalie Sann. “Natalie Sann, coming back from a concussion last year, she is healthy, we were so excited to get a full season with her,” said the coach. The future also looks bright. “We had some really, really talented freshmen that we were really excited to see how they would acclimate to playing with the older and bigger kids,” Giffuni said. “We lost a lot, but we retained a good core, so we were all excited to see how they were all going to mesh together.” In addition to Corona, the other Towson seniors are attackers Sofie Sorteberg and Sofia Grose and defenders Julia Buttarazzi and Caelinn Saterfield. “We have a good junior class, but I feel gutted for the senior class, most of them have been on the team for the last four years, so I wanted them to get that fourth year together,” Giffuni said.

MIT report shows how Maryland and other states have fared in remote education guidance during coronavirus pandemic
.W
As schools have turned to distance learning amid school closures forced by the coronavirus pandemic, one report has looked into how state education agencies across the nation have fared in their guidance to school systems, students and families. According to a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Systems Lab, Maryland has satisfied seven of the 21 criteria established for guidance. The criteria include measures such as providing statements on amendments to grading policies, graduation requirements and provisions to special education services. The report is not a ranking of states, but rather a snapshot view of state education policy, said the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Systems Lab, which noted that state education agencies may be communicating with local agencies outside website communications. The report was initially released April 1 and includes a link to the dataset for the criteria, has been updated multiple times since it was first published. The report reviewed state education agency guidance in all 50 states to determine areas of consensus. Recommendations are also provided on best practices for state education agencies during school closures. Maryland officials have extended the closure of public schools to May 15.

Letter: Celebrating Earth Day in Howard County is even more important during the coronavirus pandemic
.W
Celebrating Earth Day is important even now The 50th Earth Day comes during a pandemic. Howard County’s GreenFest was canceled, along with many other observances. Virtual celebrations are good but no substitute. Is this Earth Day a bust? For me, it’s more important than ever. In the time of COVID-19 and staying home, nature is precious. I delight in touring our yard to spot new growth: the first teeny flowers on our paw paw; the once stick of a dogwood now a flowering teenage tree; the sedges, rushes and winterberries in our new rain garden revived after their first winter. The colors of spring uplift. I’m grateful for the Howard County and Columbia paths that bring the woods to my home. A grove of jack-in-the-pulpits has popped up beside the Red Bandana path in Dorsey Hall where I live. On the Gwynn Acres path bordering the Little Patuxent River, the squat, aged, battered tulip poplar with record-setting girth is sprouting new leaves. But the invasive lesser celandine carpeting the woods with bright points of yellow flowers thrives as well. It’s strangled our early spring friends, the delicate white bloodroot and yellow trout lily. Spring beauties and violets struggle, too. A tiny invisible virus has upended our lives in just a few months. What if the gradual but accelerating change in our climate upends our lives, too, by upsetting the very natural world that has been our solace through this pandemic? Earth Day reminds us of our responsibility to be stewards of nature. I want nature to remain as rich for those that follow as it has been for me. That’s why in the midst of this horrific pandemic, I worry about climate change and why Earth Day is more relevant than ever.

Maryland school leaders and health experts say coronavirus shutdown could last months
.W
School leaders and health experts say a long term shutdown of schools — perhaps through the end of the school year — seems increasingly likely with new federal guidance showing a short closure has little impact on slowing the spread of coronavirus. Maryland State School Superintendent Karen Salmon said Monday she was looking at extending the closure of schools beyond the two weeks already announced. Salmon spoke with the state’s 24 district superintendents Monday afternoon about next steps. “We are actively looking a the modeling that shows where this virus is going and so we will be making some decisions about that," Salmon said at a press conference, where Gov. Larry Hogan also banned gatherings of 50 or more people and closed bars, restaurants, gyms and theaters. "The reason I closed schools for two weeks is to assess the situation.” Her comments follow new CDC guidance, released Friday, that indicates schools could be closed between eight and 20 weeks in order to help slow “substantial community spread” of the disease. Most Baltimore-area school districts are scheduled to wrap up for summer in mid-June, within that window. However there are potential downsides, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the likelihood that children will continue to find places to congregate. “It almost seems prudent that schools be shut down for the rest of the year,” said Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators. Domenech said he will propose schools remain closed for a long period, and is talking with other national education leaders about whether to ask President Donald Trump to recommend schools be closed. Superintendents across the nation are expected to receive a briefing by the CDC on Tuesday. One question that remains is how long schools should close and will it be announced immediately. “If you shut down the school for four weeks, have you really had an impact on the spread?" asked Domenech, adding that superintendents would like better clarity on such issues from the CDC, he said. “I think it is very unlikely that schools will reopen” in two weeks, said Tara Kirk Sell, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Not all countries hit hard by the virus have closed schools. Singapore kept its schools open but adopted very aggressive health measures to clean schools and prevent the spread. And South Korea was able to use sophisticated methods to track down people who had been exposed, quarantine and test them. “They have had greater testing capacity to do these things that it seems like we are still moving toward,” Sell said. In the United States, whether schools are closed for many months depends on how effectively the social distancing measures that have been put in place work. A long term closure of schools is not something public health experts take lightly and is recognized to have “incredible economic consequences,” she said. "This is a policy decision that people are still grappling with. It remains to be seen if all the measures work in the context of our country,” she said. About half of all school children in the nation — about 35.9 million — are now at home, according to Education Week which has been tracking school closures. As of noon Monday, 35 states have decided to close public schools. Combined with district closures in other states, at least 69,000 schools are closed. There are 98,277 U.S. public schools and almost 50.8 million public school students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Both national teachers unions are calling for schools across the nation to close. In addition, the CDC said, in 40 percent of families, grandparents, an age group most most likely to contract a severe case of the disease, will be taking care of children home from school. “Closing schools for the rest of the year should be on the table," said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association. “The most important thing right now is to follow the guidance of public health officials to limit and ultimately stop the spread of this virus” But Bost said school systems have to make sure children receive meals and that hourly employees are paid. Everyone must “work together to address the trauma, anxiety and confusion that many of our students may experience in the coming weeks.” Baltimore County Superintendent Darryl Williams said he can’t predict whether schools will be closed for a long time, but he is operating as though they will. “This two week window will give us time to think about the what-ifs. I think we should probably be prepared if we get to that point,” he said, listing the many adjustments that will need to be made. Besides adapting the curriculum to an online format, the county will need to provide paper materials for students to use who don’t have access to the internet. And there must be a way to grade the work. Special needs students, immigrants and others will need to receive accommodations in a different way. And there’s graduations, proms, testing and athletics to be considered, he said. Katherine Mullen, a Dundalk High School history teacher, said closing schools for the rest of the year may be wise for public health but “the long term impact academically is just enormous." The gaps in learning will be particularly difficult for students who are already behind and for students who are learning English and trying to master subjects. Baltimore County is one of the state’s school systems with nearly one laptop for every student. So many of its classes could go online if families have internet access at home. Mullen believes, however, it would be difficult for any student to remain motivated if they are at home and signed on to a computer. Mullen said schools must be prepared to really recreate the curriculum for next year to build in review for students. Parents are beginning to take the situation more seriously since Hogan began putting in place stringent measures to contain the spread, said Joe Kane, the treasurer of the Baltimore’s Parent and Community Advisory Board. Many parents expect the school closing to be extended beyond two weeks, but if schools remain shut for months parents will need a lot of guidance from school officials. “Across the city, we are a district with high concentrations of poverty," Kane said. "How does this play out long term?” For some students, Kane said, the schools aren’t just centers for learning and eating, they also serve as the place for students to get eye exams, glasses and dental care. Parents will want to know if summer school will be available and what happens to their child’s education when it is stopped in the middle of the year, he said. “A lot has happened over the weekend,” Kane said. “I think parents read about what is happening across the world, and they understand this is just the beginning.”

Orioles players waiting in Sarasota as MLB bars teams from holding large workouts amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
With new guidance coming from Major League Baseball on Sunday as to how teams and players should proceed through the league-wide cancellation of spring training games and two-week delay of the start of the regular season due to the coronavirus pandemic, Orioles players are trying to figure out the best and safest way to prepare for the season while honoring the nationwide calls to avoid large gatherings to prevent the virus’ spread. “Our general concern right now is the wellbeing of everyone,” reliever Richard Bleier said in a text message. “This is bigger than baseball, with a lot of people already affected. We are going to stay ready with the hopes of this passing and getting back to the game we love. Until then, we are trying to stay safe and hoping everyone else does too.” Guidance from the league changed Friday, the first day after the league’s decision to push back the start of the season. At first, players were instructed to stay put, as teams, including the Orioles, thought it best to limit unnecessary travel and keep players around the team’s medical staffs. But hours later, they were given permission to go home, an indication that it might be longer than a two-week delay in the regular season starting. While some teams, including the Minnesota Twins and Pittsburgh Pirates, all ordered their players home, the Orioles’ major leaguers have largely remained in the Sarasota, Florida, area waiting to find out what they can and can’t do. A memorandum from the league reported by multiple outlets, including The Athletic, said that talks were continuing with the Major League Baseball Players Association on how they can agree to proceed, and clubs would be informed at noon Monday of the protocols, but “the strong recommendation from our infectious disease and public health experts is that clubs should avoid all activities in which players congregate in significant numbers or are otherwise unable to practice the ‘social distancing’ protocols recommended by the CDC.” The memo says that all nonroster players should return home, as happened with the Orioles’ minor leaguers Saturday, with spring training complexes open to players on the 40-man major league roster. Those facilities, at least for the time being, must be open to major league players who want to use it, with limited staff and no requirement for normal services like meals. “Until we develop appropriate protocols to minimize the risks to players (which we are actively working on), clubs are not permitted to hold or organize any group workouts, practices, skill or conditioning sessions, or other player activities at their facilities," the memo reads. "To the extent activities are permitted in the future, those activities must be conducted pursuant to protocols that we will issue that are designed to slow the transmission of the virus — for example, limiting the number of coaches and club staff who may work with players at any one time, staggering the time period that players are in the same area of the facility, and implementing hygiene and social distancing practices.” As that wait continues, Orioles players are getting their work in however they can. A group of pitchers including John Means, Shawn Armstrong and Tanner Scott posted on social media that they were throwing off a mound at Sarasota High School on Saturday. In less formal workouts, outfielder Austin Hays posted video on Instagram of backyard catch with pitcher Chandler Shepherd and minor league infielder Rylan Bannon, complete with Hays jumping into the canal near their house to retrieve a baseball and practicing robbing home runs over the fence separating their yard from the neighbors. Outfielder Dwight Smith Jr. posted that he was in what appeared to be a hotel gym. Balancing staying safe and getting ready for the season, as Bleier said, could take on many different forms. While MLB said last week that the earliest the season could start would be April 9, the league seems to be bracing for a longer delay than that. On the minor league side, players were sent home Saturday after a brief moment of confusion. Minor league players get a per diem, albeit smaller than major leaguers, as well as a housing allowance during spring training. They don’t get paid for spring training, however, and their already-low salaries only kick in when the season begins.

Howard County crafter sews face masks for health care workers amid coronavirus outbreak
.W
As the COVID-19 pandemic changes our lives, we are all enjoying the feel-good stories about people stepping up to help each other. One from our neighborhood involves Beverly Perry. When she heard about shortages of personal protective equipment, Perry decided she wanted to sew face masks for health care workers. When Gov. Larry Hogan announced that all caregivers in nursing homes should wear face masks, Perry contacted Angel’s Touch Assisted Living to ask if the caregivers there needed some masks. Her timing was perfect. She created well-made and color-coordinated masks. They were works of art, not just protective equipment. Perry said she has a passion for fashion and loves to sew. She started sewing clothing when she was a child, and for the past five or six years, she has created beautiful women’s fabric tote bags and purses. She sells them at craft shows and is scheduled to appear at Christmas in July at the Howard County Fairgrounds and Summer Fest at the Howard County Living Farm Heritage Museum, if the quarantine ends by then. Many craft shows are being canceled, but when our world returns to normal, Beverly’s Beautiful Bags & More will be appearing again. Watch for it. Amy Syversen, the director of bands for Dayton Oaks Elementary School, shared some information about what her students are doing to keep up with their music while schools are closed. Syversen is playing music on her porch almost every night at 6 p.m. She records herself playing and posts the performance to the school’s Twitter page. She also has been taking advantage of the free online music lessons available from the Howard County Public Library. Syversen also is learning to play harmonica. Her students are joining in as well. Andrew Sheng has recorded himself practicing music and shared the performance with Syversen. Christopher Endlich played saxophone while his older brother Charlie played trombone in a duet, which they recorded for her. Colton Fansler, a percussionist, has been doing FaceTime drum lessons with his drum teacher. He was quick to tell Syversen that he misses band. Percussionist Joe Morris has also been practicing drums. Fourth-grade saxophonist Max Dapko has played on his porch for his neighbors, who seemed to enjoy it. Tyler Bowman is playing piano at home. At school, he is learning to play flute, and he is practicing both instruments. He also took the time to recommend some beginning piano music books to Syverson, who is teaching piano to her children while they are home. Many other students have participated in the school’s virtual music day by sharing videos and pictures with their classmates. Music is important for everyone now because it makes us happy. Syversen has named the band musicians of the month for Dayton Oaks for the month of April: Harley Rosen, Will Short, Aylin Hunter, William Fortune, Clark Conn, Casey Moss, Ava Stephenson, Aryan Patel, Aaryan Patel, Tyler Bowman, Ryan Matos, Max Dapko, Mohammad Izzeddin, Andrew Sheng, Sankarsh Velaga, Alex Galgano, Ellie Frank, Brenden Lukenich, Caden Starcher, Alexander El Sawi and Leon Du have all been impressing Syversen with their eagerness to learn and play music. Kassidy Sharp, the theater arts director at Glenelg High School, and the members of the cast of the musical “Hairspray” were devastated by the school closings. The performance should have been at the end of March but had to be canceled when schools closed two weeks before. Sharp still hopes that they will be able to present the show sometime during the next year, when the senior cast members are home from college. She is staying in touch with the cast members, who are all eager to present this musical that they spent so much time preparing. In addition to the time and energy expended, the theater department has invested over $10,000, which would be a huge loss for the school. Teachers and students are learning together as everyone adjusts to distance learning. Everyone is realizing how much they really liked going to school, being part of the community that each classroom becomes on a daily basis. At Folly Quarter Middle School, students and staff have adopted some families in the community who are in need of food. During the school year, Folly Quarter was working with Homewood Center on several community projects. Now that schools are closed, they are working together to collect and distribute by way of contactless food delivery to families facing significant hardships. Even when students and teachers aren’t seeing each other every day, they still manage to work together to help others. The seniors at Glenelg have missed out on many of the highlights of senior year, including the spring musical, spring sports, concerts, prom and senior class night, as well as graduation. While some of these events will be held virtually, it won’t be the same. However, the students and staff are working together to create new experiences to remember. For many years, the students at Glenelg have collected food for Pi Day on March 14. Pi, of course, is the number which represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter and begins with 3.141. Schools closed on March 13, but the students still managed to collect 2,000 pounds of food. In addition, an anonymous donor gave $1,000 to the Maryland Food Bank in Glenelg’s name once the students collected 3,141 items. Have you started working on your garden yet? Normally at this time of year, there would be Ask a Master Gardener Plant Clinics at the Glenwood Branch of the Howard County Public Library. The clinics cannot be held because the library is closed, but you can still have your questions answered by going to extension.umd.edu. You can ask a question anytime on this site or you can send an email to HoCoAAMG@gmail.com. If you have insects or plants you want to have identified, just send a picture along with your request.

Before coronavirus gets to campus, Maryland colleges restrict access to slow disease’s spread
.W
In a cascade of announcements Tuesday evening and into Wednesday, Maryland colleges and universities said they would be sending students home and turning to online learning for at least two weeks in the face of a coronavirus pandemic. There’s been no confirmed cases on a college campus in the state. Young people who get COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, aren’t usually horribly sick. So why is nearly every public and private institution temporarily canceling face-to-face classes after spring break? Health officials say it is the correct decision, one that is born out of experience during past epidemics and from other countries already dealing with COVID-19, such as Italy. Limiting contact slows the spread of the disease, they said, allowing hospitals to keep pace with those needing care. University closures “are part of a larger set of interventions that could have a big impact overall," said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “We don’t know yet how much university closures can help versus canceling large gatherings versus canceling other events." However, he said that the virus spreads when people come together and so "if we can slow that down for a time, hopefully we can ... give more time for institutions to prepare and have less sick people all at one time.” Health officials are now calling for social distancing, a new term that has entered the public consciousness in the past week. The idea is to stay away from others to prevent spreading the virus. The textbook example comes from the 1918 Spanish flu when two cities — Philadelphia and St. Louis — reacted differently. Philadelphia held a parade attended by 200,000 people. A few days later, the hospitals were overwhelmed with patients. By the end of the week, 4,500 people had died. When St. Louis experienced its first cases, leaders locked down the city forbidding meetings of more than 20 people. The death rate there was half of Philadelphia’s. A chart of the illnesses shows a very steep spike of cases in Philadelphia and a flat low curve of cases that extended over a longer period in St. Louis. A 2007 study of the 1918 flu indicates that multiple measures can be used to slow the virus to produce that low, flattened curve. The key, researchers found, was to start early before the disease was widespread. How long university access will be restricted is unclear. But Joann Boughman, senior vice chancellor for academic and student affairs at the 177,000-student University System of Maryland, said leadership including the college presidents and chancellor are listening to health care providers who are concerned the country could quickly run out of intensive care beds. Some students at Towson University and UMBC began packing up their dorm rooms Tuesday and Wednesday at the direction of their schools, with the unanswered question of whether they will be back at all this semester. A long term closure brings a host of issues to college campuses. What happens to hourly workers who won’t be able to do their jobs? How do students taking laboratory sciences finish their course work? How will professors ensure the security of online exams? UMBC information systems freshman Joshua Sanchez, a Calvert County resident, said he and his peers are wondering if the school is going to do anything to reimburse students who pay for housing and dining meals on campus. His sister UMBC senior Rachael Sanchez, has three jobs on campus, and she’s worried the closures will affect her ability to make money. “Many people have on campus jobs and if we’re not able to do those jobs we might have an issue paying bills and personal expenses,” she said. “I think overall, we’re not trying to panic." “There’s a little bit of confusion as people try to figure out their living situations and the nitty-gritty of paying their bills.” Some of Joshua Sanchez’s professors, he said, are worried the school will extend the period for which campus is closed as more cases come up over spring break. “Two weeks could turn into a month,” Sanchez said. He’s nonetheless hopeful he and his peers will be fine, adding that he’s read the elderly and those who are already ill are more susceptible to the virus than people in his generation. “Spring break is a moment of truth. Do you let students go and come back when the chances are much higher someone is infected?" said Joshua Sharfstein, Vice Dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And universities are in some ways responsible to kids when they are here. It creates a sense of not wanting to make decisions that put students in harm’s way.” "There are so many challenges here and so many unknowns. Italy was a real wake up call. They have a great health care system but there’s not enough room for patients. We have to be honest that’s a scenario we could see here if weren’t not able to prevent it,” said Sharfstein. Despite all of the health consequences, officials say they are aware that there are other consequences for students if they cannot get access to the course work, or don’t finish a semester and yet carry the financial aid debt from it. The decision is highly unusual. Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, said he cannot remember a time in the past 50 years — with the exception of Hurricane Katrina when universities were forced to shut their doors. “We are in a pandemic and institutions are making complicated decisions very quickly,” Hartle said. “I believe institutions are erring on the side of caution.” There’s even questions about whether to hold commencements, USM’s Boughman said. She said the presidents are aware that for some students getting to graduation is a “life changing event” that would be difficult to miss. University system presidents discussed it on a Wednesday conference call and Boughman expects a decision to be made in about two weeks to give parents enough time to decide on their travel plans. The pandemic may not be as severe in the United States as it is in other countries, said Johns Hopkins’ Inglesby, but it is unclear how many cases we have because testing has not been extensive. Nevertheless, he said, measures can work to help the situation. “We see in other countries these interventions have been done after hundreds of deaths. If they had been done earlier they would have made a difference sooner.” Baltimore Sun reporter Wilborn Nobles contributed to this story.

Orioles, other MLB teams to donate $1 million each in support of ballpark employees during coronavirus delay
.W
The Orioles and the 29 other Major League Baseball teams will contribute $1 million each in support of ballpark employees who will be unable to work during the delayed start of the league’s season because of the coronavirus pandemic. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the $30 million contribution from the league Tuesday, a day after MLB announced its season won’t begin until at least mid-May in following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to restrict crowds of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. “Over the past 48 hours, I have been approached by representatives of all 30 clubs to help assist the thousands of ballpark employees affected by the delay in the start of the Major League Baseball season," Manfred said in a statement. "Motivated by desire to help some of the most valuable members of the baseball community, each Club has committed $1 million. The individual clubs will be announcing more details surrounding this support effort in their local communities. The timing of these announcements will vary because of the need to coordinate with state and local laws as well as collective bargaining obligations in an effort to maximize the benefits realized by each group of employees. I am proud that our clubs came together so quickly and uniformly to support these individuals who provide so much to the game we love.” MLB and the MLB Players Association also announced a combined $1 million commitment — split evenly between Feeding America and Meals on Wheels America — to assist those who have difficulty accessing food. The Orioles have yet to formally announce their contribution. The club compensated ballpark workers for lost wages from the 2015 protests in Baltimore, which led to three games scheduled to be at Camden Yards instead played at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, and another notably played without fans inside the stadium. In 2015, Delaware North, which operates food, beverage and retail services at Camden Yards, said it compensated “nearly 1,000 gameday associates" for those four games. The Orioles were set to begin the 2020 campaign March 26 at home against the New York Yankees as part of a three-game series before hosting the Boston Red Sox for three games. The club had 80 scheduled games at Camden Yards, rather than the standard 81, because they are scheduled to host the Red Sox in the Little League Classic in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in August. The Orioles also announced Tuesday that they will close their offices through March 29 and stressed the importance of practicing social distancing and following the advice of medical experts. “This is bigger than baseball, and until we can return to the field, we can all do our part to help ‘flatten the curve’ and and slow the spread of the virus to allow our nation’s healthcare system to serve our most vulnerable neighbors."

How top MIAA QBs Austin Tutas, Jordan Moore and Billy Atkins are preparing during the coronavirus pandemic
.W
As the number of confirmed cases of coronavrius continues to rise in Maryland and abroad, three of the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association A Conference’s top junior quarterbacks have continued to train in a safe manner. Some of them also have seen their recruiting processes change during the outbreak. Archbishop Spalding’s Austin Tutas, Loyola Blakefield’s Jordan Moore and Mount Saint Joseph’s Billy Atkins have continued to grind for the 2020 varsity football season. But quarterbacks have an odd dilemma on their hands. They are the primary ball carriers on the football field, but how can they find someone to throw to when everyone is asked to not gather in groups of five or more? Austin Tutas, Archbishop Spalding Tutas is listed as a three-star, dual-threat quarterback, and is the 38th-ranked player at his position in the country and 36th overall in the state, per 247Sports. The junior rose to stardom in 2019, passing for 2150 yards, 18 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while rushing for 137 yards and two touchdowns. Drawing offers from 15 schools — including Columbia, Harvard, Liberty, UMass, Penn, Temple, Virginia Tech and Yale — Tutas is deep into his recruiting process. The NCAA has placed a ban on visiting colleges until May 31 and the virus has made colleges cancel spring football. As a result, Tutas thinks college coaches have been more laser-focused on the recruiting trail. “I think that coaches have started to focus more on recruiting now just because they don’t have as much of that focus or getting their guys ready,” Tutas said. "I’m sure they’re still doing those Zoom calls — making sure their programs are in order and moving forward, but I think that they’ve put more of an emphasis on reaching out to recruits and players and using this time as best as they can. “It’s been kind of ironic. It’s picked up a lot for me over this break that we’ve had. I’ve been in contact more with coaches now than I was before we were put into quarantine.” He works out daily in his garage, using his home weights and goes on a daily run. The biggest key is finding ways to keep his arm in shape by adhering to the social distancing policies put in place and searching for an open park. “It’s been a little different with everything being closed and there’s not a lot of field access, but as a football player and a quarterback especially, it’s important to try to continue working as hard as you can,” said Tutas. “You can’t just wait around for the season to come back. The show has to go on." The rising senior quarterback has a training partner who also attends Spalding with him. Ashley Tutas, Austin’s sister, has kept up with her soccer training, while Austin works on his football drills. “We’ll go on runs together and a lot of times, my dad will set some stuff up for us and we’ll lift together in the garage,” said Tutas of training with his sister. "It’s definitely been cool to work with her and keep grinding and getting better with her. She’s highly competitive and definitely a better athlete than me. “So, she pushes me and we get better together, but I’m definitely fortunate to have the weight set and the stuff in the garage because I know there’s a lot of athletes that don’t have a lot of access to all of that stuff. I’m just trying to make the most of it.” Jordan Moore, Loyola Blakefield Moore is a three-star Duke commit, the 81st-ranked athlete in the country and the 31st-ranked player in the state, per 247Sports. He’s coming off of a season in which he threw for 2,184 yards, 27 touchdowns and five interceptions while rushing for 649 yards and seven touchdowns. The Loyola signal-caller just committed to Duke on Saturday night, but the coronavirus didn’t speed up his decision. What it did do is buy him and his family more time to figure out which school was the best fit on the field and his academic endeavors. His father, Percy, went through Jordan’s list of offers with him and made their final decision. “We’re fortunate and Jordan was fortunate in the fact that he had 21 schools in front of him and all of them were great institutions to choose from,” Percy Moore said. "As a junior, he was more fortunate than most and we did plan to drive to a couple of schools this spring. “Obviously, with the coronavirus, that was not possible. So, it gave us a chance to sit down as a family, look at the criteria, look at all of the schools in front of him, look at which positions the school were offering to him and to narrow it down.” As for the season at hand, Jordan has continued his preparation through workouts with his brother Jayden, who is also a quarterback. He hasn’t missed a beat with a reliable training partner. “I would say that the coronavirus hasn’t really affected anything at all really,” Jordan Moore said. “I have a full weight set in my basement – I’ve been lifting. My brother, who is also coming into high school next year is a quarterback. So, we’ve been throwing – I’ve been throwing with my brother and my dad. I don’t really think that coronavirus has affected anything with my physical training at all.” Billy Atkins, Mount Saint Joseph Atkins is ranked as the 89th pro-style quarterback in the country and 49th player in the state, per 247Sports. After a monster junior campaign, in which he led the state with 3,089 passing yards, and added 36 touchdowns, seven interceptions, a passer rating of 121.6 and 120 rushing yards. He also led the team to a 9-2 record and an MIAA A Conference championship in 2019. As the leader of his offense, it’s tough to not be able to practice with his team. He has made ways to continue to get better — practicing with his father and still learning about the various defenses that he will face. He has a specific schedule that he adheres to daily. “Basically, I wake up around 9 in the morning, eat breakfast, we leave the house and go to the field for about two hours,” Atkins said. “I throw, I kick, I punt — some running stuff. Then, I’ll eat lunch and I do weight training after that and then I do a quick study and then my homework.” The Gaels quarterback has gotten offers from Buffalo, Morgan State, Virginia Military Institute and William & Mary and has received interest from Holy Cross and James Madison. He’s looking to build his case for more FBS offers, even with the gaudy numbers that he put up last year and the coronavirus lockdown is making it tougher. “It’s been weird because I had about four visits planned for spring break and all of them got canceled,” Atkins said. "I feel like if I would’ve boosted my recruiting a little more than it is right now — I’m not saying that I’m not thankful for what I’ve received because I definitely am — it probably would’ve opened up a little more. “Also, if we would have spring practices, it would’ve helped not just me, but our entire team get to college for free. It definitely slowed it down a lot. Playing quarterback especially, coaches want to see you throw the ball in person. It could be that kind of thing holding them back from them offering me a scholarship. If I was able to visit campus, it would’ve made it a lot easier to get my recruiting up there. It is what it is.” Four of the receivers he will team with in the fall are rising seniors. Dont’e Thornton is a heavily recruited wide receiver prospect. Ausar Crawley has Arizona State knocking at his door with an offer. Tyler Wilkins got an offer from William & Mary. Slot man Semaj Henson has garnered interest from Lafayette after putting together a season in which he had 35 receptions for 536 yards and six touchdowns. “I feel like if they would’ve been able to be seen in-person, it would definitely help out a lot because a coach can see their speed firsthand,” Atkins said of his quartet of receivers. "Sometimes film will make you look a little slower and definitely as a quarterback, it makes your ball velocity look at little slower. Coaches want to see you throw in-person to see the ball velocity. If it was up to me, I would try to practice, but people have got to stay safe. “Guys would’ve definitely exploded recruiting-wise. AC [Crawley], he got Arizona State, Tyler got William & Mary and stuff like that. If they’ve seen them in-person, it could’ve blown up. Guys like Semaj, he could’ve exploded in this Spring training time, but it’s tough — it’s definitely tough.”

Lawmakers urge Gov. Hogan to close Maryland’s gun shops during coronavirus emergency that’s shut down other stores
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is getting pressure to close down the state’s gun stores, which have been allowed to remain open during the coronavirus pandemic when most other retailers have had to shut their doors. Under a series of executive orders — including a stay-at-home order issued Monday — Hogan has gradually closed schools, sit-down restaurants, malls, theaters, gyms, casinos and businesses deemed “nonessential” in hopes of slowing the spread of the virus. Gun shops and shooting ranges, however, made the cut as an “essential” business. “The ability of gun stores to remain open during this pandemic is worrisome for many Marylanders ... It is alarming to see Marylanders stockpiling weapons in such a state of emergency,” dozens of Democratic state lawmakers wrote Thursday in a letter to the Republican governor. Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, a Howard County Democrat who is vice chairwoman of the House of Delegates Judiciary Committee, spearheaded the letter. It was signed by 58 delegates and senators, all Democrats. According to the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action, gun shops remain open in most states. They’re closed in Massachusetts, New Mexico and New York. The institute lists the situation in the states of California, Michigan, Vermont and Washington as “inconsistent” or “developing.” Lawsuits over gun store closure orders are pending in multiple states. Governors are consulting a list of essential businesses circulated by the federal government in developing emergency orders. The most recent guidance from the federal government, issued Saturday, includes on the essential list: “Workers supporting the operation of firearm or ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors, and shooting ranges.” Hogan’s orders cite the federal list, which is produced by the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. His chief spokesman indicated the governor is sticking with the federal guidelines. “Federal guidelines expressly designate gun stores as essential, and the governor’s orders adhere to the federal guidelines," Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci said in a statement. “We appreciate these legislators providing their input as we work together right now to slow the spread of this virus.” If Hogan won’t order gun stores to close, the legislators suggested he restrict their operations to appointments with customers only during limited hours. Some firearm retailers have reported an uptick in sales with the pandemic. And licensed dealers in Maryland conducted more than 29,000 federal background checks for buyers in March — almost twice as many as in February, another indicator of strong sales. An NRA spokeswoman confirmed that the group has advocated to keep stores open, but declined to discuss its strategies. Firearms cannot be sold and delivered through the mail or delivery services. “Our constitution protects our right to possess firearms for self-defense,” NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter said in a statement. “A government cannot simultaneously guarantee the right to possess firearms and then eliminate the only means people have to acquire them.” Hunter said that Americans “need and want the means to protect themselves and their families during these unprecedented times.” Gun control and gun safety groups have raised concerns that in these times, with families largely inside their homes together, there could be an increase in suicides, gun violence and gun accidents. “As Americans are asked to stay home, many might be in closer proximity to guns for longer periods of time. This is a concern because even under normal circumstances, guns in the home are dangerous,” said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the national Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. The legal arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group co-funded by former Democrat presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, argues in a memo that gun shops are not being singled out for closure. Due to public health concerns, other places where people practice their constitutional rights — such as houses of worship, bookstores and performing arts centers — also are closed, Everytown points out. “They are, instead, examples of the sorts of generally applicable rules that courts have held do not violate a constitutional right, despite placing burdens on that right,” the memo argues.

Some Harford day care centers say they’ll remain open amid two-week school closures due to coronavirus
.W
Though Maryland schools will close for two weeks attempting to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, several Harford County day care centers are electing to remain open. Further still, owner and director of Forrest Hill Nature Preschool Lavonne Taylor said day cares and preschools are stepping up to fill vacancies with first responders’ children so they can do their jobs. The Harford County Directors Association met Friday to talk over what child care programs would be closing, Taylor said. Out of approximately 15 represented at the meeting, two said they would close. She explained that the state said child care facilities were safer than schools because they host smaller groups. “There was some guidance from Maryland State Department of Education that suggested as long as child care [centers] are following… the programs already put in place it should be safe for them,” Taylor said. Those programs include disinfecting preschools and day cares, which they already do frequently, she said. Taylor said she is trying to get accurate figures of what child care centers are closing so she can transfer displaced children of emergency service, health care and other important workers to those that are open. "If we close, then that whole group has to find another place for their children,” she said. The measure is only a stopgap until a more permanent solution is found, she said. The director and part co-owner of Stonewall Daycare Center in Fallston, Nicole Haught, said the center has not received a directive from a government agency to close, so the decision was left to their discretion. The center is running normally with an eye toward hygiene — making sure railings, doorknobs, keypads and frequently touched objects receive a thorough cleaning. The children, too, are being carefully monitored. Their health, Haught said, is the deciding factor in keeping the center open. The center follows the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s handwashing guidelines — singing the happy birthday song twice through while washing hands. “This is a unique situation. I do not think in the 40 years we have been open we have had anything like this,” Haught said Friday. She explained that many of the children’s parents work important jobs and need to be there through what the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic. She sees the center staying open as paying it forward to them and the kids who may be comforted by the center’s routine. “I am very concerned about this virus, as everybody else is, but I am trying to do my part in the community,” she said. “We have a lot of parents who are first responders, and a lot of children whose parents need to be at work.” In an emailed statement, the Learning Care Group — the Michigan-based company that runs Childtime of Bel Air — said it would remain open and monitor the situation, understanding the burden school closures can be. The company aims to maintain its day cares’ regular schedules “as long as it is safe to do so." “The safety and well-being of our children, families and staff is our top priority,” the statement said. “We recognize that school closures strain families and communities — affecting learning, nutrition and other critical services such as healthcare. At this time we will remain open, continue to monitor the situation and cooperate with state and local officials.” The company is following the CDC’s guidance and promoting staff and children to wash their hands frequently. They, too, are disinfecting surfaces and items found in their center. Wellness checks are done throughout the day, and children who show signs of illness are sent home until they do not show symptoms for at least one day, according to the statement. “If a child or teacher at our school was diagnosed with COVID-19, we would close immediately and follow guidance from the state and local health departments,” the statement reads. Though schools are shuttered, Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson said will still make arrangements to feed students in need. It is using its summer meals program as a basis for what it plans to offer during the closure, but will build off that to make sure meals reach more students. As of 5 p.m. Friday, the specifics of where the food services will be provided was not decided. Kensington Kindercare and Kiddie Academy of Abingdon said they were open but referred questions to corporate offices, which did not return requests for comment. A representative from the Maryland Department of Health was unable to answer questions for this article by 5 p.m. Friday.

Edelman: Fauchi, most levels of government providing sound advice for dealing with coronavirus outbreak
.W
Our immune system is a pretty remarkable thing. It consists of several moving parts, white blood cells, the organs that produce them, proteins and tissues. The immune system maintains a memory of the pathogens, mainly bacteria and viruses, that it encountered as we grew up and were exposed to them. It has a triggering system that goes to work when one of those pathogens reenters our body — when they do, the immune system is ready to do battle with them to keep us healthy. The immune system doesn’t come with a directory of cold viruses or harmful bacteria. We have to be exposed to them first, so they can be recognized. This means that when a virus that our immune system doesn’t recognize enters your body, the virus has a head-start in doing what viruses do, which is usually to make us sick. Eventually, if our immune systems are healthy, we get the better of those invaders, we get over the cold or flu or sinus infection, and the next time that virus (or bacterium) is encountered, the immune system knows just what to do. It produces millions of white blood cells that recognize the invading virus and dumps them in the blood stream. They then locate and destroy cells that have been invaded and turned into virus-producing machines. When we get a flu shot, we are trying to give the immune system a head start on the flu by teaching it to recognize the virus in a safe way, usually with dead viruses (which is rather tricky, because viruses are barely alive to begin with). Vaccine producers need to show that the vaccine is effective, i.e., that it immunizes us, and also that it’s safe. That process takes time. Medical researchers cannot produce a vaccine for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, in four months, no matter how motivated they are. That leads us to the next question: “If we can’t immunize ourselves against COVID-19, currently making its merry way across the globe, what can we do to protect ourselves?” And that is a very important question indeed, because this particular bug is pretty dangerous. The CDC has some very smart experts, and you can find their advice for protecting yourself at www.cdc.gov. All levels of government can help, and most of them do. In Maryland, the legislature and Gov. Hogan have worked to coordinate with health organizations; the state is trying to get test kits to identify people infected with the virus, and the state released rainy-day reserve funds to use to prevent the spread of the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauchi, chief immunology expert at NIH, added his recommendations: limit travel and crowds, and “just don’t get on a cruise ship.” He said that the elderly and those with “underlying conditions” are “overwhelmingly” more likely to have complications if they catch the virus. Fauchi also said that the nation may have to reconsider its approach to large crowds and social gatherings if the condition worsens. And we’ve seen signs that people are listening. The world-renowned South by Southwest music conference was cancelled, and Johns Hopkins University is hosting the first two rounds of the NCAA Division III basketball tournament without any spectators allowed. Fauchi stated that there are two fundamental ways to manage the epidemic: containment and mitigation. Containment is largely the process of keeping people from getting exposed to the virus; quarantining infected people would be effective, but for the fact that the country lacks sufficient facilities to isolate the many thousands of people who have been exposed to the virus, even if they could be identified. The World Health Organization points out another problem with quarantining: there aren’t enough medical workers to do it, and there isn’t enough personal protective equipment to keep them safe while treating the sick. For you and me, risk mitigation is taking steps to prevent getting infected: you have probably heard the very common-sense steps we all should take, from frequently washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds and disinfecting high-contact areas, such as kitchen surfaces, in your home. If you’re sick, stay away from work or school. And listen to Fauchi’s advice on crowds. Even the notoriously dirty New York subways are getting frequent scrubdowns now! We depend on the government in times of risk to give us well-founded information and the kind of guidance that Fauchi and other experts in the field provide. Unfortunately, the message from the White House has been confused, misleading, or dangerous. Dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak is a serious public health matter, one that should never be politicized. Some things are just more important than a politician’s reelection strategy or fragile ego. This is one of them. Mitch Edelman writes from Finksburg. Email him at mjemath@gmail.com

‘It is going to be a big burden’: Harford parents react to closure of schools to prevent spread of coronavirus
.W
Cheralyn Crawford, a mother of four, isn’t sure what she’s going to do the next few weeks after Maryland announced public schools would be closed starting Monday to prevent against the spread of the novel coronavirus. Crawford, and a number of other parents interviewed Friday morning around Magnolia Middle School agreed that the school closures were unnecessary. A week off might have been warranted, but two weeks is too long. They were also frustrated there was next to no notice of the closures before they happened, which left Crawford in search of a daycare and a plan for what to do on a limited budget. The mother of four said the schools “sprung it on” her, calling 30 minutes after Gov. Larry Hogan’s Thursday afternoon press conference to inform her of the closure. She and her husband will have to alternate taking off from work. Some of her children also received lunch at school, adding more expenses to an already tight balance. Her youngest — a 2-year-old, bundled up in a car-seat at the rear of the sedan as Crawford dropped off her middle-schooler at Magnolia — could stay with her grandmother, but her other children, 7, 11 and 14, would require some parental supervision. Many others are dealing with the same issue, she said, so she imagined it would be hard to find a friend to keep an eye on the kids. “It is going to be a big burden,” she said. “Everybody is having the same issue; there is nowhere else to turn.” The school told Jamie Tressler that homework would be assigned during the interruption. Her 17- and 14-year-old are old enough to stay home unsupervised, but she is glad they will have schoolwork to do. “They are going to have chores,” she said wryly. “It is not going to be a vacation.” Students will bring home instructional materials to be completed during the systemwide closure, according to a robo-call to parents that went out Thursday. Jumar Jefferson said his son told him about the closing when he came home Thursday. Now he has to call his boss and figure out when he can take time off from his construction job to watch his son. The 12-year-old’s mother also works, Jefferson said, so they will have to coordinate times to take off work. “It is going to be hard,” he said. “We are going to have to switch it up.” After dropping his 9-year-old son off at Bakerfield Elementary School in Aberdeen, Arkeen Davis said he thought fears of the virus were exaggerated. He works at the Boys and Girls Club, which is also closed, but plans to put his time into another part-time job at IHOP. He said he did not worry about the virus, which he thought was not as threatening as advertised, but recognized that fatalities in Harford County could presage trouble. “It will become real serious if somebody dies [in Harford County],” he said. “I will give it a week, then everything will be back to normal.” He was glad to hear homework would be issued for the duration, though saddened that many major and college-league sporting events have been cancelled. “I am just worried about the kids,” he said. Some parents though, like Tom Brochu, said he was anticipating the closures. “Honestly after seeing how things have gone in other countries, it was just a matter of time until schools here were called off. I honestly don’t look for them to go back until mid- to late April,” said Brochu, who has three sons – one at Havre de Grace Middle and two in Havre de Grace Elementary. He said it was disappointing that, nationwide, there aren’t tele-education programs already in place for instances like this. “I mean Hurricane Katrina 15 years ago should have started the planning process for a long term school cancelation event like this,” Brochu said. Bill Berg, who has a daughter at Havre de Grace High School, said he was fine with “whatever it takes to get the spread under control.” “I’m all for proactive approaches. I think that these aren’t knee jerk reactions to the virus spreading,” he said. “I believe that this has been in some sort of emergency plan at the federal government, CDC or World Health Organization level and once it got to a certain point they started recommending a course of action.” Berg and his family didn’t have any plans for spring break — Harford had planned to close Friday, April 10 through Monday, April 13 — but said he could see how it would be an inconvenience for many families that planned trips. “But I look at it as being proactive to prevent against an even larger outbreak,” he said. Callie Yeager, a mom with two sons at Meadowvale Elementary, said she’s fearing how late into the summer students will be attending school to make up for any time missed. “I’m assuming we’re going to be going late [in June] to make up for the two weeks,” she said.

Ocean City mayor urges beachgoers not to visit amid coronavirus pandemic as start of tourism season in flux
.W
At a time of year when Ocean City would normally begin gearing up for visitors, the resort town’s mayor is urging those tourists, “Now is not the time to visit Ocean City.” “To further protect our residents, visitors and Town employees we request that visitors postpone trips to Ocean City beginning immediately” to prevent spread of the new coronavirus, Mayor Rick Meehan said in a statement issued Thursday. In an interview, Meehan said town officials are still waiting to decide whether the annual Springfest, which typically helps kick off weekend tourism as the weather warms, can go on as scheduled May 7-10. “Usually I’m the mayor that’s inviting everyone to come to Ocean City,” he said. “Following the governor’s lead, I think drastic measures do need to be taken. ... We’re treating this very seriously.” Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday ordered residents to avoid group gatherings larger than 10 people, and directed indoor malls to close as the state reported 22 new cases of COVID-19, the infection the coronavirus causes. Those moves follow earlier decisions to close schools, restaurant dining rooms, bars and movie theaters. In Maryland, 107 people have tested positive for the virus, and one person died Wednesday. But there are no confirmed cases in Worcester County, where Ocean City is located, and only a single confirmed case on the Eastern Shore, in Talbot County. A host of Ocean City events have been canceled over the coming weeks, including job fairs during which the town’s hospitality industry would normally staff up for the summer season. Several thousand foreign workers also typically come to Ocean City each season, but given global travel restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus, Meehan said it’s unclear if and when they’ll be able to come this year. “That issue is outstanding,” he said. “I’m not really sure at this point how that will be resolved.”

Maryland residents have lost jobs and income due to coronavirus. Here’s where to get help paying for housing.
.W
With rent and mortgage due at the beginning of April, researchers anticipate more Marylanders will need help paying for their housing as they suffer the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and related business shutdowns. As of Monday, Maryland had at least 1,413 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 17 deaths as a result of the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Public services are restricted and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has closed nonessential businesses. He issued a stay-at-home order Monday. Maryland courts have suspended evictions and foreclosures, meaning landlords cannot start the eviction process. However, residents still will owe rent payments, and researchers tracking calls to help lines across the United States say requests for rent assistance have increased since the pandemic began. Matthew Kreuter, a professor of public health at Washington University in St. Louis, and his team track calls to Maryland’s 211 information and referral help line. Kreuter said they found requests for rent assistance referrals in Maryland were up 151% this year from 2019 as COVID-19 became a pandemic. Maryland had 1,038 requests for rent assistance from March 12 to March 29 this year, compared with 413 requests during that period last year. Most requests are coming from Baltimore City (196) and County (162), followed by Prince George’s (158), Montgomery (104) and Anne Arundel (53), Kreuter said. The researchers from 211 Counts and Washington University in St. Louis expect that requests could increase even further over time. The U.S. Department of Labor reported last week that a record 3.3 million Americans, including 42,000 Marylanders, applied for unemployment benefits. But regulators and organizations say they’re ready to help people pay their mortgage or rent. Here’s a list of resources for homeowners, renters and the owners of small businesses or nonprofits who may be feeling the pinch. Resources for homeowners Homeowners need to contact their mortgage servicer to see if they qualify for a mortgage relief program. See your most recent monthly statement for your mortgage lender or servicer’s website and consumer contact information. If you do not have your statement, use the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System to search for the company by name. Expect long waiting times as servicers are likely dealing with many inquiries at this time. Have your loan statement ready and know how much your income has been reduced and what your weekly unemployment benefits are. The Maryland Bankers Association has an online list of what its member banks are doing to help customers. Likewise, the American Bankers Association released an online list of the banks offering payment deferrals with no late fees for mortgage and home equity loans. If you have an inquiry or complaint about a mortgage lender or servicer, contact the Maryland Department of Labor by email at DLFRComplaints-LABOR@maryland.gov or by phone at 410-230-6077. The Maryland HOPE Initiative (Home Owners Preserving Equity) also has resources to help you keep your home. Call HOPE at 1-877-462-7555. Under the $2 trillion coronavirus response bill signed by President Donald Trump last week, homeowners with federally backed mortgage loans can request payments be postponed for up to 180 days. Homeowners can then request a second 180 postponement, if needed. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to suspend foreclosures and evictions for at least 60 days for some mortgages. Borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac also can suspend payments for 12 months. Similar mortgage relief programs are being offered for those with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration or for VA loans through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Resources for renters Renters should call their landlords to discuss their payment options. The Federal Housing Finance Agency announced Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will offer multifamily property owners mortgage forbearance if they suspend evictions for renters unable to pay rent due to the coronavirus. The $2 trillion coronavirus response bill provides 120 days of eviction relief for people in federally-funded housing. This means landlords may not charge tenants late fees for delayed payments. The new law also provides additional dollars to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to fund housing vouchers and rent assistance, so tenants should speak with their local housing agency to discuss their options. The Fair Housing Action Center of Maryland also created a list of resources for renters seeking financial assistance.

Despite coronavirus shutdown, Baltimore actress Celeste O’Connor breaks out in Prime’s ‘Selah and the Spades’
.W
Promoting a movie is hard enough in the best of times. Doing it in the midst of a pandemic is even more challenging. Still, actress Celeste O’Connor, in one of her first ever promotional runs, recognized the importance of doing so over the phone instead of in-person. “It’s a cool first experience, definitely different than it would be otherwise," she said. “But it’s so important for everyone to do what they can to stay inside and stay safe, so I really understand and respect the way that people have been able to adjust their lives so quickly.” In what promises to be a breakout role, O’Connor portrays high school student Paloma in the independent drama “Selah and the Spades.” Filmmaker Tayarisha Poe’s debut feature follows title character Selah (Lovie Simone, “Greenleaf”) at the elite Pennsylvania boarding school where she and Maxxie (Jharrel Jerome, who won an Emmy for his performance in Ava DuVernay’s “When They See Us”) run a drug ring. Paloma is the new girl, a curious photographer who falls under Selah’s sway. Their relationship drives much of the film’s most engaging scenes, as Paloma starts asking tough questions about Selah’s role in the school’s hidden party scene. The movie premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival and is available on Amazon Prime Video starting April 17. To prepare for the role, O’Connor drew from character backgrounds that Poe developed in short stories about each character. She also referenced her past as a student at Notre Dame Preparatory School, an all-girls Catholic institution in Towson. “Obviously, this story’s a dramatized version of it, but a lot of the social hierarchies and dynamics were really familiar to me,” she said. O’Connor added that her character acts as the eyes for the audience, witnessing these dynamics play out as Selah takes the initially naive Paloma increasingly under her wing. “Throughout this journey and story, she starts out as someone who is vulnerable and kind of being manipulated, but turns into a person that comes out stronger and more confident because of it,” she said. In reality, O’Connor balances acting with studies at another top school: Johns Hopkins University, where she’s a junior majoring in public health and pre-medicine. She hopes to keep this balance going forth. O’Connor initially got into acting through music. She studied singing and violin through the Peabody Institute’s preparatory program. In fact, she only considered acting in her teens, when a casting director approached her at a talent showcase and said she should try it. Since then, she’s also performed in the movie “Wetlands" while balancing her scholastic work. “I was really grateful and lucky that someone kind of noticed this potential in me and said, ‘Here, you should try this,’” she said. “Once I did, it really developed into something that I’m super passionate about now, even though I wasn’t necessarily looking for it before." The film’s predominantly black leading cast, which also includes “Suits” actress Gina Torres and “Grey’s Anatomy” actor Jesse Williams, separates “Selah and the Spades” from other high school-set movies like “Brick” and “Clueless" — both of which Poe told Yahoo! Life inspired the movie. O’Connor said that issues of diverse representation in entertainment matter to her, especially since seeing movies and TV with black characters made her feel less alone while growing up in a mainly white community. “Hopefully, my work will help other young black kids in the same way that the movies and shows that I watched growing up [helped me],” she said. “But on the other side of things, in terms of my work in public health and political beliefs, I think that not only is representation important, but it’s also important for me to use whatever platform I have to actually, materially, impact the lives of the people in my community.”

Community input meeting for apartments, assisted living center at Route 924 and Plumtree postponed due to coronavirus
.W
A community input meeting on plans to build apartment units, a senior living facility and retail shops at Route 924 and Plumtree Road in Bel Air South has been postponed following Gov. Larry Hogan’s announcement Thursday that gatherings of 250 people or more are prohibited due to the global coronavirus pandemic. The meeting was scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday at the Richlin Catering and Event Center in Edgewood, but those who arrived before the start time encountered signs posted at the main entrance indicating the meeting had been postponed, along with events scheduled for Friday and Saturday at Richlin. Engineer Tom Miner, of Frederick Ward Associates in Bel Air, was on hand for the meeting, and he spent some time outside the event center talking with people about the project. Developers plan to build 205 units of multi-family housing, a senior living facility with 86 units and 186,080 square feet of space for entertainment, office and retail uses, according to a description posted on the Harford County website. The property is more than 33 acres, and it is between Route 24 and Route 924, bordered by Plumtree Road at the north end, according to Miner. People asked him a number of questions about the project, expressing concerns about matters such as the impact to traffic on Route 924 and whether the apartment units would be open to low-income tenants. A makeup date for the community input meeting has not been set yet, but a notice will be sent out, via methods such as signs posted on the property and newspaper advertisements, at least two weeks before the new meeting date, Miner said. The property, which is mostly wooded, was slated in 2012 as the location for a 186,000 square-foot Walmart store. The retail giant announced in 2015 that it would no longer pursue plans to build there, though, after running into several years of sustained opposition from the surrounding community, a requirement of $6 million worth of traffic improvements from the county government, and the expiration of Walmart’s contract to purchase the site. Richlin events postponed An Extreme Family Outreach event scheduled for Friday at Richlin has been postponed to June 6, and a Saturday event for the Hickory Hornets U12 baseball team also has been postponed, but a new date was not indicated on the sign posted at the main entrance. Hogan announced Thursday that gatherings of more than 250 are prohibited in Maryland, one of a series of measures put in place by the state government to limit the spread of novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. The respiratory disease has sickened more than 1,200 people and caused 36 deaths so far in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. “Certainly, we want to follow the guidelines and the stipulations set forth from [the governor’s] office,” Steven Vitali, owner of Richlin, said Thursday. There have been 12 confirmed cases in Maryland as of Thursday, including one in Harford County. The most recent case, affecting a Prince George’s County man, was determined to be spread by community transmission, meaning the illness is moving from person to person in the community, rather than being picked up through travel abroad. The governor and other state leaders announced multiple measures to halt the spread of COVID-19 such as the closing of all public schools for two weeks, starting Monday. Senior centers also have been closed around the state, and Harford County Public Library branches canceled programs and events, and opted to close to the public late last week. Jury trials also have been postponed in federal and state courts, and major sporting and community events have been canceled or postponed. Vitali, who has been with the Richlin event center since 1989, said “we have not encountered anything of this nature” in the past. Events at the facility have been affected by inclement weather, “but not illness-related scenarios,” he said. Richlin is still open for smaller events, and staff can work with event organizers regarding their choices. The facility typically hosts five to a dozen events a week in March and April, depending on the type and number of people involved, according to Vitali. Employees have been keeping the center sanitized even before the governor’s announcement, and “we will continue to do that,” Vitali said. People can call 410-671-7500 or visit the Richlin Catering & Event Center page on Facebook for more information. “We certainly want everybody to be healthy and not put anybody at risk, especially our staff and our clients,” Vitali said.

Will there be enough child care centers when the coronavirus pandemic is over? | COMMENTARY
.W
In normal times, child care is the backbone of our nation’s economy; without it, millions of parents cannot go to work or attend school, and our economy would suffer. But these are not normal times and the spread of COVID-19 threatens our child care system on multiple fronts. Unfortunately, this crisis will very likely cause thousands of child care providers across Maryland to close forever, leaving scores of parents without child care when the economic recovery begins. Thousands of licensed and regulated child care providers in Maryland have stepped up to care for the children of health care workers, first responders and other essential personnel — allowing those brave individuals to help serve the rest of us during this critical time. These child care providers are trying to effectively and safely care for and educate children of essential personnel, while at the same time protect their staff and cover operating expenses to keep their doors open. Screening procedures are in place, but asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission reports cause legitimate concern that a child care facility serving the children of essential workers could be the epicenter of an outbreak among children. Providers need cleaning supplies and protective equipment for daily operations, not just in a pandemic. Yet, following the Maryland State Department of Education’s direction, child care centers have made requests to the Maryland Emergency Management Agency for supplies which have gone unanswered. The financial realities for these very small businesses and nonprofits are stark, even for those open serving children of essential workers. Bills for food suppliers, insurance, landlords and most importantly, the wages of working staff do not stop. A weeks-long lag in the state payment for care of children of essential workers is untenable and unreasonable. Providers are essentially fronting the cost of the state’s pledge to provide child care to essential workers. The state needs to speed up payment or allow essential workers to pay directly and reimburse them later. By the time payments are processed, it may be too late. Some parents and officials have also raised concerns about child care payments, contracts and “guaranteed placement,” or holding their children’s spots for once the crisis abates. Providers — many of them very small women-owned businesses — are doing their best to stay afloat, but they are not immune from layoffs and other financial strains in their own families that make it harder. While they vary, the majority of contracts allow families to terminate. Providers are being flexible and reasonable; many have already worked with families to reduce tuition for those that can’t attend and released families that have been furloughed from their contract obligations. The issue of “guaranteed placement” is harder. Adding children of essential personnel complicates this issue further because it throws off strict state-mandated ratios of staff to children. Above all, unless they continue to receive income from contracted families or other public support, no provider can offer any post-crisis guarantees of placements because none of them can guarantee their businesses will be open after the crisis. The Maryland State Department of Education is apparently considering a solution to provide “financial relief to families” that seems to guarantee placement. But this policy, without financial support for providers, could force child care in Maryland to cease to exist as we know it. Last year there were approximately 7,200 child care providers serving more than 152,000 children in the state. The early data show one third of Maryland child care providers and almost 50 percent across the country say they will not survive even a two week disruption without significant public support. Thus far, federal and state government attempts to help child care providers specifically, and small businesses generally, seem to be insufficient to meet their unique needs. And while providers would like to do more for their employees — they simply can’t afford it. Numerous other states have instituted fiscal supports, recognizing the child care need during the crisis and the long-term recovery. Some like Vermont have instituted plans to reimburse providers for lost tuition. Maryland must consider something similar. Without more support, thousands of parents will not have child care when they need it most. Even some of the thousands of providers who have stepped up to care for essential workers’ children may be forced to close entirely. Child care is not an economic accessory, it is essential. Our state’s leaders need to understand that without child care, our economic recovery will suffer huge setbacks. These child care providers need help now so they can be there for families when everyone goes back to work. Christina Peusch (info@mscca.org) is the executive director of the Maryland State Child Care Association which represents 4,400 infant, toddler, and pre-kindergarten community-based providers.

Tens of thousands of Maryland students have missed lessons since schools closed for coronavirus
.W
Tens of thousands of Maryland’s public school students haven’t made the transition to distance learning despite efforts by their teachers and educators to connect with them. A recent survey of school superintendents showed that as many as 25% of students in some districts either had not signed on to the internet to do lessons or hadn’t picked up a packet of papers to complete since schools closed last month due to coronavrus. Some districts reported they had connected with all but 1% of students. Although some of the students just haven’t shown up for virtual school, school officials say their attendance could be complicated by many factors. The highest poverty areas of the state — where students are less likely to have their own laptop at home or reliable internet — have the highest percentage of students who have lost their connection to school. In some of those areas, students also have to travel to pick up paper lessons. The survey, gathered by the Public School Superintendent’s Association of Maryland, polled districts between April 7 and April 13. “I think it is important to point out that it is just a snapshot. We were all in various stages of rolling out our learning plans,” said Dan Curry, the superintendent in Calvert County and president of the Maryland association. In Baltimore City, as the system undertook what one principal called “a herculean effort” to buy new Chromebooks and hand them out in the past two weeks, about 75% of students have engaged online. The school system does not have data from charter schools, so it is unclear exactly how many students have been doing school work for the past month. In Baltimore County, about 19% of students — at least 20,000 children — had not signed onto the school district’s learning system, including a large percentage of elementary school students. The numbers are likely to change quickly as the system distributes 10,000 laptops beginning this week to students in grades three through five. The school system already had the laptops in the schools, but they weren’t taken home by students. Howard County started its distance learning after most other counties, and no students were getting lessons online during the period of the survey. However, school officials reported they have been in touch in some way with 99% of students. Anne Arundel County has about 10% of its students who haven’t shown up for digital class and the school system hasn’t been able to get in touch with. For Carroll County, the figure is about 1%. In Carroll and Harford counties, where there are fewer laptops available, a larger percentage of students are learning with paper packets from school. In Harford about 88% learn online, and the school system has mailed packets to the remaining students. In Carroll, about 19% of students receive packets. Adjusting to the new form of learning has been difficult for families, but schools always have had staff who checked on students with poor attendance. Harford County’s head of student support, Bernard Henninger, said teachers are making the initial outreach to students to try to get them engaged, but when that fails social workers and pupil personnel workers are reaching out with emails and phone calls. In some cases, Henninger said they are just trying to find out whether a family needs help connecting to the internet, in other cases, they want to make sure the family doesn’t have a crisis the school system might be able to help with. In normal times, social workers would make visits to a student’s home, but Henninger said given social distancing measures those visits have been put on hold. In Frederick County, about 99% of students already are learning remotely, one of the highest percentages in the state. The 44,000-student system already had a device for every child, had ordered 1,000 internet hot spots and began planning for a school closure before it happened. Superintendent Theresa Alban said the system worked with the union to give teachers seven hours of intensive training in remote instruction and then passed out another 3,000 computers to students without devices at home in March. “I think districts who had already started one-to-one had a definite advantage,” Alban said. Districts like Baltimore City and Prince George’s County that bought devices this spring had to configure them after delivery with software that works with the school system’s learning platform and prevents students from accessing inappropriate materials on the web. Prince George’s has reported 20% of its students absent from instruction. The need for technology and connectivity isn’t just a factor of poverty. In some cases, school superintendents said broadband is simply not available in rural areas. Superintendents in Allegany and Talbot counties said some families living along waterfront shorelines or in the mountains have unreliable internet. School leaders are looking for alternatives, such as hot spots that can be mounted on the outside of school buildings to allow students and teachers to drive up and connect. While the so-called attendance survey is a snapshot of progress school systems in the state have made toward switching to a radically new way of delivering their lessons, school leaders have said they haven’t yet determined whether students are really engaged in learning. The survey counted a student as learning if they had signed on once or picked up a packet at a food distribution site once. Alban said the next step is getting a sense of how consistently students are doing the work. He told a story about a math teacher walking through a downtown park in Frederick who saw a student from afar who waved at him. Alban said when the teacher asked the student why he wasn’t participating in his class, the middle school student said, “You mean I am supposed to do math too?”

Maryland businesses will need more than a federal stimulus to recover from coronavirus pandemic | COMMENTARY
.W
The impact of COVID-19 on Maryland’s economy and quality of life has been significant and will cause the state’s economic recovery to be fragile. That’s because, unlike many states, there are more small and mid-size businesses in Maryland, with roughly 90% of people working for companies with 500 or fewer employees. Big public companies are well capitalized and have access to capital markets, credit facilities and cash. The smaller companies that drive Maryland’s economy tend not to have these resources. Further complicating the situation is the fact that key state industries — health care, hospitality, tourism, education, technology and services — are among the industries that have been hardest hit by the economic fallout caused by the pandemic. Compared to other states where large corporations make up the bulk of businesses and big tech firms, agriculture, oil and gas, mining and automotive industries often drive the economy, Maryland’s economy is more locally based. Even government contracting, a vital state industry, will ultimately be impacted as the bills come due to pay for the fiscal stimulus measures being implemented by the government. The CARES Act, the bipartisan federal $2.2 trillion economic relief plan, will be an essential lifeline, especially for Maryland’s small and mid-size businesses. The legislation will provide badly-needed help to millions of American businesses and industries if it’s well executed. But to address the emergency — and take full advantage of the government funding that will be pumped into the economy — Maryland businesses must be nimble and think strategically about their missions and what may lie ahead. Businesses must begin thinking of new, innovative approaches to better serve their customers in the current environment and be proactive in strategically planning for the future. We’re already seeing many Maryland businesses innovate ways to keep their cashflow alive and retain some employees on their payroll. Local restaurants are not only providing curbside pickup of the meals they once served in their dining rooms, but are also selling unprepared foods like produce, meats and fish. Grocery and liquor stores are offering online ordering and home delivery. Family farms are offering contactless pickup of fresh vegetables and fruits. Veterinarians are picking up pets from their owners’ cars to limit contact yet still provide the needed care. What the stimulus package will do for Maryland households and businesses is provide a cushion to help soften the economic blow and buy some time as we slowly work to revive our economy. A return to what we once considered normal is not going to happen right away. In fact, we may not ever get back to that normal and instead we’ll be navigating a new normal. And for the most vulnerable individuals, small businesses and nonprofits in our state, the support the stimulus package offers will not provide enough resources and protection. For the middle-market businesses that drive a lot of Maryland’s economic activity, cash flow is key. Right now, businesses are trying to keep employees on payroll, or at least provide benefits, if they’re unable to operate or have severe cash flow issues currently. Through expanded unemployment measures in the CARES Act, the state can provide some level of benefits to laid-off or furloughed employees as workers can get four months of increased unemployment payments. This will allow people to pay bills and rent, provide for their families and preserve their credit ratings while they’re temporarily out of work. For many small businesses, this may indirectly be the most significant piece of the stimulus package since it supports the purchasing power of consumers. What business owners can do now is move quickly and manage their operations in a way that will ensure that they are poised to thrive in the future. That means focusing on near-term survival and cutting costs where possible while at the same time rethinking their business model. It also means taking advantage of the assistance offered through the CARES Act, including loans to businesses, payroll tax deferment, favorable tax filing regulations and expanded unemployment benefits. The good news is that we learned from the 2008 recession and the U.S. Congress put together a stimulus package that will do a better job of injecting money into the economy at varying levels to provide stronger support for businesses and individuals. We won’t be able to solve all our problems through the stimulus package, but it will help many people keep their jobs and support their families while helping Maryland industries survive. When the emergency abates, we’re going to see structural shifts in a lot of different industries nationwide and globally. E-commerce, virtual learning and digital workplaces will become more commonplace due to their flexibility, scalability and cost efficiency. Colleges and universities may shift toward more online courses, while K-12 schools will need to reevaluate how they teach and have plans in place for the next crisis. The service sector will expand remote operations, telework and cybersecurity systems will grow, and commercial real estate will face changes as more employees work from home. Some industries will inevitably slow down and others will ramp up. We will need to be nimble and willing to continually assess and revamp our approach to how we’re doing business to survive. Ultimately, the changes we are making today to adjust to this new normal will not just affect us in the interim, rather they will have long-term implications and will even offer new opportunities.

United Way is here to help people with financial difficulties because of coronavirus | COMMENTARY
.W
In central Maryland and across the state and country, the number of COVID-19-infected citizens continues to rise. The measures mandated by state officials continue to become more stringent. And the situations we all find ourselves in, more precarious. The way we are living now — in what feels like survival mode, with limited access to resources and uncertainty about the future, has been a way of life for an increasing number of our residents who live paycheck to paycheck or worse, and struggle just to make ends meet. As businesses continue to shut down, and people begin to lose jobs that are essential to their survival and our economy, the call to help those already living just one emergency or unexpected expense away from despair and financial crisis becomes even greater. For people in these jobs, working from home is not an option. They are often hourly or tip-based workers who rarely receive health insurance or paid sick days. These individuals and families face life-altering challenges as we see businesses and schools closed. They are unable to pay all their bills despite their best efforts, which often include working multiple minimum wage jobs. Even a few lost hours in their paycheck can mean making hard choices between things like bills or medicine, food or gas. Imagine what a few lost weeks or more would mean to them. I’m talking about those in the service industries, not just health care providers, but also those stocking grocery shelves, those making deliveries, those protecting our families and homes each day and night — the list goes on. Many are folks you wouldn’t think of as poor. But they’re making just enough that they don’t qualify for federal assistance, and not enough to afford life’s basic essentials: food, housing, transportation, health care, child care. According to our 2018 ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) Report, they represent 38% of Maryland’s population. United Way’s strength lies in its being able to pivot quickly to address emerging needs and crises in our region. We’re working closely with the Maryland Emergency Management Agency to get the latest information. The 211 Maryland United Way Helpline has seen an average of 1,200 calls a day related to COVID-19. Our 211 staff can answer questions about public benefits and connect those in need of food, health care services, child care, transportation, utility assistance and eviction prevention. Callers also can get information on mental health counseling, job training and substance use recovery. The 211 line also provides us with robust data to quickly identify and address emerging needs. But there is much more to do to tackle the burgeoning need here in Greater Baltimore. As work schedules are cut and more jobs are eliminated as a result of the virus, we know that people need help covering basic life necessities, like rent or mortgage bills, food and health care. In response, we’ve established the COVID-19 Community Fund to help increase the capacity of the 211 Helpline and ensure people get what’s needed, where it’s needed, right now. Please visit uwcm.org/COVIDHELP to support our neighbors who are in so much need right now. In this time of isolation, now is the time for us all to unite to support those who are the backbone of our infrastructure and our local economy. We’ve been here for 95 years to motivate and unite our community. Please join us in assisting those residents of Greater Baltimore who need our help now more than ever. Franklyn Baker (franklyn.baker@uwcm.org) is president and CEO United Way of Central Maryland.

Need exercise? Look no further than your computer, phone, tablet while dealing with coronavirus restrictions
.W
Exercise, exercise, exercise. We all need some and with gyms and fitness centers closed, and with orders to stay home continuing, people are looking for and need ways to stay active. And home is one of best spots. Right from your own home, you can enjoy fitness in a number of varieties from certified trainers in Harford County right on your computers, phones, tablets, etc. “We’re putting on daily workouts, the daily boot camp workout," Jeff Brochu said. The videos are put on Facebook and Instagram. Brochu, along with Richard Simpson and Tom Free, own and operate Get Fit Sports Performance. “We’re going anywhere between 800-1500 views per day. Ultimately, we’d like to expand it. We had a social media page, but I wasn’t on social media at all, until this came about,” Brochu said. “We’re just looking to deliver to our clientele and the surrounding area so that people don’t stop working out. In other words, a place to go, a place to turn to.” Get Fit started nine and a half years ago in the Forest Hill Industrial Park. That center is still open and the owners opened a spot in Havre de Grace about two years ago. The Havre de Grace site is wide open, while the Forest Hill site is divided up some with walls. “We also have sports performance athletes coming through the door, so we have the boot camp, but again, we train athletes as well. We’ve shut the whole operation down,” Brochu said. Carol Frontera is manager of Anytime Fitness in Bel Air. “We’re using Facebook for our daily workouts. We do workouts from home that our certified trainers put out,” Frontera said. The Bel Air gym is one of four in the chain. Other centers are located in Timonium, Shrewsbury, Pa. and Newark, De.. “We share workouts and nutrition, tips on food and recipes and contests and all that stuff to keep our members engaged,” she said. “You can see whose viewed the videos, you can see the number of people that view. Sometimes, some of the trainers will do it and I’ll host a watch party and try to get people to watch live and we can see if people are involved.” So, who’s watching? “From what we are able to see, basically there’s a core group of members that stay engaged on Facebook and look forward to those workouts,” Frontera said. “I think it’s serving at least a purpose to offer them something without a cost associate.” Kim Peters, owner of The Fitness Center of Havre de Grace, is also offering free workouts. The center celebrates one year on May 4. “We are offering 5-6 workouts, non-weight bearing workouts, a week on Facebook and also to any member who contacts me, I will streamline some things for them, especially if they need modification,” Peters said. “I am not doing any personal training, especially with my special clientele because I don’t feel it’s as safe as I would like it to be, so I’m doing it with specific modification for people like that.” Peters says her business was picking up. “My numbers were definitely good and they had actually really started growing in February until the pandemic hit, because we implemented some new classes,” she said. “Also, we were bringing in some new personal trainers, which are still happening. Obviously, just won’t be until we re-open.” It’s a tough way to celebrate a first year. “We had started with some new marketing strategies. Actually, at the end of February we had started bringing in a lot more members, so it really hit hard, obviously it’s right in front of my one-year anniversary,” Peters said. “Our numbers were good and growing." Looking forward, to whenever this might end and gyms can re-open, Brochu and Frontera are both upbeat about business. “I think people, definitely our clients will be on fire to run back through the doors and the surrounding area, the folks that have been tied up, will be excited to get it in and hear about a venture that maybe they never would have if they weren’t home,” Brochu said. “I think we’re gonna see an influx of new members when we open the doors and I think we’re gonna see a huge, huge part of our membership return. I don’t think we’re going to lose too, many members because of this,” Frontera said. “I think people are going to realize that part of being a member of a club or gym or whatever you want call it, is the accountability. You’re not distracted when you come into workout and you get the workout done.” Peters, while hopeful, is a bit more pessimistic. “I’m hopeful. The hopeful part of me, which is the person who opened the business, but there’s also this person sitting here in the middle of an unknown opening date,” Peters said. “It seems like fitness and whole foods and the reality of being healthier is catching on during this, which obviously it should. But, also you’re talking about huge financial hits that people are taking and things of that nature, so are they going to be able to afford to pay for gym membership?” Maybe try Yoga Nishat Bhatti runs Yoga with Nishat. “I do teach around Harford County and I’ve been basically on the yoga journey for about 25 years,” Bhatti said. “Especially during this time, I think it’s really helping me and my private group that follows me. We’ve basically discovered virtual yoga and it’s hard to get on social media, it’s just so much out there.” Virtual yoga is definitely different than a gym or fitness workout. “To connect with people virtually, it’s different, because yoga, one-on-one is a different energy, whereas you have a screen in front of you,” she said. “I think just the discipline of having this virtual community and a routine, it’s helping me and our group to basically just, a bigger picture. It just keeps you grounded.” The group is 15-20 people large. “Throughout the week, I’m offering four classes and a lot of people are working from home, some seniors that are retired, some moms. So different flavors of people to be honest,” Bhatti said. “Because I’m offering it to so many different people, it’s a challenge in the way that you want to keep everybody on a level that they want. Because everybody has a different need.” There are physical and mental health aspects. “The class is an hour long and it starts with an intention that we make individually and then as a group. It’s related to just anything,” Bhatti said. She offers four classes per week. Tuesday and Thursday mornings, 9-10 a.m.; Wednesday evening, 6-7 p.m.; and Saturday morning, 10-11 a.m. “It’s pretty private, I have a group ID. I share it after they reach out,” she said. "It is donation based, very nominal. Nobody is forced, three dollars per class. Bhatti says she doesn’t keep track as she doesn’t want to burden anybody or herself. It’s $3 per class. “Fund is donated to local causes. Overall, just a way to give back,” Bhatti said. If interested, call 443-567-8699. Getting outside Some may choose to walk, run or ride bikes and maybe the most popular and best places in Harford is the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Bel Air. Runners, walkers, bikers and leashed dogs all enjoy this trail which offers differing lengths to suit all people. Kristina Lowery is one of those who enjoys the trail. “It’s close to home. It’s a good workout, it’s a long enough trail to be worth walking it. You can either do the two-mile or the four-mile or walk all the way to end which is almost 6.7 miles,” Lowery said. “You feel like you’re out in the wilderness when you are on the trail. It’s a close way to get out of city, the hustle and bustle.” Lowery says she met friends and walked since the social distancing changes were put in place. “As long as people keep their social distance, it’s going to be ok,” she said. “I’ve seen a lot of families, I have never seen so many families on that trail. People are wearing masks, people are very aware of how close or far they are to you.” Like many though, working at home or in the office means sitting. “I sit all day at work and I know I need to get out and stretch,” Lowery said. The Havre de Grace Promenade is another spot for walkers and joggers to enjoy. Recent changes, though, have all people entering at the City Yacht Basin entrance and exiting over near the Concord Point Lighthouse. All people are restricted to walk, run one direction with social distancing in play. People can return to the yacht basin by using Lafayette Street, Market Street and Commerce Street. Only service dogs are allowed on the promenade. A virtual race Blue Cheetah Sports Timing organized a virtual Bunny Run 5K last weekend, according to Andrea Gilde, Director of Marketing and Compliance “We did the Bunny Run in Aberdeen and we ended up having about half of our normal participation. We’re giving out medals to everybody and collecting results and we’ll be publishing those results in a similar way to what we do in a normal race,” Gilde said. Gilde says participants will submit pictures, times, photo of sports watches and things like that to show that they did the time and the distance. “The Bunny Run is a tradition for a lot of people who want to keep that tradition going,” she said. “We felt that given the current guidelines, certainly they were encouraging people to go out and get exercise. People could really run the race wherever they felt most comfortable doing that,” Gilde said. “Some local to Aberdeen reported they ran the same course. It really was up to the participant about where they completed it and when they completed it.” Gilde is still collecting results and probably will until the end of the month. The results include people from other parts of the country who registered for the race. “I wanted people to have fun with it and continue the tradition of it,” Gilde said.

Ill patient taken off plane at BWI Airport did not meet criteria for coronavirus testing, Maryland officials say
.W
State medical officials in Maryland say a patient who had recently traveled to China and was showing flu-like symptoms was taken off a Southwest Airlines flight at BWI Airport outside Baltimore on Saturday afternoon, but did not meet federal criteria for coronavirus testing and has since been released after further medical evaluation. “The person did not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for 2019 novel coronavirus testing but was referred to a medical facility for evaluation to determine whether additional follow-up was necessary. Per guidance from the CDC, no special action was indicated for this person or for any other passengers or crew on the flight,” the Maryland Health Department said in a statement. “Following evaluation by medical personnel, the person was released.” The person was on Southwest Flight 2889 from Las Vegas to Baltimore, which arrived at BWI around 2 p.m. In its own statement, Southwest said that crew had asked for local medical personnel to meet the flight at BWI given the passenger’s symptoms. “Out of an abundance of caution, and in light of the recent concerns of the coronavirus, our Crew followed recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control for responding to concerns to ensure the Customer, and those traveling with them, receive the assistance or support they may need,” the airline said. The airline directed all other questions to the state health department, as did a spokesman for BWI. The health department did not identify the passenger, but said they had previously been “screened and cleared” in Mexico and again in Las Vegas prior to boarding the flight to Baltimore. The new virus, which can cause pneumonia, first broke out in Wuhan, China, and has killed dozens of people in China. More than 1,000 people have been infected. Maryland has not had any confirmed cases of the virus. There have been confirmed cases in Washington state and in Illinois.

88 at Genesis Loch Raven Center test positive for the coronavirus as it prepares to serve as a hospital overflow unit
.W
A total of 70 residents and 18 staff members at Genesis Loch Raven Center in Parkville have tested positive for the coronavirus, now that the operator has tested everyone, a Genesis HealthCare spokeswoman said Friday. Four residents have died from complications related to the COVID-19 illness since the center first announced the outbreak in early April. The post-hospital rehabilitation and long-term care facility will begin providing overflow capacity for overcrowded hospitals beginning Monday. “We’re in full support of the ... multiple hospital systems who are asking for our assistance,” said Lori Mayer, the spokeswoman for Genesis HealthCare. Patients recovering from COVID-19 who need post-acute care will be transferred to the 113-bed facility on Emge Road off of Joppa Road. Mayer said the facility has been authorized by the Maryland Department of Health and Baltimore County Department of Health to house patients from hospitals in the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine. Availability of personal protective equipment will be the “guiding factor” on the admission of new patients, Mayer said in an email. Mayer did not say how many patients initially will be transferred. She added the facility is not currently receiving reimbursement for the added cost of housing new patients. “We believe it’s the right thing to do,” she said, but “it is very costly to do a move like this." Of the nursing home’s 92 residents, those who have tested negative will be transferred to another Genesis facility in Baltimore County designated as the health care provider’s “COVID negative” building, where they will be quarantined for 14 days, Mayer said. Patients transferred to the Loch Raven Center will be discharged to their homes or transferred to nearby Genesis facilities once they test negative for COVID-19. The 21234 ZIP code in Parkville that includes Loch Raven Center has the second-highest concentration of coronavirus cases in Baltimore County, with 136 confirmed cases Friday, according to state ZIP code data. Residents at Loch Raven Center confirmed to have contracted the virus make up more than half of those cases. Baltimore County Councilman David Marks, whose district encompasses Parkville, said he was not made aware of the nursing home’s use for hospital overflow and was concerned about an influx of coronavirus patients to Parkville given the facility’s location near residential neighborhoods. “I trust the judgment of the medical professionals and those who are dealing with the coronavirus,” Marks said, “but on the other hand there needs to be better communication with the County Council members and the neighborhoods they represent.”

Now might be the time to watch ‘The Wire’: Show triples audience during coronavirus pandemic, HBO says
.W
People finally got tired of saying “no, not yet” when asked whether they had watched “The Wire.” The Baltimore-based TV show has tripled its audience since the coronavirus started rapidly spreading, according to a Medium article posted by HBO on Tuesday. The media organization said the television industry saw a 20% boost compared with the previous four weeks and that the time spent watching HBO was up more than 40%. Most viewers are watching at least three HBO episodes every day, the company said, which is a 65% increase from the previous four weeks. As local and national officials attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, people are encouraged to stay at home, keep gatherings to fewer than 10 people and practice social distancing. “In times like this, television can be a powerful tool to bring people together emotionally when they are not able to be together physically,” HBO said in the Medium post. “We’re encouraged that these elevated numbers indicate that people are taking isolation efforts seriously, and we hope that continues to be the case.” There are 531,708 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. That includes 85,505 in the United States and 580 in Maryland. The Ringer announced Wednesday that a new podcast focused on “The Wire” will be released next month. The podcast, called “The Wire: Way Down the Hole,” will be hosted by The Ringer’s Van Lathan and The Atlantic’s contributing writer Jemele Hill.

As medical marijuana dispensaries change procedures amid coronavirus panic buying, Maryland shop owners fear supply chain shortage
.W
Maryland’s medical cannabis dispensaries have seen booming sales amid the coronavirus pandemic even as they’re forced to change the way they serve patients. Dispensary operators say the panic-buying is exacerbating supply chain bottleneck and causing some to fear the long-term effects should the increased demand continue. “Every store in the state is busier than they’ve ever been,” said Mitch Trellis, owner of Remedy Columbia in Howard County. Patients — many sequestered to their homes — have been stocking up as their monthly prescription limits allow. Growers say the challenges they’re facing are the same issues hampering businesses all over the world regarding “human capital,” said Mackie Barch, chairman of the Maryland Wholesale Medical Cannabis Trade Association and president of the Baltimore-based Culta operation that grows, processes and dispenses medical cannabis. “All of our [association] members are experiencing human resource issues,” Barch said. That means less man hours as employees with no available babysitter call out to watch their kids, or socially distance to avoid potentially infecting elderly parents, all while managers try to stagger growers’ schedules to adhere with state guidelines prohibiting close gatherings of more than 10 people, Barch said. “It’s not making the production of cannabis any harder; it’s mostly the post-harvest production and delivery that’s a little bit more challenging,” he said. “This could create some longer term shortages but so far vendors have been great about getting our dispensaries what we need,” said Ashley Chase, general manager for Mission Dispensaries, which operates four facilities in Maryland, including locations in Hampden and Catonsville. David Torres, communications director at the Natalie M. LaPrade Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission, said the regulatory body has not been contacted by patients or license-holders with concerns about supply issues. “Medical cannabis growers and processors continue to increase production each month,” he said in an emailed response. Maryland’s supply chain had already been bottlenecked, Trellis said, facing a rapidly increasing number of registered patients while those who successfully competed for the limited numbers of growing, processing and dispensary licenses worked to build out a new industry plagued with fits and starts from the outset. Maryland added more than 3,700 new patients each month of 2019, according to an industry analysis by consultant Beacon Economics. Patients now total more than 95,000 in the state, according to the cannabis commission. “The shortages are coming,” Trellis said. “I don’t think that the demand has tapered off." At Curio Wellness, a Lutherville-Timonium dispensary that also grows and processes cannabis, “our ability to fulfill orders hasn’t changed" despite the increase, according to chief executive officer Michael Bronfein. “We have no issue in meeting demand.” But the concern over supply is “absolutely” legitimate, said Michael Piermont, Chief Revenue Officer at LeafTrade, an online platform that connects licensed growers with medical dispensaries. “If you were to essentially stop sales today, there would already be more sales [from dispensaries buying inventory] in March than there were in all of February” before the U.S. began ramping up measures to curb the spread of the novel respiratory illness, Piermont said. Through LeafTrade, used by the majority of Maryland’s 15 cultivators and accessed by 92 state dispensaries last week, Piermont said the average order has increased by about $3,000 from February to March, with dispensaries across the U.S. buying more product, and buying it more frequently. “There’s only so much inventory,” Piermont said. “If you’re buying Pepsi and you want more Pepsi, [a factory] can make more. You can’t just make more cannabis. It has to grow and be extracted and dried." That process can take up to six months for cannabis flower to reach dispensaries, Trellis said. “Cultivators are being smart by holding back a little bit of inventory because people are overbuying — just like toilet paper,” Piermont said. “Getting product before [the pandemic] for high volume stores was not easy,” said Michael Tese, general manager at Gold Leaf in Annapolis. “So now I believe it’s definitely gonna get worse if the amount of demand increases.” Industry members say the demand results from increased anxiety spurned by the pandemic, and, before Gov. Larry Hogan declared which non-essential businesses must close Monday, a fear that medical cannabis facilities would be shuttered, given the murkiness of state regulations versus federal law that deems cannabis a Schedule I drug. “Last week, people were really concerned that they couldn’t get their medicine in a timely manner and what would happen if we were just to shut down,” said Gina Dubbe, owner of Greenhouse Wellness in Ellicott City. On Tuesday, after Hogan’s announcement, Dubbe said “we are not seeing the bigger and heavier crowds that we did. People I think are more confident that their medicine will be deliverable to them.” Changing how they deliver Medical cannabis since its inception has been regulated on a state-by-state basis, “which is really the way the whole cannabis industry is being run now,” said Jim Reis, director of business development at the Baltimore-based law firm Offit Kurman, which works with cannabis industry members. Nationwide, cannabis advocates say the pandemic is highlighting the need for federal regulations of the cannabis industry. Eighteen states that have legalized cannabis for medical use have declared dispensaries to be an essential business, while several states have yet to decide if dispensaries should remain open, according to Americans for Safe Access, a medical cannabis patient advocacy group. Direction from those states on how dispensaries should serve patients varies though, with some allowing telehealth services, other states adjusting the number of caregivers and limiting the number of patients who are allowed to purchase, and other states that are authorizing delivery or curbside pick up services for the first time , said Debbie Churgai, interim director for Americans for Safe Access. “What this points out is why federal oversight is really needed,” Churgai said. “Even in this crisis, it shows we really do need something that gives medical cannabis patients consistent access to their ... medicine.” In Maryland, individual businesses have been rolling out new policy changes, following guidelines laid out by the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission which: Authorize telehealth for certification renewal  Suspend requirements for patient signature  Suspend deli-style sales and sniff jars  Extend expiring registrations until 30 days after the state of emergency is terminated  Authorize curbside delivery  Temporarily reduce or stagger staff, alter business hours, implement enhanced cleaning procedures, use order-ahead features, implement delivery or curbside pickup  Post Maryland Department of Health COVID-19 signage. Dispensaries have implemented the restrictions at varying degrees. Some facilities like Remedy Columbia and Rise Joppa, located in Harford County, have barred patients from the building altogether, asking customers to place orders online and wait in their cars for curbside service, a newly authorized delivery method. Remedy Columbia and Rise Joppa have also cut down staff and nixed the daily deals common in medical dispensaries. Curio Wellness, which does not yet offer delivery or curbside pick-up, has limited visitors allowed in the waiting room to just five, and has taken extra measures by installing glass partitions between employees and patients at counters and putting down “social distancing tape” to keep patients at a 6-foot distance from each other on furniture, at every cash wrap counter, at the patient check-in desk in the waiting room outside of the dispensary, and on the sidewalk outside while patients wait in line, Bronfein wrote in an emailed response. At Greenhouse Wellness, along with wearing gloves and masks and disinfecting surfaces every two hours, bud tenders are reserving some inventory for hospice patients in case a supply chain shortage or circumstances in the ongoing pandemic prevent the dispensary from restocking, Dubbe said. While dispensaries reported more average sales Tuesday, Tese said demand at Gold Leaf “definitely hasn’t decreased by any means yet. But I’m sure as people become used to the new normal ... they’ll stop panic buying.”

From the Avenue to the cosmos, Hubble Telescope project enlists Hampden workers in Baltimore affected by coronavirus
.W
Food, drink and retail businesses throughout the trendy Baltimore neighborhood of Hampden took major hits when the coronavirus pandemic forced closures. Starting Monday, many of those unemployed and underemployed workers will get a chance to work on a project that helps astronomers better search images of outer space. The Hubble Image Similarity Project is an initiative of the Baltimore-based Space Telescope Science Institute, which operates the science behind the famed Hubble Space Telescope. Joshua Peek, an associate astronomer at the institute, said the project grew out of a desire to better search its immense database of images. So far, he said, scientists typically search metadata associated with the images to find similar photos taken by the Hubble Telescope, a model of which sits in the institute. Peek, who has a background in both astronomy and image processing, wanted to use neural networks — algorithms that seek out existing patterns — to improve upon the existing methods. “The problem is, the neural networks that exist right now are really good at looking at a picture of a chair and seeing that it is a chair and not a cat, or a cat and not a dog, or whatever," Peek said. “But we don’t have that information for space.” Peek’s research requires other eyes to make sure that images are being categorized correctly. Recognizing this need, he reached out to the nearby Hampden neighborhood to seek out volunteers who could tell whether certain images of galaxies and stars looked like other images of space. Conversations with area restaurateurs led him to Lou Catelli (real name: Will Bauer), who is informally called the “mayor of Hampden.” Catelli quickly began recruiting people through community organizations and businesses, as well as social media outlets like the Hampden Neighbors Facebook page. “My job was super easy: just connecting everybody [involved] quite quickly, because they’re going to ramp up quick,” Catelli said. It works like this: Workers log onto the website that Peek and his team set up, click on similar images when prompted, and receive about $20 an hour for their work. Payment is sent through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing marketplace, and the team hopes to pay around $2,000 to each worker over the next month or two. Peek said he’ll start contacting participants Monday. One of those waiting for possible confirmation, Peter Treadway, learned about the opportunity from Catelli. Treadway works as a line cook at Nepenthe Brewing Company, close to the Avenue, and lost shifts due to the closures. “I have a huge admiration for the Hubble Telescope projects, and I’m very interested in science and astronomy,” Treadway said. “It seems like a really cool program.”

Maryland’s coronavirus cases see record increase for third straight day, 580 confirmed in total: ‘We are only at the beginning of this crisis’
.W
For the third straight day, Maryland’s total of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus climbed by a record amount, surpassing 100 new cases in a day for the first time. The state reported 157 new cases of the virus Thursday morning, more than the sum of the increases of 61 and 74 cases the respective two days prior. Thursday’s spike brought Maryland’s total case count to at least 580, an increase of 37% from Wednesday, which is also the state’s largest one-day rise by percentage. There are more than 1,200 confirmed cases in Maryland, Virginia and Washington D.C. combined. “We are only at the beginning of this crisis, in our state, in the National Capital Region, and in America,” Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement. “As I have repeatedly stressed, we should continue to expect the number of cases to dramatically and rapidly rise.” In his statement, Hogan also made reference to the 42,000 Marylanders who filed for unemployment last week. “Today, we are also seeing an unprecedented increase in the number of Marylanders filing for unemployment," Hogan said. “We are going to do everything we can to help people and small businesses get back on their feet.” Although the state is working to report its number of negative tests, it has yet to do so, meaning it’s not determinable whether the virus’ spread or increased testing for it is causing the daily climbs. However, Thursday marked the first day Maryland has reported its number of virus-related hospitalizations, with 132 total during the virus’ run, as well as the number of confirmed cases released from isolation, announcing 23. Nearly 80% of Maryland’s cases fall into the wide age range of 18- to 64-year-olds. The majority of the remaining one-fifth of cases is among those who are at least 65 years old, with 113 cases among the group considered most at-risk to the effects of the coronavirus. There are six cases in those who are under 18. Thursday, the state reported the cases broken down by gender for the first time, with 298 cases in male residents and 282 cases in female residents. Four of Maryland’s cases have resulted in death. The victims have not been named, but state officials identified three as men in their 60s with underlying health conditions, with two in Prince George’s County and the other a resident of Baltimore County. The fourth victim, a Montgomery County woman in her 40s, also had underlying medical conditions. Montgomery County has the state’s most cases at 164, with Prince George’s County also reaching triple digits Thursday at 101. Baltimore County follows with 81 cases, while Baltimore City is fourth among the state’s jurisdictions with 72. Of Maryland’s 24 counties and jurisdictions, Allegany and Dorchester counties are the only ones yet to report a confirmed case of the coronavirus. Maryland reports its coronavirus case totals daily at 10 a.m., while counties and jurisdictions might report cases outside of the state’s count. “This battle is going to be much harder, take much longer, and be much worse than almost anyone comprehends," Hogan said in his statement. "We have never faced anything like this ever before, and I continue to urge the people of our state to stay in place at home and stay safe. “I want Marylanders to know that if we continue to lead and work together — if we rely on and help each other — together we will get through this crisis.”

‘Love is Blind’-inspired dating during the time of coronavirus program coming to Baltimore
.W
Those who already binged “Love is Blind” on Netflix can soon look forward to a localized version of the popular dating show. According to its official website, “Baltimore is Blind” is part of a broader series of streamed experiences, based on the Netflix program, called “Your City is Blind." It takes advantage of the current self-quarantining people must already do and, like the Netflix show, matches strangers into video conferencing calls so they can determine compatibility via a speed-dating format. It works like this: those interested in following can visit yourcityisblind.com and pay $8 to get an e-ticket. They then sign up for a private Facebook group using their ticket number and, once granted, can watch the program when it begins on April 26. Besides Baltimore, the program has versions for Boston, Philadelphia, Denver, Chicago, New York City and Washington D.C. The series’ three creators are based in the last of those cities, where they work in the media, food and hospitality industries. Beth Cormack, one of Your City is Blind’s co-founders, is a hospitality-focused marketing professional that has run an event series in D.C. and Baltimore called “Pitch a Friend” (“It’s like ‘Shark Tank,' but for single people," she said). After losing much of her business to the COVID-19 pandemic and related closures, she looked to doing something online. “We’re all stuck in quote-unquote ‘quarantine pods,’ people can’t really date right now,” she said. “That’s kind of the idea I came up with. To be honest, I didn’t know how I was going to pull it off, but then I was like, ‘I’m just going to claim this idea before anyone else does,’ and then I just kind of took it and ran with it." She noted that the project isn’t officially connected to “Love is Blind" and she hasn’t run into any issues with the streaming giant behind the original show. “The model in which we do things is different, especially with [how] there’re not actual pods, we’re setting people up on Zoom conference calls," she said. Cormack added that the founders chose cities that had “young, fun energy” where they also had connections. As for Baltimore, she noted that the city has “so much character” and “a lot of pride." “The idea that people are kind of rooted there and feel a huge connection to their city and where they’re from, I think is really cool,” she said. “And I think that’ll be great for ‘Baltimore is Blind,’ because they can all have that kind of in common." Cormack said that the money generated from ticket sales will go towards subsidizing the founders’ own ventures, which lost money due to the pandemic. According to the show’s website, this version has only heterosexual couples, but they’ll look to have LGBTQIA contestants in future versions.

Maryland’s highest court rejects plea to release juveniles amid coronavirus threat, hints major announcement is coming ‘shortly’
.W
The Maryland Court of Appeals denied a petition to release low-level offenders from Maryland’s juvenile facilities, but hinted that the chief judge will issue guidance “shortly” on how lower courts should handle the growing coronavirus pandemic. The state’s highest court issued its order late Friday, hours after the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services confirmed six cases of COVID-19 at detention center facilities statewide Friday. The Maryland Office of Pulbic Defender filed an emergency motion late Thursday, saying the situation inside facilities is deteriorating as the coronavirus spreads. “No event in the past half-century has upended daily life and court operations in Maryland and across the country to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic has,” the public defender’s office asserted in its petition. “The children who were exposed to the infected staff are now spending 24 hours per day in solitary confinement.” That argument wasn’t enough to get the Court of Appeals to act, at least not immediately. In its denial, the court specifically said it was “cognizant” that an court administrative order is on the way. “The Chief Judge will issue shortly an administrative order pursuant to the Maryland Constitution ... which will provide direction and guidance to the Administrative Judges of the respective judicial circuits in connection with important health concerns affecting juveniles committed or detained in facilities in Maryland during the COVID-19 virus pandemic," the order said. Three youths, two staff members and one contractor tested positive for the virus, department spokesman Eric Solomon said Friday. Solomon said the three youths are at the Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, the Lower Eastern Shore Children’s Center in Salisbury and the Alfred D. Noyes Children Center in Montgomery County. All staff and youth have been directed to wear protective masks to minimize exposure and contraction of the virus. In its petition to the high court, the public defender’s office said kids as young as 10 years old have been placed in solitary confinement after being exposed to the virus. The petition asked the court to release most juvenile detainees, amend the conditions of juvenile probation and relocate kids to new places for food and shelter. It is the public defender’s office’s second attempt to get the courts to intervene. The most recent petition noted that conditions have worsened in just the past five days. Jenny Egan, chief attorney for the Juvenile Division of the public defender’s office in Baltimore, said youths in detention centers who were exposed are now in near-24-hour solitary confinement. Her office has said the isolation will have “harmful effects” on adolescents placed in confinement in cells. Egan said in court filings that the state told her there are pending tests for other youths at the Baltimore City, Eastern Shore and Noyes juvenile facilities. “Youth in juvenile jail, especially those subject to stringent physical distancing, are now deprived of the kind of emotional support, reassurance and care that experts say are necessary to weather the emotional harms of traumatic events,” an original petition filed by the office on April 4 says. States around the country have banned the use of solitary confinement for youth, said Josh Rovner, senior advocacy associate with the Sentencing Project. Rovner says that this situation was predictable, after experts have asked for kids to be released from detention facilities nationwide, and that it was only a matter of time until it affected Maryland. “Isolating kids for their own health shows the other failure of Maryland being able to protect these children’s health safety and well-being,” Rovner said.

In it together: Teddy bears, poems and applause bring sense of community to Baltimore amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
Getting home the other morning from a long shift at the hospital, the physician assistant was just at the door of her Fells Point apartment when a passing jogger called out to her. “Thank you!” Hours earlier, the physician assistant, Kendall Barnes, had treated her first confirmed coronavirus cases. For weeks, she and her coworkers at the emergency department of MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center had anticipated the virus’ arrival. Now it was here. The eerie image of an infected lung up on the monitor, up close and real. At work, Barnes and others try to stay calm to reassure one another and their patients. But something in the jogger’s voice touched her. She smiled. She teared up as she opened the gate. By the time she was inside, she was sobbing. “I just felt appreciated,” she said. In ways big and small, Baltimoreans are finding ways to offer help and to lift one another’s spirits in a frightening time: from gathering masks for health care workers, to displaying poetry on chalkboards. Some are organized, with spreadsheets and Google docs where folks can register for help. Or it can be as simple as saying thanks. Amid the common hardship brought by the pandemic, said Barnes, “There’s a great sense of community.” In Radnor-Winston, one resident has taken to inscribing poetry on a chalkboard in her front walkway. Lia Purpura, a poet and University of Maryland, Baltimore Countyprofessor, selects light, uplifting verses — “poems that buoy us” — for joggers, dog walkers and others who pass by. Recently, it was Wendell Berry’s “Peace of Wild Things.” “For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.” Poetry is a good match for the slowed-down pace of life in lockdown, Purpura said. “Poems take a little while to read, you can’t read them the way you would a headline,” she said. Other projects, like the community-led quarantine response network, are more organized. In neighborhoods across Baltimore, residents volunteer to buy groceries and just check in on people who ask for help. In Abell and Charles Village, volunteer Zach Margulies helps to maintain a spreadsheet to connect volunteers with those who need help. He knows that crises like these hurt people on the margins the hardest. When the pandemic first reached the area, he said, “I remember feeling very scared for myself and being paralyzed.” His next thought: “What can I do?” A few elderly residents rely on social media to ask for help. Jack Arnold has been confined to his red brick row home in Patterson Park for weeks. The 81-year old, who suffers from COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lives alone. When he runs out of supplies, he puts out a call on his Facebook page. Recently, he posted a note saying he needed two cans of tomato soup. By the end of the day, four crates full of soup and four more individual cans had been left on his front steps. It was just the first of many such favors. “The whole thing’s been making me feel just ... warm,” he said. Other citizens, meanwhile, are stepping up to respond to the widespread shortage of protective equipment. “Our front-line health care workers are risking their lives to protect the community. We don’t want them to go in without proper protection,” said Han Fang Lim. Along with other parents and staff at Towson’s Baltimore Chinese School, she’s been gathering gloves and masks to donate to local hospitals and urgent care facilities. They started a GoFundMe to buy more, and raised $10,450 in three days. With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommending everyone wear cloth masks in public, Baltimoreans have gotten to work making face coverings for family, friends and neighbors, too. Hampdenite Holly Harris dusted off her old sewing machine for the first time in a decade and searched online for a pattern. She dug up some old fabric she happened to have in the house. “They’re not made with skill, they’re made with love,” she said, holding up a few examples of her handiwork on the front porch of her stone duplex. Through trial and error she’s found that 7 inches by 9, with a triple pleat, works best. In recent days she’s made dozens, giving some to her mother’s retirement community, to neighbors, friends and anyone who needs one. “It feels good to make them.” The sight of so many adults in masks might frighten small kids, says Kim Lane, the director of Pigtown Main Street. In an effort to make the masks less scary, she’s been wearing a mask over a fuzzy pink pig costume she keeps on hand for work. Along with a friend dressed as the Easter bunny, Lane has recently made a hobby of walking through Pigtown and Hamilton-Lauraville, where she lives. They wave to children and parents, careful to keep a six-foot distance. It’s a ridiculous amount of fun. “You should really get a onesie and come out with us," she told a reporter. After days stuck indoors, the sight of a pig and a bunny shimmying to “Happy” by Pharell Williams was a welcome distraction for neighbors. “It was just uplifting,”said neighbor Aaron Robinson, a podcaster who also goes by the name Aaron Dante. His 19-month-old son ran to join the bunny before his parents grabbed him. Some acts can be as small as placing a teddy bear in a window. Neighbors have put them there to entertain children, imitating an idea popularized in parts of Canada and the U.K. “Teddy bear hunts are so much fun,” said 4-year-old Genevieve Black of Roland Park. Lately, she’s been seeing stuffed animals in people’s windows on her daily walks with her mother, Margaret. “I spied a teddy bear in the window, and Mommy didn’t even spied it and she’s bigger than me. I’m very good at spying things," Genevieve said. “It was yellow. I remember it was yellow.” Why were the neighbors putting teddy bears in the window? a reporter asked. “Because it’s just Teddy Bear Day,” Genevieve said. Other acts of benevolence have also been inspired from European countries, where coronavirus arrived several weeks ago. Residents of London, Paris, and other European cities have lately started a custom of nightly applause to recognize the labor of health care workers. Remington resident Vincent Scellini first heard about the idea during a Skype call with an aunt who lives in Hamburg, Germany. His aunt left in the middle of their call to go clap out her window along with her neighbors. Scellini seized on the idea. Before he even got off the call, he was posting messages about it on neighborhood groups. He thinks of it as not only cheering health care workers for their bravery in responding to the coronavirus pandemic, but for grocery store employees busy restocking shelves, and really, for everyone else, too. Even those who are home are doing something: “holding up and staying strong in our homes.” Each night at 8:57 p.m., Scellini’s phone alarm begins buzzing. He walks outside to the marble steps in front of his Remington row home. At times, his partner and a few neighbors join in. And sometimes, it’s just him. At 9 p.m., alone in the evening air, Scellini claps and claps, until his hands hurt. Baltimore Sun reporter Mary Carole McCauley contributed to this article.

Maryland coronavirus cases up to at least 1,413; D.C. area could be in the ‘next wave of hot spots,’ Hogan says
.W
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 14% as of Monday, state officials said, prompting Gov. Larry Hogan to issue a stay-at-home order for all residents except for essential activities. The rising number of cases in Maryland and the greater Washington, D.C., region, including outbreaks over the weekend at a Carroll County nursing home and a Howard County psychiatric hospital, led the governor to predict on FOX News Monday that the state could see outbreaks as bad as the one in New York, which is nearing 1,000 deaths. In Annapolis, Hogan said the DC-Maryland-Virginia area was reporting 2,709 confirmed cases. “We’re just kind of the next wave of hot spots,” the Republican governor said in the TV interview. The number of COVID-19 deaths in Maryland remained at 15 Monday morning, after rising from 10 Saturday, officials said. The number of confirmed cases in the state was 1,413, as of Monday. The 174 new cases Monday represented a slightly smaller increase than over the weekend, when the nursing home outbreak was confirmed. On Sunday morning, Maryland announced that 247 new cases had been confirmed since Saturday morning, including 72 in Carroll County. Officials at the Clifton T. Perkins psychiatric hospital in Howard County Sunday night confirmed a coronavirus outbreak there involving an unspecified number of both health-care workers and patients. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties continue to lead the state in known cases with 341 and 294, respectively, as of Monday. Baltimore County had 186, Baltimore City had 142, Anne Arundel County had 110, Howard County had 96, Carroll County had 82, Charles County had 33, Frederick County had 26 and Harford County had 24, the state said. Of those confirmed to have the disease, 274 were in their 50s; 262 were in their 40s; 219 were in their 60s; 188 were in their 20s; 139 were in their 70s, and 27 were ages 10-19, the state said. Fifty-two of those with confirmed cases were older than 80 and five were younger than 9. Women represented 716 of the patients, and the other 697 were men, according to the state. The number of negative coronavirus tests administered in Maryland has reached 13,316, and 43 people have been released from isolation, state officials said. The coronavirus outbreak that infected 66 residents and killed one at the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy over the weekend was “tragic,” Hogan said in the TV interview. In addition to the dozens of residents who tested positive and nearly a dozen who were hospitalized, Hogan said 27 employees of the nursing home have symptoms and will be tested for the coronavirus. Hogan repeated his assertion that Maryland could follow in the steps of New York in the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the next few weeks. The rise in cases in Maryland is particularly concerning, given the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who live in the state, the governor said. “It’s quite a crisis, not only for our state, but for the folks who are leading the federal response,” Hogan said. Hogan plans to lead another call with the nation’s governors, the president and vice president Monday. The governor praised Vice President Mike Pence as “terrific” but did not mention President Donald Trump specifically. Given the “tremendous shortage” of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, Hogan said, he’s asked the federal government to distribute “everything in the national stockpile.” The arrest of a Charles County man for hosting a large party, in violation of the state’s executive order banning gatherings of more than 10 people, should send a message to Marylanders that the state is “not playing around” when it comes to enforcing orders to protect public health, Hogan said. “We’ve been taking unprecedented and very aggressive action for 24 straight days,” Hogan said.

Maryland confirms 57 coronavirus cases in state prison system, more than tripling in five days
.W
The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services confirmed 57 cases of COVID-19 in the state’s prison as of Wednesday afternoon, a sharp jump from the 17 reported Friday. The total number of cases includes 10 inmates, 22 correctional officers, three division of Parole and Probation employees, 19 contractual staff, one clinical health employee and two office of the secretary employees, according to Mark Vernarelli, spokesman for the department. The cases are in the Baltimore City central intake area, Jessup, Cumberland and Hagerstown region — with the Jessup Correctional Institution having the highest total of cases for any facility, Vernarelli said. The Jessup facility has 21 cases while the second-most cases were found at the Dorsey Run Correctional Facility. Two cases were found at the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women and four cases were found at the Patuxent Institution. The Maryland Correctional Institution in Jessup had one case confirmed, which was a correctional officer. All of these facilities are located in Jessup. In Baltimore, four cases were confirmed at the Maryland Reception, Diagnostics and Classification Center — all of them among correctional officers. The Metropolitan Transition Center confirmed two cases, one correctional officer and one contractual employee. One case was confirmed at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center. Two cases were confirmed at the Maryland Correctional Training Center in Hagerstown, and one case was confirmed at the Western Correctional Institution/North Branch Correctional Institution in Cumberland. On April 3, staff in all of the department’s correctional facilities were required to begin wearing additional protective gear. The department provided each correctional employee with a face shield, glove and a sneeze guard or surgical mask. Maryland Correctional Enterprises began making equipment “several weeks ago,” a release from the department said, which includes 12,000 sneeze guards, 10,000 plastic face shields, 1,400 gowns and 2,000 bottles of hand sanitizer.

Letters: Candidate for judge, Laura Morton, outlines credentials; Don’t blame Trump for coronavirus — blame him for policy, response
.W
Candidate for judge, Laura Morton, outlines credentials I am Laura Morton, candidate for judge of the Circuit Court for Carroll County. I wanted to share with you and the citizens of Carroll County that I am challenging the incumbent for this position because the citizens of Carroll County deserve to have a highly qualified judge who has the experience and integrity to handle all cases fairly and impartially. It is also important that the voice of the people should be heard. Given the opportunity to retain the current judge in 2018, Carroll County voted the incumbent out of office. His reappointment to the bench overcomes the will of the people. This is neither just nor fair. I am the most qualified candidate with over 23 years of trial experience in civil, criminal and family law. After going through the very rigorous nominating process, I was deemed highly qualified by the Carroll County Trial Courts Judicial Nominating Committee. It is important for a judge to have good relationships with the various agencies that provide much-needed support services to the court and the individuals appearing before it. Being present in the Carroll County courts nearly every workday has allowed me to build these great relationships with the people and agencies that make the court system run well. I have dedicated my entire legal career to ensuring quality legal representation for everyone, regardless of their background, personal situation, or financial status. For me justice for all is not a campaign slogan, but a guiding principle of my law practice. That is why, during my legal career, I have voluntarily provided thousands of hours of free legal services as well as working to inform the community of resources available through various state and local agencies. Being a Circuit Court Judge is the natural next step in a law career devoted to this principle. Finally, I believe representation matters. Carroll County deserves a Circuit Court that reflects the community. After 180 years and many well-qualified female applicants to the bench, there has still not been a woman appointed to the Circuit Court bench. The only way a woman can prevail is by election. That is why I am urging all voters, Republicans and Democrats, to vote for Laura Morton for judge of the Circuit Court in Carroll County in the primary on April 28. Laura Morton Westminster Don’t blame Trump for coronavirus — blame him for policy, response Not that I’m blaming Trump for the coronavirus, but he did try to defund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2018 and he did cut the pandemic response team. He argued against allowing American citizens to leave the Princess cruise ship and go into local quarantine on shore because it would increase the number of cases in the US. Currently there is no plan for the 3500 passengers set to disembark the ship. He urged citizens, even if infected, to go to work. The White House overruled health officials who wanted to recommend that the elderly and physically fragile Americans be advised not to fly due to the virus. Trump disputes data on the WHO’s 3.4% death rate. He says he has a “hunch” that it is much lower. It occurs to me that the guy who lied about crowd size, lied about bone spurs, lied about his wealth and lied about his Ukraine phone call and thousands of other things, might be lying about the coronavirus. We need the truth. We need facts. We need testing. And we need them now. After downplaying the coronavirus outbreak, Pence admitted that there aren’t enough testing kits. If Trump really cared about the American people, he’d direct his coronavirus czar to issue a federal rule that all insurance companies must cover screening and testing without fees or copayments.

Johns Hopkins moves all classes to online, cancels in-person May commencement and vacates campus amid coronavirus 
.W
Johns Hopkins University announced Wednesday that classes will be taken virtually for the rest of the semester, in-person spring commencement has been canceled and all students should vacate campus. The university is the latest among those that have closed their doors in response to the growing coronavirus outbreak. University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar said in a news release that the decisions were a “series of unprecedented steps to safeguard our community and ensure that we can accomplish our mission to care for those we serve, including the most vulnerable among us.” Classes will begin being held virtually in full no later than March 23, after undergraduate students’ spring break, the university said. In-person labs, research for credit and practicums will not be held. The university said it’s providing virtual teaching support for all faculty, lecturers and teaching assistants. Additionally, the provost and dean’s office are working to make adjustments for exams, grading, course credit and degree requirements, among other things. Residential undergraduate students were already required to leave campus. The university said it is working with the Student Affairs department to establish a procedure for people to return to campus and gather any remaining belongings to bring home or move into storage. Students will receive a credit for unused housing and dining contracts, the university said. The university is also now urging students who live off campus to “seriously consider” returning to a permanent residence, because campus resources will be so limited. Student workers on campus are expected to be paid through at least April 12, but the university said it is working to extend the time frame and provide remote working opportunities where available. University-wide commencement, held in May, will be done virtually. Johns Hopkins said it is planning an in-person celebration at a “later date.” Opportunities to walk at future graduation ceremonies will be offered, and the university is also discussing a fall class gathering as part of Young Alumni Weekend. Only critical research will continue to be maintained, the university said, and the vast majority of people are transitioning to telework. The university is also providing emergency COVID-19 leave for employees. The university said all meetings and work activities — even those deemed essential — must be conducted virtually. Any in-person gatherings must be fewer than 10 people, and all nonessential university travel has been canceled. All tours, admission and alumni events have been suspended until further notice, the university said. “Though we will not be together in person for the immediate future, we continue to draw inspiration and strength from this remarkable community no matter where we may find ourselves in the world,” the university said. Notre Dame of Maryland University and Morgan State University, among others, also decided to move to fully virtual classes. Notre Dame has not yet canceled its spring commencement. The decisions are amid the growing outbreak of COVID-19, more commonly known as the coronavirus. At least 85 people have confirmed COVID-19 infections in the state as of Wednesday. Colleges in the University System of Maryland, separate from Johns Hopkins, have told students not to return to campus after spring break and plan to have classes taught online at least until April.

Minnich: Will wisdom prevail over politics in terms of when we return from the coronavirus shutdown?
.W
It’s obvious to me at least that the single most critical difference between people is in their sense of time. This is the kind of stuff that stirs in my head during times like these. Religion, politics, romance, how we measure happiness are all affected by how we measure time, both as individuals and as cultures. Jews, Muslims, Christians all worship the same God, but the differences lie in the issues of beginnings and historical measurements of significant emphasis — the who, what, where and when of defined significant tenets of beliefs. In romance, it’s being in the right place at the right moment with that right person — but timing is everything. You’re ready or you’re not, and mistakes in calculation either way can make all the difference in the rest of your life. Patience is a virtue until it costs an opportunity that may never again present itself. Striking when the opportunity seems right but isn’t can make you a loser, send you to jail, or bring disgrace and self-loathing. To get to the point, let’s do the calculation on the question of when to end the quarantines and let people decide for themselves how much social distancing is necessary, or for how much longer, or whether it should be all in or in increments according to hot spots for the virus that dominates our lives. And here we stir the political pot. There’s no good choice between absolutes. When do we end the stay-at-home policies as a means of preserving health and life? It’s possible to want to get back to work or find another job or even start over and at the same time care passionately about the fate of others. Most of us don’t want to choose between one or the other. We want both, in balance. But where is the balance? We look to our leaders to make the right calculations and set a course. We’d like to think that our elected leaders would weigh the facts and make ethical choices based on good information and moral courage. In short, we want the proverbial wisdom of Solomon, and not the expediency of political calculations of Pilate. Both Solomon and Pilate were under pressure to do the bidding of conflicted constituents. In both cases, the arguments had strong support from rational and traditional thinking. And in both cases, as in our situation today, the difficulty lies in the power of human compassion. Solomon could have said the law is the law, and division of the child is lawful, so be it. Kind of like separating children from parents who tried to cross a border without the proper legal documents. Pilate could have said justice is more important that the law and could have accepted responsibility for the consequences of the actions at hand. But he wavered and calculated. He blamed others and avoided making a choice that would have cost him politically. Time was a factor; the issues were complicated by history and would affect the future of the world, but the choices had to made then and there. What does the world need most: a healthy economy or a healthy population? How much longer should we wait to make the determination that a tipping point, a balance, is at hand? When? The why of it all is mired in reflective rationale of past decisions and values: Mistakes in setting priorities, short-sighted planning, political considerations. As in why don’t we have the resources in reserves to combat a pandemic. It was the old guns or butter conundrum, and guns always have won. Then we come to who makes the decisions. Do we have a Solomon in charge? Or a Pilate? Dean Minnich is a retired newspaper editor and former county commissioner. His email address is dminnichwestm@gmail.com.

Now that coronavirus lockdowns have put an end to Baltimore’s live music, we need it more than ever
.W
Scott and Alisha Patterson, the husband-and-wife duo behind the performance company Afro House, are used to putting everything on the line for their art. Both quit their day jobs in 2014 to realize their vision for Afro House, a multimedia laboratory for projects driven by Scott’s work as a composer and pianist, and knit together by his Afrofuturist aesthetic. At first, it didn’t go well. They struggled to earn enough to keep up with mortgage payments and to keep the refrigerator full for their two young sons. Gradually, the tide turned. Last year, selections from their space-based opera-ballet “Cloud Nebula” were staged at Artscape and Light City. Scott received a Saul Zaentz fellowship through Johns Hopkins to learn how to adapt “Cloud Nebula” for film. And their house concerts, which turned the Pattersons’ living room into a concert venue complete with locally catered food, were a big hit. Just weeks ago, they were preparing for the next Afro House concert in March, which had sold out well in advance. Then the coronavirus hit. By now, we all know the story. Afro House lost multiple streams of income. With the closure of non-essential businesses, creative plans for live shows were indefinitely arrested. And when schools shuttered, the daily rhythm of Afro House’s operations were sidelined by the Pattersons’ need to care for their sons, who are six and nine-years-old. But as the dust of the lockdowns settles and Baltimore prepares for what might be months of mass quarantine, many musicians have found a small silver lining in their disrupted schedules. Now, finally, there is time to focus and reconnect with those impulses that drove them to artistic careers in the first place — even as the financial prospects for their work remain grim. The Pattersons have chosen to view the quarantine, which Governor Hogan elevated to a stay-at-home order as of March 30, as an opportunity to re-imagine the role that art plays in their lives and to nurture their family. “This doesn’t have to be all tragedy,” said Scott during a phone interview. “When [our boys] look back on this time, they’re not going to remember the schoolwork they missed. They’re going to remember what it was to be home with mom and dad.” “Being home with mom and dad” has required some creative thinking of its own. The Pattersons quickly realized that recreating their son’s school schedules while balancing time for Afro House — let alone for themselves — was “unsustainable.” Instead, they’ve tried to imagine how their sons’ educations could overlap with their work. Scott noted that their nine-year-old is “really into making and building things” — so he recruited the boys to help remodel a room into a makeshift film studio for the opera, simultaneously realizing a “dream of them working with [him] on these things.” Alisha acknowledged the uncertainty of the moment. “We know that things have forever changed. But we’re really good at improvisation. We have gone through enough challenges with Afro House to know that we can continue to move forward.” Pianist Susan Zhang is similarly committed to her musical mission, even if that means indefinitely postponing it. She runs the mobile piano duo The Concert Truck with her partner Nick Luby. The Concert Truck is just that: a truck that turns into a stage, meant to “bring people together in outdoor spaces for live music — which is the exact opposite of what we’re supposed to be doing right now,” said Zhang. For her, the quarantine is “a mixed bag of emotions. There is more time to practice, which is always welcome in my life,” she said. But the pandemic put off a 20-state tour planned for the summer that was meant to “connect personal stories of people across the country to classical music.” “I put in so much work over the past five or so months. Now it’s all up in the air,” said Zhang. “That was really hard for me to say we have to put this on hold.” Ironically, at a time when live music may be at its least supported by our daily culture and economy, it is that music that is most helping to support and sustain its makers. “Having routines has been really important for me,” said Zhang. After an initial bout of anxiety, she developed a daily routine of practicing in the morning, teaching piano students remotely in the afternoon, and doing “something social” in the evenings, “even if that's just working out through an iPad with a friend.” And plans for The Concert Truck continue, as Zhang and Luby work to adapt some of their tour repertoire for video. “Now that I have more projects going on, I feel more settled,” said Zhang. “I can have more structure in my day.” That structure can help dim a deeper worry about the long-term recovery of the performing arts once normal life resumes. “The uncertainty about what things will look like and how things will change is certainly bringing me a lot of anxiety,” said Zhang. She noted that a declining economy “affects how non-profits function and whether people give to the arts … even once things supposedly get better.” If there’s anyone familiar with the vicissitudes of a music career, it’s Todd Barkan, who opened up the jazz club Keystone Korner in Harbor East almost exactly one year ago. Barkan has been operating jazz clubs for decades, including opening the first Keystone Korner in San Francisco in 1972 and working as a programming director for Wynton Marsalis at New York City’s Jazz at Lincoln Center. After receiving an NEA Jazz Master Fellowship in 2018, Barkan went “all in” for the club in Baltimore. It’s the only Keystone Korner currently in operation, and Barkan lives in the apartment above the venue. He reported that before the coronavirus lockdowns, Keystone Korner was “just starting to really take off. January and February were the best months we ever had.” The indefinite quarantine might pose the most difficult obstacle Barkan has faced in his career. “It’s doubly challenging because you have the everyday task of putting bodies in seats compounded by health and safety concerns,” he said. In other words, when venues are allowed to reopen, how many potential audience members will still be wary of large crowds? Which Baltimore music organizations survive the coronavirus — and the extent to which they survive — may largely be a function of their financial situation before the quarantines took place. Organizations large enough to have an endowment, for example, face much better prospects. Anthony Blake Clark, music director of the Baltimore Choral Arts Society, is confident the 53-year-old ensemble will persist, despite losing an estimated $100,000 in revenue over the coming months. The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, weathering its 2019 lockout of musicians over budget concerns, reported happier news in the earlier months of the year when it announced plans toward long-term fiscal health that included securing millions in operating gifts and restoring its 52-week concert season. In recent weeks, the orchestra has offered multiple opportunities for audiences to engage with its music online; and, significantly, it has continued to pay its musicians and staff, unlike other massive classical music organizations like the Metropolitan Opera and National Symphony Orchestra. Smaller, independent projects will likely survive because they do not constitute their creators’ sole source of income. Sam Bessen, who founded the concert series In The Stacks (which had previously enjoyed packing its venue “to fire code”) reports feeling “relatively lucky during this pandemic. We don’t own or pay rent to our venue [at the George Peabody Library] and we don’t have any salaried staff.” Bessen is the series’ only administrative employee, and he enjoys a separate full-time job at Johns Hopkins. Without a doubt, the musicians hardest hit by the coronavirus quarantine are full-time freelance performers. In an emailed survey, many Baltimore-based classical performers reported a near-total loss of income. While state unemployment benefits have recently been extended to include freelancers due to the recent passage of the CARES Act, immediate financial relief does not assuage fears about the long-term impact of COVID-19. Seth Kibel, a full-time woodwind specialist, wrote in emailed comments that he worries that “it will take a lot longer for the arts to recover than many other sectors of the economy.” This worry spurred him to create a petition to congress to include arts funding in any future stimulus plans; but that worry has also decimated his ability to find “any iota of creativity. The daily drumbeat of bad news and bad vibes is so overwhelming that I just find myself lacking any kind of creative spirit.” It’s a sentiment that Todd Barkan of Keystone Korner could relate to. He recalled an afternoon a few days ago when he was feeling “immersed in bad news.” Then, he said, he “happened to click on a Billie Holiday song called ‘When You’re Smiling.’ I immediately turned off everything in the apartment and concentrated on Billie Holiday for the next half hour. And that made a world of difference in my life.” Despite everything, Barkan insists that “it’s more vitally important than ever to find time to get lost, and found, in music. [It’s] essential food for the heart and soul.” Elizabeth Nonemaker covers classical music for The Baltimore Sun as a freelance writer.

Orioles announce coronavirus ticket policy, including 125% credit or full refund for home games through May 31
.W
Orioles fans who hold tickets for home games scheduled from Opening Day to May 31 can get either a full refund from the team or have a 125% credit granted to be used at any home game before the end of the 2022 season, the team announced Wednesday. “The Orioles strive to be the region’s most affordable, family-friendly entertainment destination and we certainly understand how difficult these past few months have been for families and businesses in our community,” senior vice president of administration and experience Greg Bader said in a statement. "Beginning today, we will offer our fans several options for all regular season home games scheduled through May 31, which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are hopeful that this policy will deliver significant added value to many of our most dedicated fans, while allowing those with uncertain or difficult circumstances the flexibility they need to make the best choice for their family at this challenging time.” The announcement on the team’s website says that the game credits will be based on face value of the ticket and can only be applied to future game tickets, not parking, concessions or other related services. Those who wish can also get their money back, the team said, and are asked to contact their Orioles representative or call 1-888-848-BIRD to obtain a refund, or go to orioles.com/update to learn more. If fans choose the credit, those will be applied automatically to fully-paid Birdland Members. Those who purchased tickets through Orioles.com or Ticketmaster will be contacted separately, the team said, while those who used other vendors must deal with them directly. Beyond May 31, the team’s update says that Major League Baseball is working closely with health officials and elected leaders to determine how the rest of the season will be impacted. According to the Associated Press, teams got guidance from MLB on Tuesday that they could establish their own ticketing policies in the wake of a federal lawsuit filed last week in Los Angeles against the league, all 30 teams and ticket vendors. Previously, the Orioles’ website had no information on ticket policies for the adjusted season, only asking fans for patience as they worked thorough the problem. For canceled games at their spring training home in Sarasota, Florida, the Orioles refunded all tickets, and Birdland Members who had tickets to the scheduled exhibition game at the United States Naval Academy were also refunded. But without any clear guidance on what would happen with the season, teams were previously loath to commit to anything regarding tickets. League officials are constantly formulating possible plans to play the season in centralized locations in empty stadiums to keep teams in one place and safe amid concerns about COVID-19, but none have emerged as a likely option.

Nearly 60 inmates released from Baltimore jails as judiciary looks to shield against the coronavirus 
.W
Nearly 60 inmates have been released from Baltimore city jails and prisons in the past two weeks after getting new or expedited bail review hearings, the Maryland judiciary said Friday. Those freed were identified by the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office as being low-risk offenders who would not post a public safety threat, according to the Maryland Judiciary Office of Public Affairs. The releases began on March 18 and have continued since. Maryland judiciary Public Information Officer Nadine Maeser said the tally of 60 released is the latest and most accurate account as of Friday. The defendants released were committed to the Baltimore City Detention Center and were awaiting trial. Four individuals were released on Friday, Maeser said. Maeser says the expedited hearings have been occurring daily in the district court. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City is also conducting similar hearings, Maeser said. “Numerous individuals have been released through this process every day,” Maeser said. “The judge will make a decision based on the facts and circumstances of each case, taking into account the recommendation of each attorney and the current situation with the COVID-19 emergency.” The Baltimore City State’s Attorneys Office has since recommended 157 people for release from Baltimore city jails, although a judge will make the final decision. “Three different teams of prosecutors were doing this type of work for the past week,” Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said in an email provided by her office to The Sun.

Will the Orioles take care of concessions workers amid coronavirus? | COMMENTARY
.W
It’s been a month since the Orioles and 29 other Major League Baseball teams announced they would be giving $1 million to each team’s stadium workers. But the 700 concessions workers who serve Orioles fans at Camden Yards have been left out in the cold. They haven’t heard anything from the team or the Orioles’ concessions contractor, Delaware North, on whether they will receive support during this unprecedented crisis. We expect better from the Orioles and the Angelos family. To be clear, we understand and support the MLB’s decision to postpone the season, although we are heartbroken as longtime fans to see baseball delayed. But as Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban put it, how companies respond to the COVID-19 pandemic will “define their brand for decades.” Other teams across the country are already stepping up to the plate in baseball and other sports. The Barclays Center, United Center, PPG Paints Arena, Pepsi Center and Staples Center committed to pay their concessions workers for the remainder of the NHL and NBA seasons. And in MLB, the Red Sox, Giants, Yankees, Padres, and Marlins have all committed funds to support laid off stadium concessions workers. In fact, the Red Sox increased their total aid from $1 to $1.5 million, expanding it to include Aramark concessions workers. The Giants increased their total aid to stadium workers from $1 to $1.7 million, including all third-party vendors, and said donations are expected to continue to increase. Where are our O’s? The hundreds of Baltimore residents who work at Camden Yards are surprised by the lack of response from the Angelos family. In 2015, when our city was in another moment of crisis, the Orioles did the right thing and paid these workers for games missed as a result of the widespread protests following the funeral for Freddie Gray. Peter Angelos is known for being a longtime supporter of unions – siding with players in the 1994-1995 baseball strike. Indeed, he made his fortune as a lawyer representing injured workers in a large asbestos class action. He once told Los Angeles Times Magazine: “The labor movement is responsible for everything good in America. … You have to support your fellow Americans.” The concessions workers at Camden Yards are incredibly vulnerable to sudden loss of income. With unemployment rising at a historic rate and rampant delays in unemployment processing, Maryland officials say there is no clear timeline when laid-off workers could receive extra support from the federal stimulus. In normal times, unemployment processing can already take three weeks. It’s time for the Orioles to stop stalling. Maryland taxpayers put up over $200 million to build Camden Yards. We did so with the promise that the stadium would create good jobs and economic revitalization for Baltimore’s poorest neighborhoods. Now, more than ever, Baltimore needs the Angelos family and the Orioles to live up to that promise. Roxie Herbekian (rherbekian@unitehere.org) is president of UNITE HERE Local 7, which represents the 700 concessions workers at Camden Yards along with thousands of other hospitality workers in the Baltimore region.

Del. Arikan: Legislative tyranny in the time of the coronavirus [Commentary]
.W
The 2020 legislative session started off as they often do: legislators on both sides of the aisle scurrying about to draft their bills, garner support — often bi-partisan, and file their bills before the hopper closed. But as word of a potentially dangerous pandemic hit the airwaves, legislators began to feel nervous, just as every other citizen did. A feeling of concern filled the halls. Staff began wiping down offices with great frequency. I sent my own pregnant chief of staff home after an out-of-state lobbyist came into our office saying she wasn’t feeling well and that she had just gotten off a flight from the COVID-19 hot spot of Washington state. On March 5, Gov. Larry Hogan declared a State of Emergency. Two days later, I found out that I had potentially been exposed to the virus when I had attended the Conservative Political Action Conference to receive an award. The next day, I was told I thankfully did not attend the same day as the positive patient. I began to share my concerns with my colleagues that the leadership was taking unnecessary risks both with legislators and the public. Why wouldn’t they pass the budget immediately and adjourn? I was further dismayed when on March 12, instead of suspending session, all of our staff was sent home, press and lobbyists were barred from entry, and citizens were also forbidden from entering the State House buildings. According to Attorney General Brian Frosh’s website, “Maryland’s Open Meetings Act is a statute that requires many State and local public bodies to hold their meetings in public, to give public adequate notice of meetings, and to allow the public to inspect meetings minutes… the Act’s goals are to increase the public’s faith in government.” The decisions of our House and Senate leadership to continue session without any public participation was a disgrace for democracy everywhere and destroyed public faith. On March 13, Gov. Hogan called on Senate and House leadership to immediately pass the budget and adjourn. What ensued after that day was nothing short of absolute tyranny. While Maryland continued under a state of emergency, an executive order was issued first limiting the congregating of more than 250 people, then later 50 people, under penalty of fines and arrest. In Annapolis, high in an ivory tower, almost 200 legislators and dozens of state employees were still meeting, shuttered away from the public and in clear defiance of the governor’s order. For days, the majority party pushed hyper-partisan bills through both chambers, without regard for citizen participation. Citizens were desperately reaching out while our legislative phone lines went unanswered with no staff present. The live streaming on the House side was totally ineffective, the feed failed constantly, further preventing citizens from knowing what was occurring. Even the audio feed that has been in operation for many years was apparently unable to handle the increase in volume and failed to work on numerous occasions. During committee votes on the House side, no substantive effort to give access to the public occurred causing some legislators to refuse to participate, despite each committee room already being equipped to live stream hearings. In the end, session was finally called early, but far too late. A staffer for the House Environment and Transportation committee tested positive for COVID-19 and had been working in the State House until March 16. I pray that they heal quickly and that no other members of the House or Senate, staff or employees will come down with this illness and spread it to the larger community. This outcome was totally avoidable. What did we the people get for sacrificing access to our representative democracy, for accepting this legislative tyranny? We got an increased tax on tobacco, taxes on online streaming services for Maryland families and a Constitutional Amendment that will appear on the ballot which will give the very same legislators who continued session through the COVID-19 pandemic and a state of emergency even more power to control the budget in the state of Maryland. Maryland’s General Assembly Session 2020 will go down as one of the most egregious attacks on democracy our state has ever seen. Lauren Arikan is a Republican member of the House of Delegates representing District 7.

Maryland National Guard helps provide healthy meals to Baltimore youth during coronavirus outbreak
.W
The Maryland National Guard pitched in with Baltimore City Parks and Recreation Wednesday to help distribute free meals to children and youth ages 18 and under. At least six guardsmen staffed the Herring Run Recreational Center in Northeast Baltimore around noon to pass out the meals. At least 10 people were served over the course of 40 minutes. After Gov. Larry Hogan declared a State of Emergency due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the state’s guard was dispatched to several areas statewide. Lester Davis, Communications Director in Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young’s office said the city was “happy” to have the assistance. “The guard was helpful with staffing and making sure we had a critical mass of people and volunteers to get meals to young people,” Davis said. Specialist Eric Williams, a native of West Baltimore, said the state’s National Guard is serving as “a face” to the community and show support to let people know they are there to help. Williams, who has been with the National Guard for three years, said the meal services are important for the community and he understands that national pandemics can devastate families in need. “We are only here to help, not to make the situation worse for the people here in Maryland,” Williams said. The city first started hosting the free meal events on Monday and the last day is scheduled for Friday, March 27, and thee guard will be there every day until then. The program to feed Baltimore’s children has locations all over the city, including recreation centers, and local churches. Some, including South Baltimore’s Virginia S. Baker-Patterson Park Recreation center and the Mora Crossman Recreation center, are serving breakfast and lunch from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. To find the location closest to you, more information on mobile meal locations can be found here.

With help of robots, Maryland medical school to vastly expand state’s testing for coronavirus — if swabs can be found
.W
As the coronavirus began stampeding across Maryland in recent weeks, scientists tucked away in a University of Maryland research lab in Baltimore got an idea about how to put their high-tech robots to use. They could retool the machinery and significantly increase Maryland’s capacity to test people for COVID-19 — testing that will be critical to any plan to eventually “reopen” the state. The robots can significantly expedite the complex process of analyzing samples taken from Marylanders who get a prescription to be swabbed. The machines can search for the virus’ genetic material in many samples at once. “We knew we could do a lot of tests very quickly,” said Jacques Ravel, associate director of the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The state — which is currently testing about 3,000 people a day — jumped on the offer. The university lab will begin adding tests in coming weeks that eventually could add roughly 20,000 to the daily total. But for all the scientific fire power, there’s a hitch. In Maryland and elsewhere, there aren’t enough basic cotton swabs to take samples from people’s noses and throats. The lack of these supplies may already be limiting the number of tests performed at other labs in Maryland, including one at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and across the country. There are other problems mucking up the works, including lack of other supplies such as the agents used to transport and process samples. More lab capacity is needed, too, and more money to pay for it all. But the dearth of swabs is causing states to scramble, and last week led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to seek an accord with private firms and foundations to produce a polyester-based Q-tip-type swab in bulk. This week, Gov. Larry Hogan is expected to begin to outline the steps in his plan to eventually end some of the restrictions he’s imposed over the past five and a half weeks to limit the spread of the deadly virus. It is sure to involve stepped-up testing. Maryland has tested more than 65,000 people so far, with more than 12,300 confirmed cases and 463 deaths. Compared to other states, it’s not a bad record. Only about 15 states have done more testing than Maryland, including much larger and harder hit states such as New York, California and Florida. Among states of similar population, Maryland has been outpaced by New Jersey and Massachusetts, both hot spots of the pandemic, and Tennessee, which despite its greater testing has identified fewer cases than Maryland. Still, the bottlenecks in testing are a factor in preventing the nation from reopening, officials say. If testing is widespread and people who test positive are isolated, as well as anyone who has been exposed, then others can leave home and return to school and work. Hogan has said the state needs to test more than 10,000 people a day for the coronavirus before he can consider lifting restrictions of businesses or gatherings. That’s more than three times the current rate. In livestreamed remarks Friday to the pro-business Economic Club of Washington D.C., the Republican governor said testing needs to show two weeks of decline in the number of serious cases before restrictions could begin to be lifted. Cases in Maryland were still increasing last week. “We slowed the growth,” Hogan said. “We blunted the curve but we are unfortunately going up. … We believe we’re getting close to the peak in the next week or so.” Hogan said officials would be specifically watching the number of deaths and hospitalizations to know whether the state is getting the virus under control. They want to see 14 days of lower deaths and hospitalizations, not necessarily overall cases, which will rise as testing increases. Once those numbers decrease, lifting of restrictions would need to be done gradually. “None of the governors believe you can just flip a switch,” Hogan said. “I think we’ll gradually start easing things off when we believe it’s safe to do so.” State Sen. James Rosapepe, a Democrat who represents Anne Arundel and Prince George’s counties, said the Hogan administration is right to try to ramp up testing and tracing capabilities quickly. “We’re likely to have vaccines in 2021,” Rosapepe said. “That’s a long way away. We don’t want to wait. The faster we can scale up testing, tracing and quarantining, the faster we can get Marylanders back to work. What nobody knows is: How fast can we do it?” Rosapepe has been researching the cost of such a testing and tracing operation and believes the state can put in place a robust tracing program ― tracking down the people who have been in contact with an infected person — relatively cheaply. He worries, however, whether the costs of widespread testing are affordable without federal funds. “I’m very confident we can get to the levels of testing we need,” Rosapepe said. “But we really need a massive federal investment to scale-up testing if we’re going to get Maryland and the country back to work.” To lift restrictions, and keep a handle on new cases after people begin to return to their normal lives, researchers at Johns Hopkins University say there need to be 750,000 tests nationally a day. The nation is now performing about 125,000 to 150,000 a day. That means gathering samples when people seek care in hospitals or even doctor’s offices, the researchers said in a report released Friday by the Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Testing will also have to expand to people who don’t have symptoms. Most testing now is being done only on patients with respiratory symptoms like coughing or trouble breathing and fever, as well as medical staffs and first responders. Hospitals are collecting most samples, and the diagnostic testing in Maryland is being done by the state health lab, private labs including Quest Diagnostic and LabCorp, plus the University of Maryland Medical Center and other hospitals. Hopkins has been a testing leader with 350 to 650 tests a day. Officials say they could test up to 1,000 a day but are not getting that many samples. “We are testing what we receive,” said Dr. Karen Carroll, director of the division of medical microbiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “We suspect that current volumes will likely increase, especially from our hospitals near the D.C. area.” Hopkins is receiving samples from outpatient tents run by hospitals in its system, as well as from other hospitals in the greater Baltimore area. The daily count varies because the tents aren’t open on weekends. But the lab is also facing shortages in supplies, including testing agents and swabs. “Swabs are now an issue nationally,” she said. “Manufacturers have promised more inventory. The need for high volume testing will continue.” At the University of Maryland, robotic equipment and other testing supplies will be coming in for the next four weeks and staff is being added, partially funded with $2.5 million from the state. The lab in February bought the COVID-19 test developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and began the process of seeking federal approval to perform such tests. It began recalibrating equipment, training staff and developing a process to take in and return the results, which still must be ordered by a doctor. Ravel expects that will change as testing becomes more widespread. The lab plans to use more than one kind of test so if there are shortages with one it can substitute another. It’s been working with the School of Medicine’s Department of Pathology and is just beginning to process some samples. These tests will be on top of the samples already processed by the affiliated University of Maryland Medical System and its 13 hospitals. “The big shortage is still the sampling device, the swab,” Ravel said. “There just are not that many on the market. It’s limiting testing."

In dire financial straits because of coronavirus? Talk to your lenders. | COMMENTARY
.W
Despite serving as the state’s chief tax collector, Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot likes to advocate for individuals paying less in taxes to state government. Whether touting sales tax holidays or cautioning lawmakers to spend less, he generally brags more about the speed at which his staff processes income tax refunds than their skills at collecting record sums. So it came as no surprise that when the COVID-19 outbreak struck these shores, he was soon busy extending the tax filing deadline to July 15 for both individuals and businesses, which, for those who owed the state, offers a slightly better cash-flow situation. The federal government has taken a similar approach on the grounds that in these extraordinary times, the last thing government at any level should be doing is pushing families closer to the financial brink and compounding the nation’s economic woes. But lately, Comptroller Franchot has been offering some additional advice that, while slightly out of his lane, deserves to be amplified. In a recent call to The Baltimore Sun, he asked that people be reminded that further help is available to those who need it. Not just unemployment assistance or direct payment checks from Uncle Sam, as welcome as those might be to those who qualify. Not just Small Business Administration loans, government bailouts to one sector or another or any other formal government program. No, there is one thing average people can do that might hold the secret to weathering the financial storm, to holding onto one’s assets until the household budget is back in balance again. It is simple. It is direct. But for many, it is far from obvious. The comptroller’s advice? If you can’t make your mortgage or car payment and the like, call the lender now — immediately — and discuss what options might be available to you. For some people, that may sound obvious, Personal Finance 101 material. To others, it may be hard to believe that they have any power to negotiate the terms of their debt. What many average people don’t realize, as Mr. Franchot points out, is that mortgage holders, bankers and the other organizations to whom you owe money are just as aware of the economic downturn brought by the outbreak, and it’s in their interest to bridge the gap as well. That doesn’t mean forgiving debt. This is capitalism, after all. But there are tools in their toolboxes such as deferring payments or bridge loans that can mean the difference between bankruptcy or foreclosure or simply extending the terms of your mortgage a few months. The comptroller’s fear (and it’s probably well grounded) is that a lot of Marylanders will resist this option. Perhaps they are unaware of what is possible. Or maybe they are simply too shy and embarrassed. Big companies put pressure on their creditors all the time when events warrant. Individuals living paycheck to paycheck don’t think of themselves in quite those terms which is perfectly understandable. “They may lack the self-confidence and aggressiveness of people who are successful and are used to doing this,” Mr. Franchot says. But here’s what financial advisers frequently warn people facing debt: The longer you wait to talk to those you owe money, the fewer options will be available to you. The stakes are high. In Maryland alone, perhaps $6 billion in monthly payments by Mr. Franchot’s back-of-the-envelope calculations. That’s a lot of money. And here’s the best thing — it doesn’t hurt to pick up a telephone and ask. Landlords may be able to make allowances as well. Not all and not for longer periods, necessarily, but perhaps long enough for the economy to spring back, for people to get back to work, and for something closer to normal life to return. This is not cure-all, of course. Nor a shiny new government program. People have been negotiating debt payments for generations. And it certainly doesn’t address core problems such as the government’s failure to prepare for such a pandemic or how so many American “have-nots” could suffer financial harm so quickly and so disastrously as the “haves” have prospered. But it is sage advice. As Mr. Franchot reports, a lot of bankers have told him they are ready to make arrangements. The first step is to reach out and ask them for help.

McDaniels and writer Peter Jensen — offers opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers. It is separate from the newsroom.

Virtual tip jars, streaming DJ sets: How Maryland’s unemployed dining workers are surviving coronavirus crisis
.W
Nicodemus Bustos and Chris Amendola each have on their hands matching “F” tattoos, a tribute to the restaurant they opened two years ago. To them — the restaurant’s general manager and its chef/owner, respectively — it’s more than a job, it’s an identity and way of life. "We don’t know what to do with ourselves when we’re not at work,” Bustos said. So, not long after they were forced to close, along with every other bar and restaurant in the state, they went back into the kitchen. They decided to use the remaining perishable food in their walk-in to prepare free meals for fellow restaurant workers who, like them, found themselves suddenly with a whole lot of time on their hands. They spread the word using social media. “I think right now, it’s more than trying to succeed as a business. It’s trying to succeed as a community,” said sous chef Taylor Clerkin, standing outside the restaurant, Foraged, on Hampden’s Chestnut Street on Friday evening. The streets were uncharacteristically sparse, with walkers straining to keep a 6-foot buffer from one another. Just over a week since Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan ordered all restaurants and bars to close to dine-in customers, industry workers and those whose livelihoods depend on the industry are experiencing financial insecurity, and fear for the future of a business that’s precarious on the best of days. At the same time, they’re using social media and digital payment services to support themselves and one another until more official forms of assistance like unemployment kick in. Adding stress to the overall situation is the uncertainty. Lack of appropriate testing means that governments aren’t fully sure how big the pandemic is, said Andy Bauer, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Baltimore Branch. But he’s hopeful that the social distancing measures will mean “short-term pain for long-term gain.” Some restaurants have created funds to help their staff. At a few places like those owned by Foreman Wolf and Atlas Restaurant Group, owners are requesting that guests buy gift certificates, with the proceeds going to a fund for laid-off workers. Elsewhere, owners are creating GoFundMe accounts. Rosemary Liss, co-owner of Station North hotspot Le Comptoir du Vin, created an online fundraiser to raise money for staff, including the restaurant’s dishwasher, whose family in Laos depends on her remittances. As of Monday, the fund had raised more than $11,000 of its $25,000 goal. “We are hoping to raise enough money for two months’ worth of salary for them as it looks like we could be closed for at least that long,” Liss wrote in an email. But while workers wait for payouts from such funds, a few are taking matters into their own hands. On the Baltimore Area Restaurant Industry Relief Group on Facebook, members share tips on how to make the most of carryout and ask for help with filing unemployment. Some offer donations of food and money. Publicist David Seel, whose Blue Fork Marketing group works primarily with restaurants, started the group to connect laid-off workers with resources. He’s also hoping to raise money for laid-off workers. “This is not about food,” Seel said. "It’s about cultural community, and these are our community gathering places.” Seel also started an online petition — now with more than 12,000 signatures — addressed to Hogan and requesting things like a rent freeze and emergency SNAP benefits for workers. Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Last week, former bartender Abby Hopper created a “virtual tip jar,” for servers and bartenders to share their Venmo and PayPal accounts with restaurant goers who want to make donations. Modeled after a similar initiative in Washington, the Google spreadsheet list now contains around 1,800 names. More than a third of respondents said they lacked health insurance. After the shutdown, said Hopper, a Highlandtown resident who works for a wine distributor, said “I just was immediately struck by how many people are going to be in trouble.” While she expects more help to arrive from government assistance and private funds, “We can’t wait three or four weeks for a fund to spread out among Baltimore industry.” Bartender Kate Ewald said she’s received donations from regulars of up to $50 as well as a few dollars from total strangers. "It really does add up,” said Ewald, who until last week worked at Dutch Courage, a gin bar in Old Goucher. “I’m incredibly grateful for that.” Along with the rest of the staff, she was laid off following the restaurant shutdown. While Ewald has applied for unemployment and other financial assistance, she knows it will likely be awhile until that comes through, particularly with the influx of applications. The support from such donations makes a big difference while she’s waiting. “When you’re worried about paying rent or paying your bills, every drop in the bucket counts," Ewald said. Other servers and bartenders have begun doing online courses, or even livestreaming DJ sets to help pay the bills. The pandemic closed the bar where Dagm Endalkachew worked and cancelled all his upcoming gigs as a DJ through May. So last Tuesday, the 25-year-old bartender, DJ and EDM producer set up a camera and began livestreaming himself performing a set. Headphones on, he bobbed his head to the beat of the music, adjusting knobs with the focus of an air traffic controller. Hundreds of people tuned in, leaving comments of support. “This is what I needed," wrote one. Some posted song requests. One suggested he post his Venmo handle, to allow viewers to leave a tip. After a few hours, he signed off on the idea. Before heading to sleep that night, Endalkachew checked his phone. He expected maybe to see a $20 donation from a friend. The total was nearly $100.

Mostly Main: Staying busy at home in a time of coronavirus
.W
Everything is canceled. The end. No, wait! April Fools’ Day is over. Yes, we can’t go anywhere but there are still things to do to continue to be a community. Email, Facebook, Instagram and FaceTime go a long way to mitigate the sense of isolation while we wait this thing out. Every day online, I see evidence of people reaching out to help each other. Everyone can make a difference — just staying home is a kindness to your neighborhood right now. I checked in with a few of my friends and neighbors to see how they were managing. It seems a lot like “Little House on the Prairie” with all of the cooking, sewing and cleaning going on. Everyone is reading, but not claiming much television time. Jackie Troppman reports that she and her husband, Roy, are playing pool at home (they have a great pool table setup in their living room) and she is also reading, scrapbooking and enjoying FaceTime with her grandchildren. Lynda Kouroupis is stepping up her exercise routine, putting together jigsaw puzzles and working on some sewing projects. Tressa Williams is helping out her elderly mother a couple of days a week. At home, she is doing a lot of cooking, working down the inventory in her freezer. Claudia Willey is transcribing 200 letters her father wrote to her mother during World War II. She plans to print them out and give a copy to each of her siblings. Her husband, Ralph, is restoring a classic car. Vickie Goeller, who lives in the historic district, gave blood last week; there is a shortage so if you can, please donate. Vickie is a great amateur photographer as well. She was planning on visiting Whipp’s Cemetery on St. John’s Lane to photograph the flowers. Whipps Garden Cemetery had to cancel its Daffodil Days celebration, but the blooms are beautiful this year and the cemetery is a lovely place to walk. Another great place to walk is the Howard County Conservancy on Route 99. Its programming is suspended, but the grounds are open for experiencing nature. Also, its website has some great programs for kids to do at home right now, and they promise to add more weekly. I checked it out and it offers scavenger hunts, animal yoga, flower dissection and nature weaving among others. Remember when celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse used to talk about “smellivision” on the Food Network? I thought of that when chef Michel Tersiguel started posting photographs of the meals he has been fixing for his family while home. I am sure they smelled and tasted as good as they looked. Taking further advantage of time at home, Tersiguel is also offering French lessons to his two sons. Some people who work from home all the time are Martha Clark and her daughter Nora Crist, who are readying their Clark’s Elioak Farm for opening in the near future. They use down time to paint and repair farm and Enchanted Forest exhibits, plant crops in their extensive greenhouses and open their store on weekends to sell their home grown meats. Call for hours of operation before heading out. They can be reached at 410-730-4049. My husband, Tom, has embarked on a whole house inventory. He started this a few weeks ago but has more time to devote to it now. He is also gardening, reading and making the occasional carryout food run to help support our favorite restaurants. I have been doing a lot of reading, cooking and taking online cooking classes. Several websites have suspended their fees for classes for the immediate future. I have enjoyed a class on the instant pot and am planning to take one on vegetarian cooking next. My 3-year-old grandson Henry, aka Superman, has built a fortress of solitude out of a table and blankets in his living room. I’d like a turn in that. Our friends at Historic Ellicott City Inc. have announced that there will be no show house this year. This announcement came before the shutdown, mostly because of the lack of historic home inventory in Howard County and the increasing difficulty in finding volunteers to man the project. I congratulate them on their amazing record of 33 beautiful renovations that generated revenue for the organization’s mission of restoration, education and preservation, especially in the historic district.

Man charged with violating coronavirus order by hosting party for teenagers at Carroll County hotel
.W
A 26-year-old Lutherville man who allegedly hosted a party of 10 teenage guests at a Carroll County hotel was served a criminal summons Monday. Ryan M. Serra was charged by Maryland State Police with violating the governor’s executive order and 10 counts of allowing a minor to possess alcohol. Serra was charged on a criminal summons, which was served on him by state police at his home just before 2 p.m. The maximum penalty for violating the executive order is one year in jail and/or a fine of up to $5,000. According to a news release from state police, the agency received a report of a party at the Boston Inn in Westminster just after 7 p.m. Sunday. The caller indicated the party involved individuals under the legal drinking age. Troopers knocked on the door of the room and announced their presence, according to the release, and Serra answered the door and spoke to police. Ten juveniles aged 15 to 17, six male and four female, “came out of the bathroom area of the hotel room where they had apparently been attempting to hide. An empty liquor bottle was observed in the room,” according to the release. Troopers allege through investigation that Serra purchased alcohol for the juveniles knowing they were under the legal drinking age. No one in the room appeared to be intoxicated. Troopers contacted the parents of the juveniles and they were released into their parents custody. After consulting with the Carroll County State’s Attorney’s Office, police applied for charges against the suspect with the District Court Commissioner’s Office. In the course of criminal summons, a person is not placed under arrest and processed. Therefore, a booking photo is not taken. Charges were not filed against any of the juveniles. “As part of the state’s effort to combat the COVID-19 virus, Maryland State Police will continue to enforce the Governor’s Executive Order which requires non-essential businesses to close, assembly of only ten persons or less and, as of today, staying at home unless travel is essential,” according to the release.

TV news needs to show us the suffering from coronavirus at ground zero inside hospitals | COMMENTARY
.W
Sounds of coughing and moaning throughout the room. Corridors overflowing with gurneys bearing COVID-19 patients, some in postures of distress. Sheets of plastic taped to walls, makeshift borders aimed at protection and some semblance of privacy. This is what ground zero looks like in the war on COVID-19, according to a CNN report that aired Monday. I believe we need to see more of these images from media outlets of the horrible truth shown here. We have been hearing for the last two weeks about how trauma centers in cities like New York have been under siege as the COVID-19 toll has climbed. Cable and network TV brought us voices of medical workers who were going into battle day and night risking their lives. Their accounts of life and death at the front were often chilling and heartbreaking. God bless the workers for telling us what they could about the reality of the pandemic. But we on the other side of the screen have mostly been hearing how bad it was, not seeing it. The core journalistic admonition of showing rather than telling was not generally being followed. And in this sorry era of spin when citizens are being told by the president of the United States what a great job the federal government is doing in combating the disease, we need to see what that really looks at the point where life can end and death begin for victims of COVID-19. “Every corridor, every corner, every ward, every inch of Brookdale Medical Center in Brooklyn now inundated with those suffering from COVID-19,” CNN’s Miguel Marquez says in a voice-over at the opening of his report, as the camera surveys the misery described above. Standing in a corridor outside the trauma center, Mr. Marquez interviews Dr. Arabia Mollette, an emergency room physician. Both are wearing protective gear. “What I see on a daily basis is pain, despair, suffering and health care disparities," Dr. Mollette says. “What do you need right now?” Mr. Marquez asks. “We need prayers. We need support. We need gowns. We need gloves. We need masks. We need more vents (ventilators). We need more medical space. We need psycho-social support as well,” Dr. Mollette says. “It’s not easy coming in here when you know what you’re getting ready to face.” As Mr. Marquez tells viewers of another death that occurred during the filming of the report, the camera shows a gurney with a covered corpse being wheeled to the state-provided semi-trailer parked in the rear of the hospital that serves as a temporary morgue. There are large ethical and legal considerations when reporting and filming such hospital scenes. Patient privacy and respect must always be at the forefront of journalistic thinking when doing so. Medical institutions must privilege patient rights in deciding about access. In a deadly crisis like this, the ethical considerations are similar to those in coverage of war zones. Do you show horribly wounded victims? If you don’t, how do civilians know the price of going to war? I have taught media ethics for 20 years at Goucher College, and I believe CNN behaved responsibly in this report. Faces of all patients were pixelated, and medical workers were wearing masks or other protective gear that would make it very hard to identify anyone except those talking to Mr. Marquez. I first saw this CNN report Monday morning, and thought maybe I would write about it. Perhaps seeing it would help some of the more reckless among us follow stay-at-home directives like the ones Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday. Then Monday afternoon, I saw President Trump’s press conference, and I knew I had to write about it. There stood Mr. Trump telling reporters what a terrific job his administration was doing in getting personal protective gear to hospitals ― so successful he would soon be shipping medical equipment to other countries. Asked about reports of medical supply shortages in New York City, Mr. Trump repeated his totally unsubstantiated claim that the equipment his administration was sending might be “going out the back door," meaning hospital workers were stealing it. Troubling as the CNN report was to watch, I am glad I got the chance to see and hear with my own eyes and ears what life is like at Brookdale Medical Center. Such images and words are one of the strongest antidotes journalism can deliver to Rose Garden lies. We need more, more, more to fight that contagion. David Zurawik is The Sun’s media critic.

Ramped-up testing in Maryland likely to reveal far more coronavirus cases as Hogan focuses on slowing outbreak
.W
Johns Hopkins Hospital has begun testing for coronavirus in its labs, which could significantly increase the number of people tested in Maryland, the institution said Friday as officials around the state announced seven new cases bringing the total infected to 19. The addition of Hopkins, which developed its own test, and other private labs, will bolster the testing done at the state lab in East Baltimore, which had conducted about 100 tests as of Wednesday but no longer reports how many tests it conducts. The news of additional testing capability comes on a day when Gov. Larry Hogan said on MSNBC that the state had “moved on from testing, quite frankly, to other things right now." Hogan, who has declared a state of emergency in Maryland, said the state was focusing on measures such as closing schools and limiting public gatherings to mitigate the outbreak, as well as treating the sick. "Rather than talk about what they didn’t do and why the hospitals aren’t ready, why the tests aren’t ready, I just want to say what can we do right now,” said the Republican governor, who has sought millions of dollars for the state’s response. Nonetheless, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health said the state is working to increase testing availability and will expand testing as supplies become available. “At this time, testing is appropriate for those who are at highest risk for developing severe COVID-19 disease,” said Charles Gischlar, a department spokesman. “Not everyone needs a test, but everyone can adapt recommended practices such as good hand washing and social distancing to reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19.” Hopkins officials said they expect to increase testing capacity from about 30 a day now to about 1,000 in coming weeks, which will enable public health officials to control the spread of the virus by quarantining those affected and help them understand where it’s headed. It’s only testing samples collected on those with symptoms at its hospitals. “We want to tell people they are infected because we want them to stay home and provide information on people they may have exposed and put those patients in quarantine," said Dr. Karen C. Carroll, Johns Hopkins’ director of the division medical microbiology and professor of pathology. "If we can do this more quickly, we can interrupt the spread. This worked well in China and Korea.” Since widespread testing has been delayed, and largely limited to people who have traveled or come in contact with someone infected, there are surely more cases in the community that have gone undetected. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath and about 80 percent of cases are mild. The easily-transmittable illness, which has spread rapidly into every continent, has sickened at least 136,000 and killed more than 5,000 people worldwide as of Friday. “Without widespread testing, we have no idea the extent of community spread of COVID-19,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner and a professor at George Washington University. “There may be dozens or hundreds of people in the Baltimore region who have the novel coronavirus and don’t know it,” she said. “Testing is key to understanding the degree of the outbreak and guiding the public health strategy for reducing the spread of the disease.” President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday and said a million more tests might be made available within a week and millions more within a month. His administration has been criticized for the slow rollout of testing, as the number of cases climbs and the response alters everyday life for every American. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced this week that it has approved three other private labs to conduct tests across the United States: LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics and Roche. Quest said in a statement that it expects to be able to perform tens of thousands of tests a week within the next six weeks across the country. LabCorp said in a statement that it could perform several thousand tests per day and is rapidly adding new equipment and staff to create additional capacity. None of the private labs allow people to walk in and have a test because of the infectious nature of the coronavirus. They all require a doctor to order a test at a hospital or clinic capable of safely swabbing patients. Public health officials say the tests will help control the virus. “A lot more diagnostic testing will help us understand where we are,” said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There has been limited diagnostic testing capability, but that’s going to change in the next week or two or three.” He emphasized that the process of collecting the sample was important to keep health care workers and other patients from becoming infected. Health departments are outlining a process where they direct a patient to a specific place where they are met by workers who are prepared with protective gear and an isolated space to swab someone’s nose and throat. Hospitals also are asking people who believe they may have been infected not to come to the emergency room, but call their local doctor or health department for instructions and screening per guidelines approved by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To ease the threat of cross-contamination in emergency room triage centers, some Maryland hospitals have set up drive-up collection sites for patients suspected of having the contagious upper respiratory disease. Others have set up triage tents outside. LifeBridge Health, a hospital network that owns Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Northwest Hospital, Carroll Hospital, Levindale and Grace Medical Center, said it plans two drive-up specimen collection centers. Carroll Hospital launched its testing site on the third floor of its parking garage Wednesday and Sinai Hospital expects to have its drive-up site operational by Monday, said Leslie Simmons, executive vice president at LifeBridge Health. The drive-up testing sites allow patients to remain inside their vehicles. They’re handed a swab and swipe their nose and throats with the windows closed before handing the sample back to hospital personnel. With coronavirus believed to spread via direct contact with people and surfaces exposed to the virus, drive-through testing centers can perhaps slow the person-to-person passage of the disease. University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, a University of Maryland Medical System affiliate, also began drive-up specimen collection Friday in its emergency room parking lot. No other UMMS affiliates had rolled out similar testing sites. Tests, however, remain limited, and many people who suspect they are showing symptoms have been turned away if they do not meet specific criteria set by the CDC and state health department. Simmons did not say how many tests have been run at Carroll Hospital so far, or if any had come back as COVID-19 positive. Carroll County announced its first case Friday. But she did say that if a person did drive up to the mobile site and asked to get tested in the car without a referral, they would be turned away. “We have to be concerned we’re following CDC’s algorithm so we use supplies judiciously so we are not randomly testing but focusing on those most at risk,” she said. LifeBridge said it was using the CDC’s test for now but was considering the possibility of using another type of kit, such as one developed by Hopkins. Mercy Medical Center and Greater Baltimore Medical Center also said they are working on plans to swab patients outside of their facilities. Even as hospitals gear up for a surge in patients seeking care for the coronavirus and dealing with other medical issues, many healthcare professionals, researchers and staffers said they could fall far short of handling the outbreak, especially since medical systems have a finite number of intensive care beds, ventilators, protective gear, doctors and nurses on hand.

‘I am not taking it very well’: Carroll County spring sports athletes, coaches react to cancellations due to coronavirus
.W
Westminster’s girls lacrosse team was en route to a scrimmage at Garrison Forest on March 12 when the Owls received news that schools were closing the following day for two weeks due to the coronavirus threat. Spring sports were slated to begin Friday, March 20, with 21 public-school events on the first play date. Karen Salmon, the Maryland Superintendent of Schools, announced last week that schools will remained closed through April 24 in a news conference led by Gov. Larry Hogan. This announcement comes after their initial March 12 decision to close Maryland’s public schools from March 16-27, but the date was pushed back an additional four weeks due to a statewide increase in confirmed coronavirus cases. “We used that scrimmage as our opening day and we took eight freshmen and junior varsity players with us to go down, 30 kids,” Owls first-year coach John Brown said. “We got them all playing time and it was a great time to go down there and play, but we were a little sad walking off the field knowing we couldn’t practice together the next day. “We have tough kids and they’re competitors who like to win. This group is really tight and they’re sad they can’t see each other.” Brown said the team communicates with one another through TeamApp, a platform that allows teams and social groups to improve communication by creating their own smartphone app. The girls upload photos and workouts in the chat thread to stay engaged, and Brown arranged a senior spotlight for the team’s social media platforms to recognize Westminster’s eight seniors. “It tied in with them missing game day and not knowing if they were going to get to play one game,” Brown said. “The seniors have been waiting for opening day and we decided to highlight four on one day and four on another to give an introduction to the season while still hoping that we will get to play a little bit." Those seniors — Skylar Miles, Katie Pettine, Faith Chmielewski, Deryn Schoenfelder, Madison Mills, Sophie Fischer, Chloe Sedlar, and Hope Michael — were asked to answer five questions and send in a picture of themselves dressed in their Owls uniforms for each highlight. Brown replaced Jackie Stevens as Westminster’s coach after serving as assistant for two years. Stevens left following last season, her 10th, after leading the Owls to back-to-back state championships in 2018 and 2019. “The goals don’t change,” Brown said. “Jackie did a great job setting the culture for this program and the kids show up every day, work hard, they keep their mouths closed and they compete. We had some great leaders that we lost last year and other are stepping into those shoes. The expectation is to go out, compete in every game and be really good come May.” Other athletes across the county are doing whatever they can to keep busy despite the cancellations and a spring season on hold. Century junior midfielder Demma Hall said she tries to maintain a steady workout schedule while trying to keep a lacrosse stick in her hand every day. “I am not taking it very well. It’s actually so ... depressing,” Hall said. “It’s hard to wrap my head around that this is actually happening. And it is for a lot of people.” Manchester Valley senior Brett DeWees missed his freshman baseball season due to an injury and said he didn’t want to go out without the chance to play another game. “High school is different,” DeWees said. “Travel ball, you play a lot of tournaments, a lot of showcases, so it’s like … the games don’t really matter because you just play a round-robin with college coaches there. But with high school, you’re playing to win. You’re playing with the guys you grew up with. “So, that’s the sucky part. I don’t want to … miss that season.” Pat Stoetzer contributed to this article.

Orioles’ prep cut off as MLB cancels spring training games, delays start of season amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
The Orioles’ spring training preparations will be cut short as Major League Baseball canceled spring training games, effective at 4 p.m. Thursday, and is delaying the start of the regular season for at least two weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a league announcement. “MLB and the clubs have been preparing a variety of contingency plans regarding the 2020 regular season schedule,” the league said in a statement. “MLB will announce the effects on the schedule at an appropriate time, and will remain flexible as events warrant, with the hope of resuming normal operations as soon as possible. “Nothing is more important to us than the healthy and safety of our players, employees, and fans.” MLB said that teams will be instructed on what to do with workouts and daily operations in the coming days, with World Baseball Classic qualifying games canceled in the interim. In response to MLB’s announcement, the Orioles released a statement supporting the decision. “The health and safety of our players, fans, staff, and partners will always be our top priority," the statement said. “We will communicate additional details, including information about refunds, directly to fans when they become available, as this is a rapidly-evolving situation.” Minor League Baseball also announced that they were delaying the start of their season. Orioles first baseman Chris Davis, who is the team’s representative to the Major League Baseball Players Association, said he was “pretty shocked," and said that the rapid succession of measures taken to protect fans, athletes, and those around all of the other major sports was “a lot to take in." “I think there are so many questions that I have, and I know a bunch of guys have approached me with questions that I just don’t have answers to,” Davis said. “I think really in the next couple of days, hopefully we can get a little more clarity. Right now, it almost doesn’t seem real.” Davis said his own personal preference was to stay at the team’s spring training complex in Sarasota, Florida, but that players were in a “holding pattern” as to whether they’d be sent home, asked to stay at team facilities to prepare for the season there, or be left to choose themselves. “I think there’s some frustration with just how much is up in the air, really,” Davis said. “We just don’t really know what’s going to happen, but looking ahead, knowing now that the season’s going to be pushed back at least — at least two weeks — it just changes a lot of things for us. Guys with families, guys with plans to move out, or start packing up. It’s just going to change a lot of things. But obviously, it’s for the best of everybody involved. It’s just a weird situation, to be honest with you.” Davis was one of many players who were caught up in the day’s confusion, even as the NBA’s decision to suspend its season Wednesday night and a full day of reporting on MLB’s plans to possibly suspend spring training made the outcome inevitable. Without any word from the league, the Orioles had no real choice but to go on with their day as scheduled Thursday. In the late morning, presumptive major league rotation members Alex Cobb and Tommy Milone pitched simulated games to teammates DJ Stewart, Ryan Mountcastle, Chance Sisco and Renato Núñez on the back fields behind Ed Smith Stadium. With nothing from Major League Baseball stopping them and a 90-minute drive to play the Minnesota Twins ahead of them before a scheduled evening game Thursday, the Orioles’ traveling party boarded their buses and left the facility, only to return and empty the buses back into the clubhouse. Davis was one of a handful of players who was going to drive himself to the game in Fort Myers, Florida, and was already on the highway before he got word to return. All the while, the Orioles who weren’t scheduled to play in the game went right from a 12:30 p.m. team meeting to the practice fields, where they were playing catch and warming up as the buses pulled back in. Executive vice president Mike Elias made a radio appearance on 105.7 The Fan at 2:15 p.m. as the teams waited for updates. At the time, Elias said season preparations and roster decisions were "a secondary concern right now to public safety and figuring out what and how is the best way to go forward. “At some point, we’ll be back to business as usual,” Elias said. “But I think these are the measures that are taken so that this doesn’t get much worse than it has to be.” Elias, asked about what it would mean for the team’s preparations for the season, said in the radio interview that it was “so much to process." “I’m starting to think about it, and this all happened so fast," Elias said. "Assuming there is some type of interruption to the spring training schedule, we’re going to have to figure that out, and I think it’s going to depend on whatever details we have about what the regular season is going to look like in terms of how players should prepare. We’re definitely, once we hear something, if we do, we’re definitely going to pour a lot of thought and work into that. I’m sure there will be some suggestions and cooperation between the different sports teams. We just haven’t gotten the details yet, so it’s hard to really plan.” The league’s action comes after they shut down access to clubhouses to non-essential personnel including the media, instituting a 6-foot buffer space for interactions and cutting off fan access for on-field interactions and autographs. The Orioles were scheduled to host the New York Yankees on March 26 at 3:05 p.m. for Opening Day, and then the Boston Red Sox before making their first road trip with visits to the St. Louis Cardinals and the Yankees. In addition to spring training games, the Orioles’ exhibition game against the New York Mets on March 24 at the Naval Academy in Annapolis has been canceled. The Orioles also announced that season plan members will be automatically refunded for game tickets and parking purchased for remaining games at Ed Smith Stadium, and fans who purchased tickets through Ticketmaster, Orioles.com, StubHub, or at the Ed Smith Stadium box office will automatically receive a refund to the credit card that was originally used for purchase.

Baltimore club banger urges listeners to wear face masks during coronavirus pandemic
.W
A new song and video draws on the signature sound of Baltimore club music to encourage that people wear face masks as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. The track, called “Put Your Mask On (Baltimore),” samples the late Baltimore club music icon Miss Tony’s song “How U Wanna Carry It." Its heavy beat loops around the titular hook and calls out geographic locales like Cherry Hill and Liberty Heights. The accompanying video features three girls performing a dance routine that incorporates the crazy legs moves native to Baltimore club, as well as footage of people around the city practicing safety and wearing face masks. As of Wednesday morning, the views counter on YouTube says the 92-second video was seen over 15,000 times since its Friday debut. Credit for “Put Your Mask On” goes to the family operation behind Be More Open, a hyperlocal media company that local residential developer and writer Eli Kelley launched in December. Kelley, who co-produced the video with his music producer son Ezekiel Kelley, said he was inspired to write the song after seeing people congregating near a treatment facility in Old Goucher, close to a place that he said is known for open-air drug sales. “This was Thursday, and they were close to each other, some had masks on and some didn’t,” the elder Kelley said. Thinking about how they should all don masks, lest they pass something on to family back at their homes, led to him repeating “Put your mask on” like the hook on the Miss Tony (also known as Big Tony) song. Inspired, Kelley went to his son Ezekiel, who hosts Be More Open’s “Just Talking” interview program, and asked him to create a song about it. The pair workshopped different versions over the course of a day before coming to the one featured in the video. The elder Kelley added that his son came up with the idea to involve another of Kelley’s children, 13-year-old Nahyah Pack, and ask her to choreograph the dance routine. Pack is in the center of the dance sequence, flanked by Chloe McLeod and Bri’Asha Aldridge — both of whom, like Pack, dance at Pack’s mother Darby Pack’s Maryland Academy of Dance in Owings Mills. Nahyah Pack said that she has been dancing in the Baltimore club style for years, having studied with local dance luminary TSU Terry. Dance sequences were shot in Owings Mills, while the scenes of people wearing masks were shot in Downtown Baltimore and other city neighborhoods. “Put Your Mask On (Baltimore)" went from idea to published video in barely a day. Since its publication, “Put Your Mask On (Baltimore)" has put its creators on a bigger platform than before. Ezekiel Kelley said that people have approached him asking for the track, as well as encouraging him to do other Baltimore club mixes. “Before this, I didn’t necessarily consider myself a Baltimore club producer...getting the reaction of people enjoying it, and it resonating with people and making people want to dance and share it, has been great for the city,” the younger Kelley said. As fun as it is, Eli Kelley said that this track is ultimately borne of caution. “This is a way that we’re expressing our concern, as opposed to someone, a bureaucrat that [people] are used to seeing on television telling them, ‘Hey, you should do this now,'" he said. “I think we’re embracing that hey, we have to encourage each other — and in a light way, as light as we possibly can, given the circumstances."

Annapolis native Christian Siriano of Project Runway lends support in New York City to combat coronavirus
.W
Designer Christian Siriano knew he wanted to pitch in to the call for help from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Hearing there was a shortage of materials such as gloves and face masks for medical personnel, he immediately stepped up. Siriano and his team made 100 face masks for hospital workers after learning of a shortage from Cuomo’s social media. "If we need masks my team can make them!" Siriano wrote on Instagram. "I have sewers and pattern makers ready to help working from home we just need all the information on how to help.” Siriano, an Annapolis native who now lives in New York City, later explained: “The Governor gave us the go ahead and the info.” The masks, made of a poly fabric, will help hospital workers from receptionists to social workers. The masks are not for doctors, he added. Siriano said that he could actually make the masks for doctors, but at the time only masks for other employees were requested. “We plan to make 1,000 or more if we can,” he wrote in a message to The Baltimore Sun. “A few days we will be able to really make a difference.” On Friday, Cuomo tweeted his appreciation for Siriano’s efforts. "Appreciate his help so much," Cuomo wrote. "Who's next? Let's do this together, NY!" Later that day, additional designers took to social media and also pledged to join in the effort and produce masks. Siriano, who is known for his connection to “Project Runway” (he currently works as a mentor on the show) and for his ability and willingness to dress women of all shades, sizes and shapes, said he has been doing his best under the current conditions. On Friday, Cuomo ordered all nonessential employees to work from home. “We are all at home trying to stay inside,” Siriano wrote, adding that his mother still resides in Annapolis, where he grew up. “My mom does yard work to keep her exercise because she is 75 and needs to be home.”

14 people charged with violating Maryland’s stay-at-home order during coronavirus pandemic
.W
Baltimore Police have charged a 19-year-old woman with violating Gov. Larry Hogan’s executive order requiring residents to stay home, writing that an officer believed she was outside a vacant East Baltimore home only to sell drugs. At least 14 people have been charged with violations of the governor’s executive order, and charges are pending in about one dozen other cases, a Maryland State Police spokesman said Tuesday. Police in Maryland have responded to 1,064 calls for complaints related to potential violations since March 24. They’ve also performed 14,900 compliance checks to ensure businesses are following the orders. Baltimore Police said officers warned Danasia Campbell twice about the executive order that requires residents to stay home except for "absolutely necessary” reasons, such as grocery shopping or going to work. Officers decided to issue a criminal citation after she was spotted outside a vacant home in in the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello neighborhood three times. A criminal citation typically calls for a suspect to appear in court at a future date, and does not result in arrest. There is no indication in the police report that Campbell was taken into custody. Police said in an incident report that Campbell was stopped outside vacant homes in the 1600 block of Gorsuch Ave. on Friday and Saturday nights and given warnings each time. On Monday, when an officer again spotted her sitting outside a vacant homem a criminal citation was issued. The officer wrote in the report that Campbell, who lives on Chinquapin Parkway in North Baltimore, does not live in the neighborhood and “has not been in this area for any essential reasons.” It continues, “Due to this Officer’s knowledge of the area and previous interactions and arrest of Ms. Campbell it is believed… by this officer that Ms. Campbell is only in this area to sell drugs.” Campbell could face one year in jail and a $5,000 fine. She did not have an attorney listed in online court records. Previously, state police said Ryan M. Serra, of Lutherville, was charged last month with violating the governor’s executive order, along with 10 counts of allowing a minor to possess alcohol. Police said he hosted a party of underage teens at a Westminster motel where officers found open liquor bottle. Police in Charles County charged Shawn Marshall Myers, of Hughesville, after police responded to Myers’ home for a large gathering. In both cases, police said the men violated the order by hosting gatherings larger than ten people. Baltimore Police have instructed officers to issue criminal citations after repeated attempts to have individuals comply. Officers can then pursue criminal charges but only after consulting a lieutenant or above to determine if charges are appropriate. Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton contributed to this article.

‘I’m afraid it’s going to walk its evil head through that door’: Harford assisted living nurses on frontline of coronavirus pandemic
.W
Nurse Karen Briggeman has been on the frontlines of two wars — one human, the other viral. But the fight against the new coronavirus is nothing like what she, or other Harford County assisted living nurses, have experienced before. “I never thought I would see this in my lifetime, really,” said Briggeman, who served in the U.S. Army for more than two decades, including in the Gulf War. Working as a wellness nurse at Brightview Bel Air — an assisted living community — Briggeman said things have changed. In the years before the pandemic, she and others started on their tasks as soon as they came into work, administering medication, changing dressings and socializing with the residents, who were free to visit with their families, eat in the dining room, get their hair cut and live a normal life. Now, Briggeman said, staff submit to temperature checks and a questionnaire screening for COVID-19 before starting their shifts. Residents are quarantined to their rooms and tended to by nurses in facemasks and gloves. Meals are delivered to their rooms in Styrofoam containers; the dining room is off-limits. Their families cannot visit. There is nothing typical about it. But more taxing than the mechanical changes are the emotional ones, Briggeman said. Brightview is home to a dementia unit, housing 25 residents, she said. Explaining the pandemic to them, and other residents, is the hardest — especially so, given their families’ forced distance from them, though the approach has helped the center avoid any confirmed coronavirus cases thus far. “Especially now during this time, the residents are socially isolated from each other and their families," she said. "We are their family now more so than ever.” Briggeman became a nurse in 1989, getting her degree through the Army’s nursing program. During the Gulf War, she trained nurses who had been called to active duty from their Army Reserve and National Guard units to fill in for deployed forces, Briggeman said. She was motivated to become a nurse after seeing them in action. She spent a good deal of time in the hospital for an illness in the 1980s and saw the compassion that the other nurses had for patients, deciding it was the life for her. With decades of nursing experience under her belt, she understands, now more than ever, residents need that human touch. It is clear, she said, that some residents are lonely — separated from family, friends and their daily routine. So she and the other nurses at Brightview try to make their days in sequestration more entertaining. They take residents out on walks, she said, brought a musician to entertain the confined seniors, who opened their windows to hear the music from the center’s courtyard and even organized a socially distant car parade of family members for them. Briggeman effuses about the residents she cares for. She knows the resident whose favorite band is the Carpenters; or the resident who wants her newspaper as soon as she wakes up. She knows what they like, dislike, need and want. But when they ask the critical question “when will this all be over?” she cannot answer with certainty. Though the steps the center has taken are for the best, Briggeman gets to go home and see her family every day. Those she cares for do not, a fact that runs through her mind and cracks through her amiable tone. "It’s emotionally taxing [for nurses] because we see how it’s emotionally taxing them,” she said in a breaking voice. “We do the best we can to let them know that they are safe.” The stress mounts between concerns for her residents and her own family, Briggeman said. She worries about tracking the virus into her own home. And she worries about the havoc it could cause for the residents she has cared for and grown close to. “I am scared every day that somewhere, even though we are compliant with going to work and coming right home… I don’t know who the other people live with and what they’re doing,” she said. “Yes, I am afraid, one day, it is going to walk its evil head through that door.” Across the street from Brightview Bel Air, JoAnn Driver worries about the same thing. As soon as she enters the building, like other staff, she has her temperature checked. As a registered nurse at Brightview Avondell, she is forced to see patients through a face shield and protective gear. “Every day you are worried,” she said. “We have been diligent here, but every day we worry.” Avondell, like Brightview, has quarantined residents in their rooms, which is hard for them, Driver said, physically and mentally. The center has a socially distant exercise program, but residents are still showing a decline in mobility. "We are working very hard to try to get that exercise in from them,” she said. Back at Brightview Bel Air, the same problem occurs, but residents seem to be suffering from acute loneliness, absent their families, resident nurse Claire Bilski said. Some are not eating, she said, and others are feeling poorly from the lack of contact. The center tries to get each resident into a routine, making sure they see the same people very day and setting a schedule to keep them active and socializing. The dining room is key to that plan, Bilski said; without it, some residents are not eating. It also puts strain on her, as instead of seeing all the residents gathered in one place she has to make the rounds to each individual room to take their temperature and check on them. “I have to see every single resident in the building, take their temperature, ask them how they are feeling,” she said. “That takes a toll. That takes quite a bit of time.” Bilski, like the other nurses and attendants who staff the centers, have to carry on their duties with the threat of the novel coronavirus in the back of their minds. Bilski said that, if they were to find the virus as one of the centers, there would be only one explanation for its appearance. "It would be us bringing it into them, that is the thing,” Bilski said. Though ties are uncertain, the three said, nursing is a passion — something the three were made to do. Personal concerns melt away at work in view of residents’ needs. It is something, they said, that cannot be taught. "I have always felt like the patient or the resident is your priority is your concern — it is not about you, it is about them.” Bilski said. "It is something that you just do, even though you have these risks … because you want to make sure this person comes out OK.” “I couldn’t say that I never worry about it,” Driver added, "but it would never have me second guess my career. I am glad I am here for them.” "We’re on the frontlines too, just in a different capacity,” Briggeman said. "This is what I was meant to do in life.”

‘We gotta stay home, and we gotta stay strong’: Maryland athletes, coaches help Hogan urge fans to follow coronavirus warnings
.W
For fans missing their favorite teams while in quarantine at home, some of Maryland’s most iconic sports figures have provided encouraging messages. Ravens coach John Harbaugh, legendary Maryland men’s basketball coach Gary Williams, Ravens Hall of Famer Ray Lewis and Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky have recorded videos urging Marylanders to stay home to help combat the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and thanking those on the front lines of the crisis in the medical field. “We are in it together," Harbaugh said in his video. “Let’s win it together.” The videos are part of a coordinated messaging strategy — along with Gov. Larry Hogan’s recent daily local and national media appearances — to get all Marylanders to grasp the seriousness of the situation and remind them “we’re all in this together,” said deputy communications director Kata Hall, who has been soliciting the videos and posting them to the governor’s Twitter account. “He’s trying to get that message across to as many people as possible,” Hall said in a phone interview. “We’re using the voices Marylanders trust to get that message across." Hogan’s recent media blitz has included appearances on WPOC, a country radio station, and The Junkies, a sports radio program on WJFK, in addition to more traditional local and national news outlets, noted Michael Ricci, Hogan’s top spokesman. “The goal here is to reach as broad an audience as possible and reach people where they are,” Ricci said. People seek out trusted sources of information in any trying and uncertain time, and sports stars and other celebrities are “people Marylanders identify with, who they’ve known over the years,” he said. “It helps to have it amplified by people who aren’t politicians,” Ricci said. Harbaugh, whom the governor’s staff contacted through a team official, was the first person they asked, and he sent back a video within 24 hours, Hall said. Harbaugh coached the Ravens to victory in Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013 and led them to a franchise-best 14-2 regular season in 2019. He said in his video that the state has “an outstanding game plan” to fight the virus. “Number one, stay home; that’s how we slow this opponent down,” Harbaugh said. “Number two, stay calm. We can’t win with panic. Number three, stay engaged. There are so many plays that we can make: Give blood, donate to our food bank, be a hero in our neighborhood. Number four, let’s take care of our families. Let’s engage with one another. Let’s spend time together. Maybe get some things done around the house that we’ve been putting off for a while. “We are a team," he said. “We want to win this thing.” Hogan’s staff hadn’t planned to produce a whole video series, but when they saw the response to Harbaugh’s clip on social media, they wanted to keep it going, Hall said. On a whim, Hall reached out to Gary Williams, the retired University of Maryland coach, through a mutual acquaintance: her dentist. Williams, who led the Terps to the 2001-02 national title 18 years ago this week and retired in 2011 after 22 seasons, recorded a message and sent it back the same night, Hall said. “I’ve joined a new team: the state of Maryland’s team against the coronavirus,” Williams said in his video. “Anyone can join our team. To be a good team, you have to be fundamentally sound. Among our fundamentals are staying at home, washing our hands as often as possible, making sure if we do go out we stay 6 feet away from anyone we might run into, making sure we listen to any [directions] from Gov. Hogan’s office, and if you get the chance, make sure you help someone that might be unemployed or lacking food. “We live in a great state and a great country. Please be a member of our team as we fight against the coronavirus, and we will have a decisive victory. Thank you, and please stay safe.” Although the 2020 Olympic Games have been postponed a year, Ledecky, a Bethesda native and Olympic gold medalist, is still finding ways to make an impact. Ricci got her to record a video from California, where she is living, encouraging her home state to support the medical professionals fighting the virus. “I know I’ve always really appreciated it when you’ve cheered me on in my swimming career, and so today, together, I want us to all really cheer on the doctors, nurses, health care workers and all the medical professionals on the front lines fighting this virus,” Ledecky said. “To properly cheer them on, we all need to do our part," the swimmer said. "We need to stay home, really hunker down. We need to stay safe, wash your hands, use hand sanitizer, don’t touch your face. We need to stay aware. Let’s listen to Gov. Hogan and all of the medical professionals telling us what to do and not do. And we need to stay calm. Let’s support one another during these times, but from afar.” Lewis, who spent his entire Pro Football Hall of Fame career in Baltimore, was the latest to back Hogan’s stay-at-home message. “I want to say thank you to all the first responders and the health care workers for all of your selfless work that you are doing on the front line,” Lewis said. “You are truly the backbone to this society. “We really need to do our part, any way that we can help, and I think the way that we can help is we gotta stay home, and we gotta stay strong.” Hogan, a Republican, appeared in a fifth video himself Friday, acknowledging the challenges facing Marylanders — a record 84,000 of whom filed for unemployment last week. “I know how difficult this is on each and every one of you," the governor said in the video. "There’s a great deal of fear and anxiety, and the truth is that none of us really know how bad this is going to get or how long it’s going to last. But I can promise you there are a great many dedicated people doing tremendous things, working around the clock, and doing their very best to help keep Marylanders safe. “In the days to come, we’re going to need to depend on each other, to look out for one another and to take care of each other, because we are all in this together, and we will get through this together.” Hogan’s aides were tight-lipped about who might appear next on the governor’s Twitter account, although they acknowledged that they have reached out to the Orioles and at least one well-known Maryland band. They say they’re open to more suggestions, if you have them. “It’s been amazing," Hall said. “Everybody’s stepped up and said yes.”

Del. McComas: Leadership should’ve suspended legislative session sooner amid coronavirus crisis
.W
Long ago, it was written “No man’s life, liberty, or property are safe while the legislature is in session.” In these COVID-19 times, no legislator is safe. On Tuesday, the maximum number of individuals to gather was 10. The legislature is a group of 141 in the House and 47 in the Senate. It is impossible to stay six feet away from each other seated and voting from our small desks. Even though the Capitol was closed to the public, lobbyists and tourists, neither the legislators nor skeletal staff was quarantined to ensure the invisible, contagious, spreading virus has not entered the inner sanctum of lawmaking. To make things worse, the incubation period for the virus can take a week before symptoms show up. People can pass the virus without any symptoms. There was no testing of the assembly; so none, one, or all of the legislators might be carriers. No one knows. The virus can last three days on surfaces and three hours in the air. Gov. Larry Hogan decided to end the session three weeks early. Because I am in the high-risk category, I made the difficult decision to forego the last two days of session after having a candid conversation with a medical provider. I believe that the leadership should have suspended session earlier and returned when this crisis abated. The Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate control everything — bills that pass or die in committee, selection of committee chairs and vice chairs, chamber agendas, office assignments, furniture, letterheads and use of the franking privilege. The leadership made the decision to soldier on without the necessary assurance that no one is carrying the virus. We had a number of staff that continued working in order to keep the assembly passing bills — the janitorial staff, bill, mail, and print rooms. I cannot over-emphasize that this session has been challenging. The freshmen have figured out the system and flooded the committees with bills that ban plastic bags, pesticides, guns, and privacy for police personnel files. The chambers can be hyper-partisan when it comes to gun control, taxes, environmental regulations, law and order, and educational choice. The most powerful lobbying groups are the Maryland State Teachers Association, the Maryland Trial Lawyers, and the environmental advocates. They have funded the Majority Party for decades in Annapolis. Police are viewed with suspicion and distrust. This mindset limits the ability to pass rigorous public safety initiatives. There has been a concerted effort to dismiss Gov. Hogan’s legislation and implement the Majority Party’s agenda. The Majority Party is famous for “shadow bills” that take the governor’s ideas and make it their own. So much for bipartisan cooperation. The Sexual Predator Statute of Limitations HB 794 passed the House unanimously but has not received a hearing or vote in the Senate. I received a lot of emails opposing HB231/SB530 regarding the source of funds for Section 8 rentals. I voted against it. The House and Senate bills were both passed in each chamber and now go to the governor for his signature or veto. The good news is both Houses passed SB669/HB1095 to establish a Maryland Prescription Drug Affordability Board to study the cost of drugs and make them more affordable to state and local government and present a plan to the Assembly to lower drug costs. I received many emails requesting me to vote against the $47 billion state budget. Constituents were adamantly opposed to passage of the budget due to funds for abortion clinics. I supported budget amendments that deleted any funds for abortion, but the amendments died due to the overwhelming power of the majority party. Although Planned Parenthood has significant contributions by foundations and donors, they still lobby and receive money from state and federal coffers. I hope that all of my constituents in Legislative District 34B are staying safe in these ever strange and shifting times. Due to all of the chaos, I am going to change the scholarship deadline to May 1, 2020. Please forward your applications to: Delegate Susan K. McComas, Room 323, Lowe House Office Building, Annapolis, Maryland 21401. The application is on my website www.smccomas.com and then look under local issues for the application and instructions. Susan McComas is a Republican member of the House of Delegates representing District 34B.

Senators Van Hollen and Cardin urge Gov. Hogan to take decisive action as 136 coronavirus cases hit Maryland prisons
.W
As the number of cases of coronavirus in the state prison system jumped to 136, the state’s Congressional delegation joined together to urge Gov. Larry Hogan to take swift action to corral what they called the “rapidly spreading outbreak." The new figures, updated Wednesday evening, represent a nearly 50% increase from numbers reported by the state Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services just two days earlier. “In light of recent reports that an inmate has died of complications due to COVID-19, we urge you to take aggressive actions to stop the further spread of this virus amongst the state’s prison population, the delegation, led by U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, wrote in an open letter to Hogan. While the letter praises the state’s effort to improve hygiene in the prison system, it notes that the increasing numbers and the first reported death earlier this week show more needs to be done. “We urge you to strongly consider the recommendations of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh that you exercise your commutation power by working with the Maryland Parole Commission to identify and accelerate the release of inmates who pose little risk to public safety," the letter read. They added that in addition to slowing the spread among inmates, the action would "not only protect correctional officers, first responders, and inmates, but also our state at large.” A total of 72 correctional officers and 31 inmates have been reported as having the virus. The other confirmed cases include contract workers and staff not working directly inside correctional facilities, according to department spokesperson Mark Vernarelli. The Jessup Correctional Institution has the most cases with 40, and an inmate at the facility died from the virus, the state reported Monday. That same day the state reported a total of 93 cases systemwide. At Jessup, 13 inmates, 16 officers and 11 contract employees have contracted COVID-19. Following complaints from inmates in other prisons, Patrick Moran, Council 3 president of AFSCME, which represents some prison employees, also called Thursday for Hogan to provide correctional officers with N95 masks as opposed to the personal protective equipment that has been made inmates in the facilities. The masks made by the inmates are made out of a polyester-type material, which Moran called “inadequate.” “They are sneeze guards, not masks. They are asking people to use these over and over again,” Moran said. “If Governor Hogan has a mask to walk around the empty convention center, then I would think that he could provide proper masks to the people doing the work and in the trenches every day." The letter from the state’s congressional delegation represents their strongest effort to slow the spread inside Maryland’s prison. Besides Van Hollen and Cardin, U.S. Representatives Jamie Raskin, Steny Hoyer, John Sarbanes, Anthony Brown, David Trone, and C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger signed on to the letter. “The only proven method of slowing the spread of COVID-19 to date, social distancing, faces significant hurdles where populations are concentrated, such as correctional facilities,” the letter said. “It is with this recognition that the Department of Justice and governors across the country have begun to reduce the size of prison populations.” This comes just a day after a federal judge ordered the emergency release of Derrick Boone, a Baltimore inmate awaiting trial.

'The most hopeless feeling’: After 12 days on a cruise ship, passengers return to Baltimore facing uncertainty amid coronavirus pandemic
.W
When the Royal Caribbean Grandeur of the Seas left the Cruise Maryland port terminal nearly two weeks ago, only three people in the state were confirmed to have tested positive for the new coronavirus, and it still seemed like a faraway problem to passengers Lisa and Dave Thoma. “Things were kind of ‘wash your hands,’ and that was about it,” Lisa Thoma said Thursday. As the ship sailed south, however, the roughly 2,000 passengers learned they would not be allowed to get off as planned in most of their sandy destinations — Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis — due to new restrictions. Instead, the Grandeur made port calls in Barbados and Dominica, passengers said. They watched the news from aboard the ship as the pandemic began to spread more widely in the United States, prompting Maryland public schools to close for at least two weeks and Gov. Larry Hogan to announce a host of other emergency measures to contain the outbreak — including the closure of the state-owned cruise terminal they embarked from. The governor’s order allowed the Grandeur to return to Baltimore. But, passengers wondered, what they would find when they arrived? “When you’re sitting out in the ocean and watching and hearing about the hoarding and the situation, it is the most hopeless feeling you’ve ever had in your whole entire life," said Lisa Thoma, 55, of Blacksburg, Virginia. Thoma said she and her husband hesitated a little before boarding the ship, especially because she has type 1 diabetes and would be considered a high risk if she is exposed to COVID-19. But they had looked forward to the cruise for more than a year and decided they didn’t want fear "to stop us from living,” she said. Passengers were on high-alert, though, and the sound of a routine sneeze or cough aboard the ship was enough to turn heads, she said. The retired couple and others disembarking Thursday morning in Baltimore heaped praise on the Royal Caribbean crew. Crew members face their own significant uncertainty about how the global pandemic — which has included at least one cruise-ship outbreak and has caused officials to halt cruises in many areas — will affect their jobs and their families. A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. “It was probably one of the scariest times, but we will also tell you Royal Caribbean and Captain Patrick and his crew members were phenomenal,” Thoma said. “They went way beyond. They had smiles on their faces. They were trying to do everything in their power to make sure this is the best cruise they could.” While passengers were not required to remain six feet apart, as recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thoma said, crew members were constantly cleaning, and when passengers were prohibited from serving themselves at the buffets as a health precaution, crew members served them instead. “This has been a cruise we will never forget, but they really did the best they could in times like this," she said. Nancy Beswick, who lives in Massachusetts, said the crew took such good care of her and her husband, Jeffrey, “that we had a fantastic cruise.” The couple, who are in their 50s, felt safer on the Grandeur than anywhere else they could have been, she said. “I felt like we were in really good hands,” Beswick said. “The cruise ship had a protocol in place for emergencies. They went into high gear and took care of us, and they were putting our health as a priority.” Passengers were not subjected to a health screening when they arrived in Baltimore, she said, adding the crew made getting off the ship quick and easy. All passengers had their temperatures taken before boarding, and the cleaning procedures aboard the Grandeur were the most pronounced that Jeff Davidson said he had seen on any of his three dozen other cruises. The crew kept passengers updated on sanitization efforts, which included cleaning all handrails every 30 minutes, said Davidson, 69, an on-board speaker dubbed “The Work-Life Balance Expert" and gives speeches on ways to reduce stress, get better sleep and increase longevity, among other topics. “They were cleaning doorknobs, sills, baseboards, anything anybody might touch,” he said. “They took so many steps that after a couple days ... people’s concerns really just dissipated. They became more concerned about what’s going on back home.” The Carnival Pride, the other cruise ship that calls the port of Baltimore home, dropped off its last passengers and left Baltimore Wednesday for Miami. The cruise line is offering its ships to the government as temporary, floating, 1,000-room hospitals to treat non-COVID-19 cases and free up capacity for hospitals expected to be overwhelmed by the outbreak, Carnival announced Thursday. Twelve days at sea taught the Grandeur’s passengers a lesson in how quickly the coronavirus is moving — and just how much can change in two weeks. While Maryland had just three cases when they left, the state had 107 total confirmed COVID-19 cases Thursday, including the first known infection of a child, up from 85 on Wednesday, when the state had its first coronavirus death. With most roads and highways clear due to so many people working from home or not working, the taxi from the cruise terminal to BWI Marshall Airport was the fastest Davidson ever experienced, he said. When he arrived at Baltimore/Washington International, he was one of the only passengers in the airport, which Hogan closed Thursday to all non-passengers, and made it through a security checkpoint in about 90 seconds, he said. He was one of two passengers on a Delta flight to Raleigh, North Carolina. The plane had arrived empty from Philadelphia, he added. “There’s nobody in the airport,” Davidson said. That’s not the only difference they face. Grocery stores have been struggling to keep food, cleaning products, toiletries and hand sanitizer on shelves as people rush to buy rations. As cruise passengers head home, they’re not sure what they’ll find. “Now we’re heading back to Blacksburg,” Lisa Thoma said, “and we’re gonna see if we can’t get some toilet paper.”

‘Bacchanalia of buffoonery’? Harsh words, but reopening businesses before coronavirus is under control fits that description to a 'b' | COMMENTARY
.W
We never expected to find ourselves defending a social media post from Len Foxwell, chief of staff for Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot. After all, we’ve been the subject of them in the past. But calls for his firing from the Maryland Republican Party, after he posted on Facebook last week about people defying coronavirus safety measures, have stirred our concern. Mr. Foxwell has angered quite a few folks, many of them gun-toting, judging from the Wild West memes they’re posting in response to his comments, which GOP Party Chairman Dirk Haire called “extraordinarily inappropriate and representative of a base and destructive mindset.” So what did he say that was so offensive? People who protest over social distancing shutdowns should be lured into a “big, big warehouse (we’ll call it something classy to suit their refined sensibilities, like ‘American MAGA Platinum Palace’),” he wrote online. “Get them in, bar the door and then let Darwin work his magic.” A little survival of the fittest, in other words. We’ll admit, after watching the line of trucks and cars driving around State and Church circles in Annapolis Saturday under the banner of “Reopen Maryland," a similar thought crossed our minds, but not in Mr. Foxwell’s death-match kind of way. Those who defy the stay home orders are already knee-deep in a game of natural selection: Are they among the hearty and smart-enough-to-stay-inside who will survive COVID-19, or are they too “unevolved”? The restrictions that Maryland and most other states have been living with are no fun, we’ll concede that point. They are causing significant hardship. There are business owners facing ruin, and unemployed workers struggling to make ends meet. There are even curious twists of the lockdown, such as how gun shops and firing ranges are considered critical, while mom-and-pop Main Street stores are shuttered. Should the rules be tweaked? A case could be made. But that’s not what the protesters were doing. Their message wasn’t to adjust the lockdown, it was to rescind it entirely. “We are petitioning our governor, Larry Hogan, to immediately reopen our state’s business, educational and religious institutions,” reads the organizers’ online petition. Do they really think rescinding the stay-at-home order now, when health care practitioners don’t have sufficient tests — even with the South Korea influx — to determine who has or has had the virus, when there isn’t enough protective gear, when cases and fatalities continue to climb is a good idea? Do they believe that customers will flock to stores and restaurants or be comfortable sending their kids back to school under these circumstances? We strongly suspect the protesters don’t believe any of that. Why? Because the resolute souls demonstrating in Annapolis stayed in their vehicles, many wearing face coverings, and they generally kept appropriate social distances. In fact, they acted like people who had gotten the message that COVID-19 is a serious disease and that taking proper precautions could spare their lives. Yet their protest expressed exactly the opposite view. In psychology, this is called cognitive dissonance. According to Mr. Foxwell, such actions are “a bacchanalia of buffoonery.” The best we can say about this is that the protestors may well have come by their cognitive dissonance honestly and from no less a personage than President Donald Trump who tweeted Friday: “LIBERATE MINNESOTA," “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and then “LIBERATE VIRGINIA." These were references to similar protests calling on the governors of those states to rescind stay-at-home orders. Note that all three have Democratic governors, and Michigan is regarded as a key swing state in the 2020 election. As unemployment numbers skyrocket, the president is headed toward an “I want the economy back on track, but those governors won’t let me” argument — now that someone has explained to him that U.S. presidents don’t call all the shots. Protests in Annapolis serve his purposes. Lucky for us, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, has expressed little sympathy for the protesters or the president’s pushiness. He understands it’s far too early to talk about rescinding orders. And Comptroller Franchot, who hopes to be the state’s next governor, appears to understand that Maryland voters aren’t much concerned about offending those who are willing to risk the lives of others with their own selfishness. “I remain 100% supportive of Len Foxwell and the exceptional work he continues to do for me and for the people of Maryland,” Mr. Franchot said in a statement. “He is an exceptional public servant, a dear family friend, and I look forward to his continued service as my chief of staff for years to come.” Good for him. We may have our disagreements from time to time, but we can faithfully report that neither man is among the unevolved.

North Carroll: Manchester fire company has put on annual plays for a century, except during world wars — and coronavirus
.W
We have a lot of traditions in the North Carroll area. Many have been in existence for so long that it’s hard for even our oldest community members to say exactly when they first began. As we sit at home today, learning and working from our living rooms, interacting almost instantly with a global world but unable to physically get together with our friends and neighbors due to the present coronavirus concerns, that link to the past becomes even more interesting. Imagining how things were in our community before computers, endless 24/7 cable news coverage or even cars never fails to make me appreciate the sense of community found in our area. I thought it might be fun to share the history behind some of the places and events we might take for granted in today’s North Carroll. One of those events is the annual theater production on the Manchester Volunteer Fire Department’s stage. The stage is in the tall, older building attached to the firehouse on Main Street. Traveling up the stairs, you can imagine stepping back to a simpler time — a time when you couldn’t just turn on the TV or catch $5 Tuesdays each week at the local movies to be entertained. Area residents have been gathering to put on a play in this building each spring for longer than any of the people I’ve talked to can remember. We know that the performances in Manchester have been happening for at least a hundred years now. Volunteer Elwin Wagner writes in an email, “This has been a long standing event for the fire dept dating back to as far as the 1920′s. There are several actors who have been doing this for many years, a few over 30 years. I personally remember coming to the play when I was a kid. I would go to all the performances and would come early in order to get a front row seat.” The plays were discontinued for a few years during wartime — once during the first World War and again during World War II. It must have seemed like a momentous change for children of those eras, just as the current cancellations of events do for youngsters today. One thing that remained constant, though, was that life would return to normal and the play would continue as soon as each threat was over. It will this time, too. This year’s production of Lunatics at Large has been halted, but I’ve been assured that the stage will fill again next year and the play will be presented to enthusiastic audiences, just as a MVFD play has been for over a hundred years now. If you have area history or trivia that you remember, send me a message and I'll do my best to share it with readers in an upcoming column. But wait — who are these “Lunatics,” and why are they at large? I’m glad you asked. Wagner shared the details with me, and it’s time to name names. The play was in the final weeks of rehearsal and lines were getting memorized. Creative juices were flowing to bring in alibis and local humor to the script when everything had to come to a screeching halt due to precautions about COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Elwin relates that, “During the three months of practice we all become family and very close friends. We feed off each other when it comes to interjecting humor. Sometimes we crackup so much that we have to pause to get all the laughter out of our system.  I feel at times we should have audiences come to our practices and see humor at its best. We are all just volunteers and certainly not professional actors. This group works so hard, but we have such a fun time doing the play and I think it shows through when we perform for audiences. In the end this is a fundraiser for the fire dept. and we appreciate the folks who come out and support us.” The play was originally written in 1936 by James Reach as a companion to “One Mad Night,” a mystery comedy that left audiences at the time clamoring for more. “Lunatics at Large” uses many of the same characters and builds on them for even more mystery and comedy that has endured for generations. The setting is the reception hall of the lonely and bleak “old Cutter mansion.” Don Cutter, played by Wagner, is a playwright and the owner of the home. He and his wife Lucille, played by Sandy Mancha Wright, run a home for the mentally ill with the assistance of Dr. Janet Reed, played by Armatha Shower, who is in charge of mental patients. Mysteries start happening when Amos Burke, a business associate of the previous owner of the home who is up to no good, portrayed by Tom Rooney, is released from prison. There are actually two mysteries in this play, though, and lots of laughs. One is a murder whodunit, and the other surrounds a missing black box. Intertwined are the antics of the lunatics living in the mansion. Unexpected guests come out of the blue, causing more chaos. Doug Wheeler has the part of Mr. Hyde, a ferocious villain. The bloodthirsty wench Priscilla is brought to life by Kelly Rhoten. Jeremy Sperlein is fascinated in Native-Americans as John Alden, while Deb Bair is a victim of Shakespeare as Lady MacBeth. Adding to the enjoyment are Angel Collins, the mysterious Mrs. Adair, with Lisa Warner as her “somewhat cracked” daughter Elaine, and Gary Eppley as Greg Stevens, a man in a hurry with his sister Claire, played by Sandy Black. Blake Rhodes has the part of the unseen actor. Kathy Rhodes is the prompter for the play. Jeff Diems handles sound and lighting, and Jason Dubs serves as stagehand. With the able assistance Steve Hossler as Wing, Don’s Chinese valet who is a disciple of Charlie Chan and has a quotation for every occasion, and Steve Miller as police Inspector Britt, who feels he is going crazy himself at times, all the mysteries get solved in the end — or do they? You’ll have to catch one of the actors around town for the inside scoop at this point or wait until next year to find out.

The government shut restaurants down because of coronavirus. Monica Alvarado found a way to keep them serving meals.
.W
When Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan halted all restaurant dine-in meals last month to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, Monica Alvarado wanted to help neighbors and colleagues whose lives had been upended. Alvarado, owner of Annapolis’ Bread and Butter Kitchen, considers philanthropy an integral part of food service. Instead of organizing food drives with non-perishable products bought in bulk from big-box stores or grocers with diminished supplies, she devised a plan with pastor and community organizer Ryan Sirmons to feed the hungry while keeping restaurants open and workers earning paychecks. They call it Feed Anne Arundel. “It’s a lifeline,” Alvarado said by phone recently as she prepared an afternoon snack of bacon for her children. “For a lot of [restaurants], they wouldn’t be able to keep their doors open if they didn’t have this program." Feed Anne Arundel collects money to pay restaurants to cook items from their menus, such as steak and mushroom chili, scallops and lemon risotto and grilled salmon with potatoes and asparagus. Volunteers deliver the food to drop-off sites. So far, meals have been delivered across the county: Kingdom Celebration Church in Odenton; the Bay Ridge Garden Apartments in Annapolis; and Friendship Community Baptist Church. Alvarado hopes to donate as many as 10,000 packaged dishes per week, depending on how much money she can raise. Every $1,000 raised pays for 100 meals and puts 10 people back to work, she said. Still, the money only goes so far. “There’s just not enough food for the demand, and the demand is increasing every day,” she said. “It’s going to come down to funding for us.” Alvarado has raised about $70,000, with more than $35,000 coming from GoFundMe. A Facebook Live concert and raffle raised $6,000. She seeks state and county dollars to supplement those donations. About 30 restaurants have signed on to the initiative, and one owner said it’s prevented some layoffs. “I’m able to bring my kitchen guys in more frequently because I’m making that money,” said Erin Dryden, owner of Luna Blu, an Italian restaurant in Annapolis. “Sales have dropped so drastically. This is keeping me going.” Light House Bistro in Annapolis has taken over managing food deliveries, letting Alvarado focus on fundraising and organizing. The Anne Arundel County Partnership for Children, Youth and Families has helped identify distribution sites. And the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation has taken over managing the funds. “They stepped right up. It was a huge win for us,” she said. “Having someone with that level of experience to manage that — we’re very lucky." The county’s outpouring of support for Feed Anne Arundel has humbled her, Alvarado said. “People are good, they really are,” she said. “It’s a relief to see people smiling again.” Know a hero?

‘Not why I wanted to be here, but I’m here’: Maryland nurses work on coronavirus front lines at New York hospitals
.W
Kelly Alilio had never been to New York. As Alilio, 42, took her first steps in the city, she exuded confidence. She had to — for herself and her worried husband, Alex. Last month, Alilio drove north on the New Jersey Turnpike from her Owings Mills home, alongside Alex. She savored the conversation and laughs, hoping to make them last during the 66-day separation ahead. On April 8, Alilio joined thousands of nurses from across the country to help fight the coronavirus pandemic on the front lines in New York, one of the hardest-hit states in the country. She and two other Baltimore-area nurses, Nancy Holmes and Ricelle Taganas, disrupted their lives and those of their concerned families to help strangers. The three women are working in hospitals just a few miles apart in the city. Knowing the risks, Alilio originally wanted to take a bus to New York. Her husband shut down that idea: If she was going, so was he, at least to drop her off there as she faced the risks of the novel coronavirus. “It meant a lot to him to be able to take me and to see where I was going to be staying, and to help me get settled,” she said. “I put him in a situation without power or control. That was the one thing he could have control over, getting me there safe and getting me settled.” She had quit her job as an on-call nurse at Baltimore’s Mercy Medical Center. She planned to continue online classes for her doctorate of nursing practice and family nurse practitioner degree at the University of Maryland, Baltimore when she had time off in this new city. Once a New Yorker, always a New Yorker In 2001, Nancy Holmes was at her nurses orientation with other recent graduates at St. Vincent’s Hospital in Lower Manhattan when the class heard a boom. “We were in class and someone said there’s been an accident,” the Elkridge resident said. “We were in class when 9/11 happened.” That morning, each newly graduated nurse was assigned a patient on a stretcher as the hospital lobby was transformed into a triage center after the attacks on the World Trade Center. “This is the kind of stuff they tell you in orientation that you don’t pay attention to because you never think it could happen,” Holmes said. “I was extremely scared, nervous, anxious.” Nearly 20 years later, Holmes, 44, returned to New York, with hospitals there in an eerily familiar and distressing stance. “To see New York recover from [9/11] was very humbling,” she said, crying. “When [the coronavirus pandemic] happened, I had to come. I don’t know, I felt like I had to.” Holmes quit her job at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore and by April 13 she was back in orientation, this time at Staten Island University Hospital preparing to take care of her first COVID-19 patients. Answering the call Ricelle Taganas normally lets phone calls go to voicemail, but when she saw her squad leader calling after 11 on a Tuesday night, she was intrigued and concerned, so she answered. “She laid it straight to me and asked, ‘Would you be ready?’ ” Taganas, 24, recalled. Taganas, a Perry Hall resident, is an Army reservist finishing her bachelor’s in nursing at Notre Dame of Maryland University, just weeks from graduating. In the less-than-two-minute phone call, her world changed. “[I] got off the phone and my heart just started beating out of my chest and I started shaking,” she said. “I knew I could calm myself down in a matter of seconds, but it was such an out-of-body experience for me at that moment that I couldn’t actually physically calm down. Mentally I was OK, but physically I felt all these nerves.” Taganas didn’t tell her family that night. The next morning, she said the words aloud to her sister Gabbi and parents Melissa and Carlos, for the first time: “I’m leaving.” “They were appalled. They didn’t know what to do,” she said. “It was a tough conversation to have.” Taganas had to be ready to go with little notice. She had her bags packed, checked her phone incessantly and mapped each day’s plans around her inevitable departure. She knew the drive to her unit at Fort George G. Meade would take her 45 minutes. “If I had to go, I could throw my hair up and get ready in a moment’s notice,” she said. By April 7, Taganas was in New York, ready to work at the Javits Center, the convention center that had been turned into makeshift hospital in Manhattan. It had been nearly a year since she had been in the Big Apple for — of all reasons — a nursing conference. The first shift “It was worse than what I expected,” Alilio said. There were nearly 30 ventilators in the emergency room keeping patients alive on April 10, Alilio’s first day. Stretchers with patients on oxygen lined the hallways as tubes draped the floor to extend the oxygen from patients’ rooms to those in the corridors. Plastic, opaque sheets were temporary doors to keep negative pressure in patients’ rooms. “Those first couple shifts, it was like not real life. I felt like I was in a movie,” she said. “The amount of people in the ER was overwhelming. It was a little surreal.” Brooklyn has more than 47,000 confirmed cases and approximately 4,000 deaths. It’s one of the harder-hit areas of New York states, which has more than 320,000 cases and more than 19,000 deaths as of Tuesday, according to the New York Department of Health. Alilio saw and felt the reality of those numbers up close. Fifteen minutes away across The Narrows strait that separates Brooklyn and Staten Island, Holmes walked to her first day of work on April 15. Her mind flooded with memories. In the early 2000s, she lived across the street from Staten Island University Hospital, where she now worked. She was reminded of the old New York, a New York that was lively and loud, with no trace of coronavirus in sight. “I didn’t really know what to expect because I didn’t know anyone else who was [at Staten Island University Hospital],” Holmes said. “I was following the news closely, not able to pull myself away from it. I based [my expectations] on what I had seen on TV.” At Staten Island University Hospital, she began experiencing a hectic new world. “My first day they tried to give me four patients,” Holmes said. “There is no way you can take care of four vented ICU patients.” A typical patient-to-ICU-nurse ratio is 2-to-1, according to Holmes. She had cared for three vented patients every day since her first shift. “As an ICU nurse, I’m not afraid of death. I’m comfortable with people dying, but a large quantity in a short time, it’s hard,” she said. In Lower Manhattan, for her first shift the evening of April 10, Taganas walked the three blocks from her hotel to the Javits Center. It was still light outside, but as New Yorkers settled in for the evening, she was just getting started. Taganas would soon learn to navigate the center, which had been transformed into a vast expanse of hospital pods. She was assigned to the recovery area. The Javits Center has a decent stock of personal protective equipment, she said. She calls her patients “walkie talkies,” those who can walk and perform to the best of their abilities. Some need oxygen tanks to go to the bathroom or a wheelchair because they can’t walk far. Taganas is there to help. Feeling very ‘lucky’ With some hospitals experiencing shortages of personal protective equipment, Holmes, Alilio and Taganas all described their situations as “lucky.” However, each illustrated a different version of luck. Holmes brought gloves and masks from home for her shifts because she didn’t know what to expect and she didn’t want to be caught off guard; she ended up not using them. “We are allowed to have one N95 [respirator mask] per day, which is good,” she said. However, Holmes struggles beneath her mask. With each hour that passes on her 12-hour shift, her face gets hotter and hotter. “These masks are not designed to be worn all day,” Holmes said. “It’s suffocating.” At the Javits Center, there are stands stocked with “a good supply of PPE,” according to Taganas. She shows up for her shifts in her Army uniform. Each nurse there is issued scrubs, an N95 mask, a gown, a surgical mask to put over the N95, gloves, eye shields, boot covers and optional head caps. Taganas and other nurses at the center have been storing their N95 masks in labeled paper bags to reuse every five days. “I’ve never taken care of an airborne or droplet patient before this,” Taganas said. “Every day I’m nervous I, myself, could get sick.” When it all clicked Holmes realized quickly she was living the life she had watched so closely on TV. The constant overhead codes indicating emergencies and patients in distress rang throughout her shift, just as the nurses on TV told her they would. “It’s overwhelming emotionally,” she said. For Alilio, the constant overhead codes were just the tip of the iceberg. She recalled the time a doctor had to drill a hole in a patient’s head to drain fluid. There was no operating room to use, so it had to be done in the ER. “That was a ‘holy crap’ moment,” she said. Each day Alilio walks by three trucks parked outside her Brooklyn hospital. She knows now that the trucks are a makeshift morgue brought in out of necessity. She recalled another moment when an alert popped up in the corner of the hospital’s computer systems: A usually empty corner of the screen was now occupied with the word “disaster.” The irony wasn’t lost on her, she said, of using the word “disaster” in a disaster zone. “Every COVID patient that I have taken care of has died,” Alilio said. A little hope Taganas takes comfort in being surrounded by her “second family.” Though she’s alone in her Manhattan hotel room, she relishes every chance to spend time with her fellow Army nurses. “It only feels normal to me because I’m surrounded by friends and people that I know,” Taganas said. “I can’t imagine being a travel nurse or a civilian nurse who signed a contract to be away from their families with people that they don’t know and going to a place like the Javits ... and having to work with complete strangers.” Outside the Javits Center, when she’s not doing her schoolwork, Taganas runs along the Hudson River. Exercise for her is self care; she runs the stairs in the hotel from the fifth floor to the 29th and back down again. She’ll likely still be working at the Javits Center when she graduates May 17. There will be no formal celebration for now, just busy nights helping those who need it. “Listening to these people’s stories and how they got to the hospital and who they are outside of the hospital, that reminds me why I am so in love with the profession of nursing,” she said. “A lot of the work that I’ve done wasn’t even trying to fix anything. It was more so being that person that they get to talk to because they probably haven’t seen their family in weeks. While I was tasked with caring for patients, it was more of being that shoulder to cry on, that person to talk to at night to kind of ease their anxieties.” At the end of a long shift, Holmes opens the door to her place in Staten Island, drops her bags and turns on the TV. She re-watches a day like she just lived. She uses the FaceTime app to see and talk to her daughter, Hailey, who’s staying with family in Connecticut. “It’s hard being away from your family and your kid. [I know] she’s taken care of and I don’t have to worry about that,” Holmes said. By June 7, they’ll be reunited. For Alilio, the day after Easter was a tipping point at her Brooklyn hospital. The number of patients decreased and the pace slowed. The coronavirus still surrounds her, but it’s less consuming. “I think a lot of the people who had been [at the hospital] had passed away. It made room,” she said somberly. “We’re in a place where we’re seeing the impact of social distancing.” Alilio spends days off sleeping and thinking of the New York outside her window, the one she hasn’t yet met. She uses FaceTime to read her 3-year-old son a bedtime story over the phone sometimes, too. She’s fielded all kinds of first-time New York suggestions from friends and family, Central Park and Coney Island among them. She’s quickly approaching her May 30 end date, and as the hospital shifts get slightly less exhausting, her schoolwork lessens and the weather clears up, she’s closer and closer to seeing the Big Apple. “I’ve always wanted to go [to New York] and here I am," she said. "Not why I wanted to be here, but I’m here.”

Baltimore-area college coaches trying to be creative in communicating with athletes restricted to home by coronavirus pandemic 
.W
A year ago, Greg Ey’s day would have been filled with attending classes, eating meals with friends, and working out at practices as a member of the Towson men’s lacrosse program. But fears about the spread of the coronavirus pandemic forced the NCAA on March 12 to cancel all Division I spring sports, and many colleges and universities sent their students home and closed their campuses. That meant many of the student-athletes have had to train on their own. Fortunately for Ey and his teammates, they have access to an app purchased by the Tigers that offers daily workout sessions to stay in shape and continue to build on what they accomplished when they were back on campus and under the careful monitoring of their strength and conditioning coaches. “This resource has been awesome,” said Ey, a junior midfielder who hails from Baltimore and graduated from Boys’ Latin. “I get my schoolwork done in the morning, and then I have some free time. I just hop onto the app, go into the garage, turn on some tunes, and just get after it. It’s been great emotionally, physically to put everything into that workout.” As many states have ordered their residents to stay home and closed non-essential businesses in an attempt to slow the COVID-19 outbreak, spring sport coaches have had to be more creative in communicating with their athletes. Technological features such as video-conferencing platforms like Zoom and Google Meet and face-to-face visual calls like FaceTime have become the options du jour for coaches and players separated by miles and time zones. “This is our new reality,” Navy women’s lacrosse coach Cindy Timchal said. One objective for many coaches is ensuring their players are continuing to work out, and Towson’s TeamBuildr app is perhaps the most innovative. Aaron Droege, the university’s assistant athletic director for sports performance, and his staff upload daily regimens specifically designed for certain sports’ athletes, who can then access the app and work out. Droege said videos demonstrating exercises are included, and players with questions can contact the strength and conditioning coaches for more information. Athletes seeking to finish a full session must complete one section and tap “Completed” on their phone before the app will take them to the next section. “The kids were using it, and we were asking for feedback, and they said, ‘This is awesome,’” Droege said, adding that the university purchased the app in August and debuted it in time for the start of the spring sports. “They can do everything right there in the safety of their homes.” Droege acknowledged that there were some questions about the app’s viability when it was initially introduced. “It’s really been a blessing in disguise,” he said. “It was something very new to a lot of us as strength coaches because we’re used to Excel templates that we’ve kind of made for ourselves and are comfortable with. There were some hiccups at first, but I couldn’t imagine making all of those Excel templates and copying them to PDFs and sending them out now. This has been really easy to streamline the workouts for everybody.” Amy Horst, the Loyola Maryland women’s track and field coach, has organized meetings via Zoom and FaceTime to share with her athletes charts and graphs of data cultivated from earlier tests they had finished. They have used the numbers to outline workouts and build on that data. “I never thought as a coach that I would become dependent to be able to communicate with my athletes on FaceTime, but we’re using that like crazy,” she said. “It’s very different just to be able to talk to someone and see her face when we know these athletes so well and have spent so much time with them. … It’s more of an individualized approach than we would normally do.” Chris Kuhlmeyer, the UMBC softball coach, has set up one-on-one virtual calls with each of his players for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. His greater goal is arranging for “virtual lessons” in which he either can watch a player practice and provide feedback or review a video recorded by the player and send back his input. “We’re just trying to come up with some creative things to continue to just communicate,” he said. “We’re trying to do what we can to keep this thing rolling and keep them motivated.” Many coaches said they are not fretting about their athletes staying shape because many of them are self motivators who enjoy sweating. The larger concern is the lack of personal interaction that coaches used to sense if their players were emotionally or mentally distracted. Timchal, the Navy coach, has used Zoom to talk to her players, but she can’t assess the type of body language that can tip her off to a player’s mindset. “You’re always concerned for your team about the mental-health state,” said Timchal, who has divided her roster with her three assistant coaches so they can personally call each athlete and rotate the players so that the coaches hear a different voice each time. … This is something that no one has ever experienced. Younger athletes are probably wondering, ‘What’s going on here?’ So it is difficult, and it’s difficult for everyone.” Added UMBC baseball coach Liam Bowen: “We spend a lot of time in our coaches meetings asking, ‘Hey, how do you think so-and-so is doing?’ and a lot of that is just read from being around them at practice. So even with all of the tools that we have, I think that piece of it is going to be really hard to replicate. I don’t think you can do that over Google Meet.” Until the coronavirus pandemic is turned back, the coaches understand they will have to be more inventive in communicating with their athletes. Kuhlmeyer, the UMBC softball coach, said he has never appreciated technology more than now. “Sometimes I gripe about it, but at least from a technology standpoint, we have these computers in our hands to be handle this kind of time,” he said. “We can communicate with them so much easier, and it’s more on their level, too.”

‘We won’t ever know’: Maryland women’s basketball left to process the end of a brilliant season because of coronavirus pandemic
.W
Blair Watson said she loved everyone in the room. Kaila Charles said she would not want to conclude her four years at the University of Maryland with any other group of people. The air hung thick with emotion Thursday as the Maryland women’s basketball team confronted the end of a deeply promising season, cut off by an unexpected opponent — the surging coronavirus pandemic. Terps players and coach Brenda Frese knew bad news was probably coming. They had guessed as much when the NBA suspended its season and the cancellations of college tournaments began piling up on Thursday morning. Still, they gathered for practice at the Xfinity Center on Thursday afternoon, hoping to stay sharp and keep a wonderful run going a little while longer. But then Frese saw deputy athletic director Colleen Sorem walking down the arena stairs, and she knew time had run out. Sorem told her the NCAA was about to cancel March Madness because of the coronavirus pandemic. And Frese was left to gather her team in a nearby lounge to process an odyssey that would never have a proper ending. The Terps had come so far, winning 17 straight games after a Jan. 9 loss at Iowa dropped them to a disappointing 11-4. They had rolled through the Big Ten tournament, winning every game by at least 12 points, and were almost certain to hear their name called as a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Now they knew that announcement, scheduled for Monday, would never come. The four seniors on the team — Charles, Watson, Stephanie Jones and Sara Vujacic — would never pull on Maryland uniforms again. After startling second-round upsets had ended their previous two seasons, players felt confident they would craft a better conclusion this time around. But they’d never have a chance to prove it. Frese tried to find silver linings during a conference call with reporters Friday morning. At least her players had watched confetti fall as they celebrated their Big Ten championship in Indianapolis last weekend. A team that had discovered its collective fire over the course of a bumpy season got to finish with a rousing victory. Even if it wasn’t the one they had all dreamed of. Sadness mixed with pride as everyone on the team spoke in that lounge Thursday. “I think it was a mix of both,” Frese said. “Obviously, the sadness that you’re not going to be able to continue on but also being able to remind this team of our ending. We’ll be one of the very few teams to end with a win and confetti coming down. We’re one of the few fortunate ones that got one incredible week. … For us, I think we probably had better closure than a lot of people out there.” Frese expressed no bitterness about the cancellation of the tournament and said her players also understood the larger stakes for a world that’s been thrown into uncertainty by coronavirus. “It’s bigger than sports,” she said. As players expressed their feelings on social media Thursday, they celebrated the unity they’d achieved but lamented opportunities lost. “I feel robbed,” Charles wrote on Twitter, accompanying her words with tear and broken-heart emojis. “Family forever,” she wrote in a subsequent post accompanying a team photo. The news was most difficult for the four seniors, who left a legacy worthy of Frese’s previous great classes, even if they never led Maryland back to the Final Four. Charles is an All-American who will go down as one of the best all-around players in program history. Jones built on the legacy left by her big sister, Brionna, and the Havre de Grace native became a consistent force in her own right. Watson became the team’s defensive ace after working back from a knee injury that cut off her potentially brilliant sophomore season. Vujacic, a guard from Slovenia, did not play as much as the others but delivered ebullient energy when she did. “Our hearts go out to the seniors,” Frese said. “I think that’s the biggest thing, them not getting this opportunity back and thinking about where they led us, the heights of this season. So not knowing the ending for them I think is obviously pretty sad.” Many observers have speculated that the NCAA might allow seniors in spring sports to play in 2021 after their 2020 seasons were canceled because of the pandemic. Frese said she would support such a move but said the basketball season was probably too far along for such a policy to benefit her program. “Although I’d take it,” she said, laughing. “For all four seniors to come back.” Frese has guided three teams to the Final Four and one to a national championship, so she knows what it takes. As she spends the next few weeks at home with her family, unable to hit the road for recruiting because of state travel restrictions, she’ll live with the knowledge that this team carried such potential. She watched them grow into a close group led by the players as much as the coaches. Their cohesion reminded her of the 2005-2006 team that went all the way. “They really were on quite a mission,” she said. “There’s always the what-ifs, and I think this group was probably going to have an opportunity to hang another banner in Xfinity. … We won’t ever know.”

Camden Yards concession contractors call on Orioles to help those out of work during MLB’s coronavirus shutdown
.W
On a day when they typically would have been hawking hot dogs or pouring drinks to a sold-out, Opening Day crowd at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the food service workers who are contracted to work at the stadium instead were calling for help. Unite Here Local 7 represents food service workers including about 700 Delaware North concessions employees who are contracted through that company for the Orioles’ home dates. The Baltimore-based union held a virtual media conference Thursday morning calling for the team to step in to ensure payment to those who Delaware North laid off when the season was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. “A week and a half ago, we all heard MLB was contributing $1 million per team to be available to pay stadium workers, but that money has not been committed to our members, who are the ones who cook, who serve the beer, who help serve the customers,” Unite Here 7 president Roxie Herbekian said. “I’m calling on the Angelos family as well as the Orioles organization and Delaware North to help compensate us the money we were counting on during this difficult time” said Nnameke Onejeme, the chief shop steward and a lead stand attendant at Oriole Park. “We know that Major League Baseball has made that money available. We’d like to use that money to care for our families during this crisis.” The union sent a letter to managing partner Peter G. Angelos dated March 23 asking for the team to step in and join the growing list of owners who have ensured the part-time employees who staff their stadiums will still be paid. “We ask that the Orioles make the same commitment,” the letter signed by Herbekian said. “Though the concession workers are not employed by the Orioles or Camden Yards directly, they have worked hard through the years to make Orioles’ games a success. The contracted concession workers at Camden Yards are loyal workers and loyal fans.” The Orioles referred comment to Delaware North, whose spokeswoman sent along a Wednesday announcement that the company was laying off two-thirds of its full-time staff and no longer scheduling part-time staff. Herbekian said that they had not received a response from either side as of Thursday morning. That the union workers are employees of Delaware North and not the Orioles is complicated. While the Orioles haven’t announced plans to use the $1 million allocated by MLB for each team’s seasonal employees during the shutdown, that money is set aside for that purpose. With the Orioles offices closed through at least April 13, full-time and part-time employees of the team and the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network are still being paid through that time period. But even in the most recent example of games missed in Baltimore — the 2015 unrest surrounding the death of Freddie Gray in police custody — there was a distinction in who paid workers. The Orioles paid their own game day employees for scheduled games that didn’t go off as planned, and Delaware North paid the concession workers. With Delaware North’s mass layoffs, the union is turning to the Orioles for help. Herbekian said the union’s experience has typically been that Angelos and his son, executive vice president John Angelos, “have been sensitive to the needs of our members.” She cited the Freddie Gray situation as an example. “In other instances when we’ve gone to Mr. Angelos and the team with concerns, they’ve been extremely responsive,” Herbekian said. “It’s our hope that the team will continue in that same vein and we can figure out a way that we can get resources to the men and women who work in the stadium and their families during this very difficult time.” In the interim, Onejeme said he and many of the stadium contractors are on unemployment. Some use it to bridge the offseason gap in normal circumstances; others are part of the record waves registering for those benefits because of the coronavirus shutdown. He’s been working at Oriole Park at Camden Yards for 10 seasons, he said, and as a lead stand attendant who serves and does inventory on his stand each day, made $12.50 per hour last year. At stands, tips supplement that less than $100 per game, he said. George Hancock, 34, is also a stand attendant with nine years experience and said the workers “just want them to do right by us, just the same way we come in every day and do right by them.” “I put a lot of energy, time, my personality in this job. Everybody at the stadium, a lot of them know me,” Hancock said. “I just want them to do right by us just like we’ve been doing right by them. We’ve been committed workers, coming to work, smile. Even when we don’t feel well, we still go in and do what we need to do.” Charlotte Chatel, 62, started at Memorial Stadium and is now a suite attendant at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. She said unemployment benefits are eaten away by medicine she needs after a kidney transplant, and she and her husband are digging into savings to cover the difference. All three union members said the stadium work is something that can help get them through the entire year, and they’re not alone. “People are using their emergency resources to just get basic stuff like water, food, even to go to the store and get Lysol is a big thing now,” Hancock said. “It didn’t used to be that way. We’re using our emergency funds, stuff that we’d usually pay our insurance with, extra little stuff like for some people gas and bus fare, we’re using all of our resources just to get by right now.”

Carroll County commissioners delay tax sale, approve grant program for small businesses hurt amid coronavirus
.W
Carroll County’s commissioners voted this week to approve postponing the annual tax sale and creating a grant program for small businesses to ease the financial hardship some have experienced as the coronavirus has forced much economic activity to a halt. Carroll County residents with unpaid tax accounts as of April 1 will be mailed “second notice” bills, but penalties will be frozen as of March 31, a county news release states. Interest will continue to accrue monthly on past-due property taxes. With five thumbs up, the board voted Tuesday after Commissioner Stephen Wantz, R-District 1, raised the subject. He expressed concern over the people facing financial crisis during the pandemic of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. “People are in tough shape and it’s going to get tougher,” he said. That doesn’t mean people will be able to avoid paying taxes, though. By freezing penalties, the county could lose “tens of thousands” of dollars, county Comptroller Robert Burk estimated, but taxes will still be due. He said the loss will not be significant to the budget. Meeting via live video conference, the commissioners unanimously voted “aye” to postpone the tax sale by giving a thumbs up. Wantz had argued the commissioners should vote to help the group of about 2,000 residents who had yet to pay tax bills — just as the board voted separately to help local businesses. Earlier in the same meeting, the commissioners unanimously voted to offer grants to small businesses in the county. The county’s Department of Economic Development and Burk discovered an unused small business loan fund of more than $800,000 within its budget and offered it as a way to help businesses. “We just took a major step to help our small business folks without a whole lot of debate,” Wantz said. “I love small business, but I also love my citizens.” Jack Lyburn, county director of economic development, suggested developing a one-page application for businesses and awarding up to $2,000 per applicant. Commissioner Ed Rothstein, R-District 5, who had urged the county to look into assisting small businesses the week prior, on Tuesday suggested offering grants between $1,000 and $1,500. Lyburn requested the board settle on one number. The commissioners passed grants of up to $1,250 per business. Up to $500,000 of the small business loan fund will be used. The Carroll County Industrial Development Authority will disperse the grants for the county, which will vet applications and provide guidance to the IDA. Carroll County cannot award the money itself because it is a commission form of government. The Department of Economic Development will work with the Carroll County Chamber of Commerce, business associations and municipalities to ensure all small businesses are aware of the opportunity, Rothstein said in an interview. More details about how to apply, eligibility and what the grants can be used for exactly are forthcoming, he said. How to pay taxes Tax payments are accepted online at https://paybill.carrollcountymd.gov, or via U.S. mail or a drop box located at the County Office Building, at 225 N. Center St., Westminster, MD 21157. The drop box is located in lower parking lot "A" across from electric vehicle charging stations. Personal and business checks will be accepted. Those experiencing financial difficulty may request a monthly payment plan via mail or by emailing Collections@carrollcountymd.gov. The Collections Office can be reached by calling 410-386-2971.

Orioles making community, safety top priorities during coronavirus delay: ‘How do we take care of our people?’
.W
Much like the community at large, the Orioles aren’t sure what the future holds, but the organization is trying to prepare for a return to some form of normalcy with a focus on safety. Jennifer Grondahl, the Orioles’ senior vice president, community development and communications, has served as the team’s point person in Major League Baseball’s conversations with clubs about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On the 15-hour drive she took from Baltimore to Florida over the weekend, she figures seven of them were spent on conference calls as the Orioles and the league try to sort out the coming days, weeks and months. "We're taking this situation one day at a time,” Grondhal said on a conference call with reporters Thursday evening. “We've been working very closely together as a team. Our employees really have just been fantastic, stepped up to the plate, working very hard, most of them from home at this time. “What we know is we have to be really thoughtful to get everything right with all the questions that we're being faced with, but as an organization, every decision that we're making, every decision that we've made thus far is with the health and safety of our employees, players and fans in mind, so we're encouraging our players and fans to follow the guidelines, to lead by example, so we can be part of the solution, and that's our priority, and we do see our role in the community during baseball season as being leaders in the community, and certainly during this situation." The Orioles announced Tuesday that they would close their business offices through March 29, but Grondahl admitted that she wasn’t sure that date would necessarily be the time they would reopen. She was adamant, though, the offices will remain closed as long as they need to to be safe for those who work there. “Soon as we feel that we can open the doors, we will,” Grondahl said, “but not a moment sooner." That timing stands among a bevy of questions the Orioles are faced with on the business side of their organization that as of now don’t have answers. Grondahl said it would be “naive” to think the coronavirus pandemic’s financial implications on the Orioles won’t be “pretty substantial.” What exactly those implications are and many of the other uncertainties tie directly into the season’s unknown start date. On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked to restrict crowds of 50 or more for eight weeks, and MLB subsequently announced it would adhere to those guidelines, pushing Opening Day of the 2020 season to at least May 10, far from the March 26 date the Orioles were originally scheduled to begin the campaign. The need for players to get a spring training-like ramp-up could further delay the regular season. “I think all of us are in the same boat where this is something none of us have ever dealt with and certainly would never have expected to be dealing with,” Grondahl said. Major League Baseball announced Tuesday that all 30 of its teams will donate $1 million each to support ballpark employees during the delay, leaving it up to each team for how it will deploy that pledge. The Orioles are finalizing that decision, Grondahl said, performing analyses and consulting with other organizations. In 2015, when protests in Baltimore caused Oriole Park employees to miss out on four games of work, the Orioles reimbursed them for lost hours. As of Thursday, the club was unsure how much each worker would receive or for how long. “Ultimately, we’re going to do the best we can, and we’re going to be here for our employees, and we’ve committed to that,” Grondahl said. “You’ve seen how all of the 30 major league teams have committed to compensation for our seasonal ballpark employees, and that’s really where our focus is right now: How do we take care of our people?" Although three of those 2015 games were played as home games in St. Petersburg’s Tropicana Field, the other was notably played without fans, a situation Grondahl said she would be open to seeing repeat only if that was determined to be the safest route of action. "I'm in favor of whatever we have to do to keep in line with the CDC recommendations,” she said. “If we are able to put baseball players on a field and we feel that we can safely do that for their protection, I'm in favor of that. Of course, we would prefer to have fans at Oriole Park, just as the fans would prefer to be there, but I'm in favor of whatever we have to do that's a wise decision. “It's bigger than baseball for us. We want to do what's right for the community, and we'll follow the guidelines that are set for us." Although the team has announced its ticket refund policies for the exhibition home games that remained when spring training was canceled, it has yet to do so with regular-season tickets. Grondahl pointed to the Orioles’ official website, which states, in part, “We expect to be able to provide answers to all ticket related policy questions shortly after MLB is able to announce the changes this situation will have on the 2020 schedule.” It’s not yet determined whether it will be possible for the league to play its full 162-game season. The Orioles are also adjusting their own schedule that featured several entertainment and community-relations events at the ballpark and in the Baltimore region to keep fans engaged in the second full year of the franchise’s rebuilding process. For now, the team is working to rearrange dates on those that the delay could affect, Grondahl said, but hopes “to do as much as we can in the season that we have to do it in.” The team seemed to springboard itself into the season with a series of those types of events, with the Birdland Caravan in early February sending players, coaches and executives throughout the state to meet and interact with various groups of fans. Although it’s possible that the temporary shutdown could quell whatever momentum the Orioles had built within the fanbase through the caravan, Grondahl chose to take an optimistic view of the situation. “I do think what we experienced with Caravan was very telling about our fans and really how loyal they are to our organization as we're in this rebuild,” she said. “I think that the bright spot in this sort of cloudy day is that our fans will be really craving baseball, and if we can put together a baseball season and the entertainment that we have planned and add to that some of the other outreach that we're planning on doing, I feel like we'll be able to continue that momentum." For now, though, all is a standstill, with the season’s opening date unknown and much else to be determined.

Layoffs related to coronavirus have started at BWI, union leader says; D.C. and Virginia airports also hit hard
.W
Layoffs of skycaps and baggage handlers have started at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, according to a union official who says at least 78 workers for service companies already have been idled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds more, he says, have been laid off at Dulles International Airport in Virginia and Reagan National Airport in Washington. “I’m afraid this is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Jaime Contreras, vice president of Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ. “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” The union claims that 438 workers at Dulles and another 50 at Reagan were laid off within the last week. Other workers have had their hours cut. Companies that employ skycaps and fuel service workers at BWI could not be reached to confirm the layoffs. A spokesman for the airport said he could not confirm layoffs by private contractors. On Thursday, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan restricted access to the BWI terminal to ticketed passengers and necessary staff. Hit with a significant drop in travel demand, airlines across the country have reduced flights. Lobbyists have asked that the industry be included in a massive financial bailout being considered in Congress. On Thursday U.S. Treasury officials proposed $50 billion in secured loans for airlines. On Friday, Southwest Airlines said that, starting on Sunday, it would cut 1,000 of its 4,000 daily flights, including those to all international destinations. The airline said it could not provide specific information about the number of cancellations at each airport. BWI is a Southwest hub and last year the airline averaged 200 departures a day from the airport. In 2018, Southwest brought more than 18 million passengers through BWI. Ronaldo Dingzon, an immigrant from the Philippines, has been a skycap at BWI since 2011, assigned to the Southwest terminal. His layoff was effective March 18. Dingzon, who lives in Brooklyn, on Baltimore’s south side, says he supports his 79-year-old mother and pays her medical bills, which run between $200 and $300 a month. “I also help my family back home in the Philippines,” said Dingzon, a naturalized U.S. citizen. “I send tuition money to my kids to help them pay for college, and I help them with their everyday needs back home, including rent, food and other costs. Losing my job will make it harder for me to help my family back home.” In addition to skycaps, laid-off workers include wheelchair agents, baggage handlers, men and women who clean cabins after flights and ramp workers who load and unload baggage, guide planes to gates and drive baggage carts. Some of the affected workers refuel planes, Contreras said. “Some of them work two and three jobs at the airports to support their families,” he added. “The airlines are lobbying Congress for a bailout to prevent layoffs, but at the same time, those at the bottom need a bailout, too — mostly black and brown workers who live paycheck to paycheck, and are sadly at the end of the line when it comes to getting help.”

2 Carroll County nonprofits join to deliver pet food as families face difficulties during coronavirus
.W
Two Carroll County nonprofits joined forces to provide families food and supplies for their furry family members during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Together We Own It, a Westminster-based nonprofit that serves local children and families, teamed up with Hampstead-based MCQE Mobile Pet Pantry, a nonprofit that donates supplies and food for animals, to distribute food to families and their pets. Kirby said Together We Own It is distributing about 850 meals a week. Together We Own It partnered with MCQE to deliver pet food, and Together We Own It announced March 18 that they had delivered 350 pounds of pet food to local families. “The mobile food pantry reached out to us and said that they had a lot of people reaching out about getting food for their animals and didn’t really have a good way to deliver it with so many things that were being shut down,” said Katelyn Kirby, director of Together We Own It. The coronavirus also known as COVID-19, the disease it causes, has forced much of the population to spend most of their time at home and has sparked financial difficulties for many. Michele Szper, founder of MCQE, said she saw Together We Own It on Facebook and decided to team up to do their last mobile pet food distribution. No more mobile deliveries are planned at this time, so for now, if residents want supplies from MCQE, they have to coordinate picking it up. “We are not delivering, and we’re not doing any mobile pet food pantries at this time,” Szper said. “However, we have an appointment book set up; people can contact us through our pet pantry number or email or Facebook.” The pet pantry’s Facebook page is at www.facebook.com/mcqe.mobile.pet.pantry, its number is 443-507-6849 and its email is mcqe.pet.pantry@gmail.com. Even though Together We Own It is still helping the same people they always have, they say, they have noticed a need for additional services increased. To assess supplies people needed, Together We Own It put a request form on its website, www.togetherweownit.org, for people to fill out. “I would say 50 or 60 percent of people said that one of their needs was pet food, so we contacted them [MCQE], we were like ‘This is a great match.’ They came out and set up our first night of doing food and delivered pretty much everything they had,” Kirby said. According to Spzer, they distributed all kinds of pet food, for cats, dogs, rabbits and guinea pigs. They also gave out toys and treats as well. Spzer is also providing flea and tick medication while supplies last. The main priority for Together We Own It is now supplies for children. “We have so many unfulfilled requests for diapers, formula, toilet paper, baby wipes — it’s, that’s kind of our main focus right now,” said Angel Hill, director of youth development for Together We Own It. “We definitely, we understand that people love their pets and they need to feed their their animals, but our main focus is on getting those things. We have tons of canned food and they’re welcome to share that with their pets, but as far as the needs for our kids, it is dire, so that’s been our main focus right now.” Together We Own It hasn’t gotten many requests for pet food since the last pet food delivery, but when they do get a request they always add, for example, some cans of tuna if someone has a cat. Together We Own It is happy to help those who need it most during hard times brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. “So I’m just really excited to be out in this community and born and raised here,” Kirby said. “Excited to be giving back and just grateful for the community to be standing beside us and making this possible.” MCQE also has an Amazon Wishlist link on its website, mcqemobilepetpantry.com, so people can buy things to donate to the pantry and help others. People in need of pet food can also reach out to the Humane Society of Carroll County. According to Karen Baker, executive director of the Humane Society, they have cat food and dog food to spare, though it’s only a limited supply because they have sent a lot of their supplies to fosters. The only supply they have in stock is cat litter. To pick up food, patrons must call ahead and will receive curbside service. The Humane Society can be reached at 410-848-4810 and is located at 2517 Littlestown Pike in Westminster.

Reports of child abuse have fallen in Maryland since coronavirus shutdown, but experts say harm may be hidden
.W
Reports of child abuse and neglect have fallen sharply in Maryland since the coronavirus pandemic shut down most of the state, shuttering kids in their homes and away from the watchful eyes of teachers, health care workers and extended family. State Department of Human Services data show a dramatic decline in reports of children suffering possible harm, but that’s at the same time systems charged with protecting them have been hampered in their outreach by the pandemic. Caseworkers have begun doing some of their checks on families by phone or video. Courts reviewing child placements and family reunification efforts are, for the most part, closed. Experts fear that child maltreatment is going unreported. Especially worrisome, advocates say, is that families are enduring severe pressures — from job losses to depression, substance abuse and conflict triggered by isolation. “It is a dangerous time for children and families: We know no family intends to hurt their children, but the stressors are profound,” said Rita Soronen, president of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, a nonprofit that advocates for children in foster care. Across Maryland, Child Protective Services offices received nearly 70% fewer calls during the first two weeks in April compared to the same period last year. In 2019, officials got 958 calls in the first half of April. The state received 320 calls for the same period this year. The decline was evident during the progressive shutdown of businesses and government services in March. Calls went from 490 in the first week of March to 136 the last week of the month. Compared to March 2019, reports fell by almost one-third, to 1,492 last month from 2,176 a year ago. Katherine Morris, a spokeswoman for the human services department, implored community members to report any signs a child is being abused or neglected. Reports to local social services offices or law enforcement agencies can be made anonymously. Even during the outbreak, Child Protective Services workers are investigating allegations, and children in dangerous situations are being removed from their homes and placed in foster care for their protection. "We rely on communities to help alert us to these situations, so that we can take immediate action and ensure a safe environment for everyone,” Morris said in an email. Children living with parents who struggle with anger management and alcoholism or drug abuse face both immediate and long-term impacts, said Sheryl Brissett Chapman, who runs the National Center for Children and Families. The center serves families throughout Maryland and the District of Columbia, providing a range of services for young people and families dealing with violence, neglect, poverty and homelessness. Reopening the schools will be key to protecting children, she said. “School has been a source of identifying children who are not getting good enough [care] at home, who come to school hungry or fearful or injured," Chapman said. "And hungry can be physical and emotional. If you’re being called names, that can be as gripping as being hit, because it attacks your self-worth.” Nationally, about 20 percent of reports of child abuse come from schools, said Adam Rosenberg, who directs the Baltimore Child Abuse Center and is vice president for LifeBridge Health’s violence intervention and prevention efforts. Figures for the rate in Maryland were not available. Rosenberg said the child abuse center remains open during the pandemic. Its doctors, nurses and therapists see children daily for medical and forensic exams, including ones given when a child enters foster care. The team is also offering telemedicine visits. For their part, social workers are trying to stay in frequent contact with kids, families and foster parents virtually and over the phone, officials said. However, in-person visits with children in care are supposed to happen at least once a month; now that they don’t, advocates are concerned that social workers could miss signs of trouble, especially when children are young and not yet talking. And not all families have access to the internet or smartphones to replace the in-person visits with virtual ones. In Baltimore, where the digital divide is particularly acute, the city Department of Social Services is conducting surveys to figure out which families lack internet and computers, according to its director, Randi Walters. The agency is using its funding and support from philanthropies to get the families connected. Walters said the equipment is necessary for both the social workers to help navigate complicated family situations and protect children, but also to ensure parents and kids can stay connected even if they are separated and in group homes or living with foster parents or extended family. The first wave of the agency’s surveys in Baltimore shows most families do have the ability for video conferencing, but Walters said there are still more families to poll. Despite the social distancing requirements, any time social workers believe a child may be at imminent risk, they make face-to-face contact, said Morris, the human services department spokeswoman. Morris said the agency holds daily calls with the social services directors across the state to evaluate challenges and find appropriate responses. Services are continually being adapted, and staff members are “doing their very best to help keep Marylanders and each other safe.” “This is a fluid situation, requiring changes in policy and practice from day to day and minute to minute, at times,” Morris said. At Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Baltimore County — where volunteers appointed by judges advocate for the best interests of kids in foster care — volunteers are trying to increase communication with youth to help them feel supported. “Kids in care already feel isolated,” said executive director Jennifer Stine. “They already feel vulnerable and separated.” Another risk of the isolation is a potential rise in the viewing of sexually abusive images of children, because of the extra time people are spending online, said Elizabeth J. Letourneau, director of the Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Sexual abuse perpetrated by someone outside the family household would likely decrease during this time, but children could be at increased risk if their abuser is within the family due to the time spent at home, she said. Letourneau said that while “we don’t want adults to walk around with constant feelings of suspicion,” awareness of abuse and talking to kids about these issues is key. Advocates are worried, too, about the emotional hardship on children. Foster parents who get sick or lose their jobs may ask for the children in their care to be removed and placed in another home, which could leave children feeling abandoned and scared. The delay in court proceedings also means it will take longer in many cases for children to be reunified with their parents or have their adoptions finalized. The postponements are expected to create a backlog when the courts do reopen. Chapman, of the National Center for Children and Families, said she worries about the heartache that will be felt by families kept apart longer than they otherwise would be. For a mother on track to get her kids back from foster care, the outbreak could shake her foothold with the loss of a job or an inability to pay rent. “If they were poor before COVID, what do you think is happening to them now?" Chapman said. “If a child is removed from a family, they still have rights to a relationship with them until the courts say no. That is a journey and a process." As the child welfare system and its many workers are adapting rapidly to meet the needs, Soronen, of the Dave Thomas Foundation, said family members, friends and neighbors can also step up to ease the strain. Besides calling authorities when a child is in danger, people can drop off meals, offer to entertain a child with a virtual visit or send a letter or a gift in the mail. “If you know a neighbor is fostering or a neighbor is taking care of their grandchildren, offer to do something,” she said.

‘It’s getting harder’: As coronavirus spread, a Baltimore woman got home from overseas as window seemed to be closing
.W
From her apartment in Lima, Peru, Elana Liebow-Feeser attended to her job on Skype, chatted online with friends and family, watched “Harry Potter” movies, tried out dance moves from YouTube, and fashioned new recipes suffused with Old Bay — an homage to her Maryland roots. She tried not to worry that a window seemed to be closing on returning soon to Baltimore, so she could ride out the coronavirus pandemic with her parents and begin planning for medical school in the fall. But the situation seemed to growing dire. As COVID-19 has spread, many nations are closing borders and mandating quarantines. State Department and embassy officials have been signaling that their repatriation efforts are becoming more complicated. "It’s getting harder and harder,” said U.S. Rep. David Trone, a Maryland Democrat. “Every country is basically eliminating all international flights. You’ve got to get separate approval for a State Department flight to get in.” The U.S. State Department says it has coordinated the return of more than 38,000 Americans from 78 countries since the end of January. But an untold number of Marylanders are still waiting to return from overseas. The offices of Maryland’s Democratic U.S. senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, said recently that they were still working on dozens of cases involving Marylanders in such countries as Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Peru, Taiwan and Ukraine. Liebow-Feeser’s mother said Cardin called her at home in Baltimore during the anxious period, and that his staff members regularly relayed information. Sensing that time was running short, Liebow-Feeser, 23 — who had been coordinating a pediatric pneumonia study in Peru through a Johns Hopkins program — woke up before dawn on Friday and took a taxi to the U.S. embassy even though there were long lines outside the door and she was not among those on a manifest for a flight home. “She wasn’t on the list for Friday or Saturday, and Sunday was supposed to be the last day flights would leave. She was kind of freaked out,” said her mother, Elisabeth Liebow. “She didn’t make the first standby and she texted and said: ‘I didn’t get on. I don’t know what to do.’ ” But then she got a break. “She asked someone to check a list because Sen. Cardin had expressly sent her name to the embassy yesterday,” the mother said. Elana soon texted her mother: “I don’t know what happened but I’m the last one. They hand-wrote me and I had to run.” Her flight to Washington’s Dulles International Airport left late Friday afternoon. “The way she got out is like a scene out of a movie,” her mother said. Liebow-Feeser arrived home early Saturday. “It really felt like a very strange dream,” she said. She is self-isolating at the family’s home, making sure to keep her distance from her mother, who has asthma. “I’ll hug my mom in 14 days,” she said. In a statement after her return, Cardin said: " I am grateful Elena can be with her family today and I am appreciative of the tireless diplomats in Peru, and around the world, who continue to facilitate travel for those who want to come back to the U.S. These are tough times around the globe, but I will keep pressing until every Marylander who is still stranded has made their way back home.” She appeared to make it with little time to spare. On Thursday, the U.S. Embassy in Lima sent a memo to stranded Americans saying: “We will continue to facilitate daily travel and coordinate flights to repatriate Americans from all corners of Peru through April 5. U.S. citizens who remain in Peru beyond that date should continue to shelter in place.” The State Department in Washington declined to elaborate on the memo, referring a reporter to transcripts of recent department briefings. In one such briefing Wednesday, department official Ian Brownlee urged U.S. citizens seeking to return from abroad “to make arrangements to do so now,” saying there is “no guarantee the Department of State will be able to continue to provide repatriation assistance.” Upon hearing that, Van Hollen said in an interview: “We cannot abandon any Americans who are trying to get home." Van Hollen wrote last month to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the many inquiries he was receiving from Marylanders across the globe. “In most cases, the Department of State has provided no assistance, or clear guidance, to facilitate their safe travel back to the United States," Van Hollen told Pompeo. The senator said Thursday that the department appears to have “significantly stepped up its efforts" since then, but more work remained. Trone said more than two dozen of his constituents were stuck in Peru, but most are out now. Among them were Sarah Gleason of Montgomery County, who was living with a host family in a study abroad program. After her mother reached out to Trone and other elected officials, the daughter flew home March 25 with her sister, Julie, a Towson University graduate student. The American Embassy helped them get seats on the flight. “Hope this helps others not give up and continue to get their loved ones home during this very stressful time in the world,” said their mother, Kim Gleason. Even the trip home can be harrowing. Kelsey Day, a 22-year-old University of Maryland, Baltimore County, student, returned to late Thursday to Baltimore after an exhausting, two-day trip that was a logistical feat. She had taken a semester off to travel, but had been under lockdown in Italy for the last month. Amid strict Italian travel protocols, she hitched a ride to a train station an hour from where her host family lives, took a train to Rome and spent the night on the airport floor. After various health screenings, she endured a strange flight to the United States on which each passenger was isolated in a separate row. Day’s parents drove from Anne Arundel County to meet her at the BWI Airport Rail Station, one driving their car and one driving Day’s car. They greeted her at the station from 10 feet away, tossed her car keys to her, and told her how happy they were to have her home. It was “the biggest, craziest whirlwind,” she said. Liebow-Feeser can certainly relate. She was to have completed her 18-month program at the end of April, but began trying to get home March 15 after Peru announced a state of emergency because of the virus. She speaks Spanish and said she is usually quite comfortable in Peru, which she calls “a wonderful country.” But this situation was disorienting. Outside Liebow-Feeser’s apartment, she said, there was a heavy police presence. Martin Vizcarra, the country’s president, announced Thursday that — to minimize the number of people going to grocery stores at the same time — men would be permitted outside on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Women are permitted outside on alternate days, except Sunday, when nobody is permitted on the streets. As of Friday, there were more than 1,595 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Peru, and 61 people had died from the disease Baltimore Sun reporter Kevin Rector contributed to this article

Trump turning coronavirus crisis into a messaging war where perception and Fox News matter more than people and science | COMMENTARY
.W
President Donald Trump is trying to turn the greatest medical crisis of our lives into a messaging war. Forget science; focus on media and perception. That’s where Mr. Trump’s emphasis has clearly moved this week, even as the nation engages in a monumental debate about saving lives vs. restarting the economy, perhaps as soon as Easter. But this is one war the president might lose at the hands of the very weapons he used to get elected: social media and cable TV. How would that be for irony? Monday night, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC all cut away from a White House briefing on the virus. The bully pulpit didn’t seem so bully as MSNBC and CNN offered live interviews and taped comments from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and an array of medical experts. The White House issued an angry statement in response Monday night calling the decision by the cable channels to leave the president’s session “disgraceful." On Tuesday, Mr. Trump fired back at the lack of coverage by headlining a noon-hour, live, virtual town hall from the Rose Garden on Fox News with Bill Hemmer and Harris Faulkner as hosts. It was vintage Fox-Trump propaganda with the president trying to rewrite history to explain how brilliant he has been and how “unfair” mainstream media are in their coverage of him. Not all media, mind you. Mr. Trump went out of his way to say what a “fantastic person” Ms. Faulkner is. Mr. Trump rewarded Fox for its unchallenged airtime and safe questions with a scoop: He said during the town hall that he wanted to see America back to work by Easter. It was the president’s way of showing he could make headlines. And those who play his game will gain, while those who resist will get pain. First in line for pain during the Fox broadcast was Mr. Cuomo, who had been going out of his way to get along with Mr. Trump during the crisis. That changed Tuesday morning, though, when the New York governor criticized Mr. Trump’s administration for sending him only 400 ventilators when he had requested 20,000. “FEMA says, ‘We’re sending 400 ventilators.’ Really? What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000?” Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Cuomo directly, claiming that Mr. Cuomo had a chance to buy 16,000 ventilators in 2015 and turned it down to establish “death panels and lotteries instead.” According to The Daily Beast, Mr. Trump’s source for that claim was an article from The Gateway Pundit, an inflammatory right-wing publication known for its promotion of conspiracy theories. That’s straight from the Trump handbook of using dodgy data to smear his opponents. This is where Mr. Trump is now directing his energy instead of focusing on how to best save lives. The good media news as Mr. Trump tries to drag the national coronavirus conversation into his gutter of personal attacks is that social media and cable TV are providing powerful platforms for voices of science, reason and facts. Case in point: the sobering Twitter thread that Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the John Hopkins Center for Health Security, published Monday night in response to Mr. Trump’s mounting advocacy for lifting stay-at-home restrictions as soon as possible after a 15-day shutdown ends next week. “Anyone advising the end of social distancing now, needs to fully understand what the country will look like if we do that," Dr. Inglesby wrote. “COVID would spread widely, rapidly, terribly, could kill potentially millions in the yr ahead with huge social and economic impact across the country.” Dr. Inglesby’s voice was amplified by thousands on social media. A parade of scientists, medical doctors and public health officials have appeared on cable channels MSNBC and CNN this week with similar warnings. Unfortunately, instead of a unified, governmental and scientific war on the virus, as Mr. Cuomo and others have been calling for, Mr. Trump is trying to lead us back into open warfare with each other. A divided nation might be good for him and his allies, but not for us at this deadly moment in our nation’s life, especially for the most vulnerable among us. David Zurawik is The Sun’s media critic.

The Y in Central Maryland reopens family centers to care for children of workers on front lines of coronavirus fight 
.W
The Y in Central Maryland is opening its 11 family centers to provide child care for hundreds of children of first responders and front line health care workers, the organization announced Tuesday. Beginning Wednesday, the Y will host 700 kids, ages 4 to 12, so their parents can continue their essential jobs. Slots are limited to the children of certain hospital workers and people in emergency services. Child care will be provided from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Parents who qualify can register at ymaryland.org/emergencypersonnelservices. The centers are not open to the general public. Nearly all of the Y’s regular programming is closed temporarily due to the coronavirus pandemic, including its after-school sites, Head Start classes and swim centers. The child care services are being offered in partnership with the state education and health departments. There will be no cost for the service with the state funding some of the expenses and the Y looking to raise money to cover the rest. John Hoey, president of the Y in Central Maryland, said the nonprofit has the “expertise, the people and facilities” to serve the families of nurses, doctors, police, firefighters and others the community relies on. “There is no one better equipped to do this,” Hoey said. Gov. Larry Hogan ordered all nonessential companies to close on Monday, but said day care centers were among the places that could remain open. The governor added that the state “may be taking further action” with regard to day care centers this week, but he did not provide more details. The state so far has mandated specific child care services continue for the children of emergency workers, an action that has alarmed some day care workers. Some of the workers have signed an online petition to close the centers amid fears the virus will spread and they will not be able to protect themselves or the kids. Meanwhile, the state’s public schools have been shut down temporarily during the outbreak. At the Y child care sites, everyone will be screened for fevers before entering the buildings to keep the children and workers safe. Inside, groups will be kept to no more than 10 people in a space. Further precautions will include frequent hand-washing and extra cleaning. Derryck Fletcher, the Y’s senior vice president of youth development, said the organization is following all of the recommendations and guidelines from health experts. That includes checking temperatures throughout the day and taking specific steps when someone begins to display symptoms. Programming for the children will be drawn from the Y camps and after-school curriculum. Hoey said the organization’s ability to pivot its mission is a demonstration of its “responsiveness, resourcefulness and character.” He said he was “deeply proud” of the Y’s staff. The new mission comes during a challenging time for many other nonprofits and businesses. The Y has furloughed about two-thirds of its 3,100-member staff with an extra week’s pay and the hope to bring them back as soon as possible. “We’re an organization that is also trying to figure out how are we going to make it through this,” Hoey said. Operating the day care programs will take about 100 of the Y’s staff. The Y also is assisting the state in providing “grab and go” meals for families in need. Additionally, the nonprofit is staying in regular contact with its 1,600 Head Start families with regular phone calls and online check-ins. Workers are helping families access food and offering lessons parents can provide at home to keep their kids engaged, learning and healthy. People also can access the Y’s online exercise classes and family enrichment activities. Resources are available through the organization’s social media and electronic mailings. The goal is to give families ways to stay healthy in spirit, mind and body during the pandemic, the organization said. Hoey thanked the families who have chosen to maintain their Y memberships even while the physical sites are closed. He said those membership dues become charitable contributions during the crisis, because of the Y’s nonprofit status. The money supports all of the Y’s community outreach efforts. “Our members, along with donors, funders and other partners are critical to our ability to provide these vital community services and to remain viable through this crisis,” Hoey said. “Without them, this work would not be possible.” For first responders and health care workers, the nonprofit Maryland Family Network also is working to help them find child care arrangements. Parents in essential professions can call the network or chat online to get information.

Howard County 5-year-old is first Maryland child with confirmed coronavirus; Hogan says some Marylanders treating crisis like ‘spring break’ 
.W
A 5-year-old girl in Howard County became the first Maryland child to test positive for the new coronavirus, Gov. Larry Hogan said Thursday as he imposed new measures to slow the outbreak’s spread — including closing shopping malls and amusement parks and further limiting community gatherings. The governor, at an Annapolis news conference, also urged residents to use transit only for essential travel and asked the University System of Maryland to finish the semester online. The two-term Republican governor appeared exasperated that some Marylanders were not heeding previous warnings limiting large gatherings. “Despite all of our repeated warnings for weeks and despite the rapid escalation of this virus across our state, the region, the nation and the world, some people are treating this like a vacation or a spring break with parties, cookouts and large gatherings at some of our parks,” he said. "Let me be very clear. If you are engaged in this type of activity, you are in violation of state law and you are endangering the lives of your fellow Marylanders.” He amended a previous executive order to require Marylanders to “reduce the size of social, cultural, and community gatherings to 10 people.” The order now mandates the closure of enclosed shopping malls, bowling alleys, pool halls, amusement parks and skating rinks. Maryland added 22 more confirmed cases Thursday, reaching 107, but the 5-year-old was Maryland’s lone case of anyone under 18. There are 76 cases of coronavirus among Marylanders aged 18 to 64 and 30 in those 65 and older. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties remain those most affected, with 33 and 23 confirmed cases, respectively. There are eight confirmed cases in Baltimore City and 12 in Baltimore County. Howard schools Superintendent Michael Martirano said in a systemwide email that he was made aware of the 5-year-old’s confirmed case by Hogan’s Thursday news conference. The child attends Elkridge Elementary School. To protect the child’s privacy, the school system did not provide additional information. Elkridge Elementary Principal Mike Caldwell has spoken with the family and will be reaching out to the school’s other families and staff, Martirano said. “It saddens me greatly to know that this pandemic has now hit so close to home,” Martirano said. Anticipating a surge in cases, Hogan said 900 new hospital beds have been made available and he expected 1,400 to be available by early April. Hogan and Maryland legislators say they also are trying to minimize the economic harm the virus is inflicting on the state. The governor, joined by House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson, signed legislation aimed at protecting Marylanders by barring price gouging and enhancing job protections related to the virus. The measure “protects Marylanders from the economic hardships that may result from this pandemic,” Hogan tweeted. Later in the evening, speaking on WUSA-TV in Washington, Hogan said Maryland had received approval for local companies to apply for U.S. Small Business Administration disaster assistance programs created in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Maryland’s U.S. attorney warned residents to be on the lookout for potential scams and scammers, part of an effort to protect people from those trying to profit off the coronavirus. Almost daily, Hogan has convened news conferences outdoors in Annapolis to outline and step up the state’s effort to limit the virus. The measures have changed Marylanders’ daily lives in ways that would have been unimaginable a few weeks ago. “This truly is one of the most daunting challenges our state has ever faced,” Hogan said. “But sometimes the worst times have a way of bringing out the very best in people." On Monday, Hogan ordered bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms closed. Since then, an increasing number of retail outlets and malls — but not all — closed on their own. Grocery stores, banks, pharmacies and other essential services remain open. Hogan said a new executive order is being issued allowing for delivery and carryout sales of alcohol by restaurants, bars, distilleries and wineries, subject to local regulations. "But I want to urge people to be responsible and to avoid large crowds in stores,” he said. Hogan also restricted access to the BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport terminal to ticketed passengers and necessary staff, and urged Marylanders to limit use of transit to essential personnel such as emergency and health care workers. The governor did not announce new measures for Maryland schools, which were ordered closed from this past Monday until March 27. The state schools superintendent has been consulting regularly with officials of local school districts, he said. Later Thursday, the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents met and it was announced that face-to-face classes are done for the remainder of the academic year for undergraduates at its 12 institutions. Arrangements for graduate students are not yet clear. Students will receive their room and board back on a pro-rated basis, and tuition and room and board payment deadlines for the next semester will be extended. Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association, had earlier criticized the federal government for not giving “clear directives” to curb the pandemic. He joined other governors on a call Thursday with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to push for equipment and other needs. Maryland is seeking better supplies of coronavirus test kits, personal protective equipment for health care workers, and ventilators. Hogan said he also is seeking more flexibility for using the National Guard and more time to complete both the census and the transition to REAL ID, an initiative intended to make identity documents more secure. Hogan also urged healthy residents to donate blood. The American Red Cross is seeking blood donations after drives were canceled amid coronarivus concerns. “We’re all in this together," he said. “And if we all do our part, if we rise to this challenge to meet this moment, we will get through this together.” Baltimore Sun Media reporters Liz Bowie, Jess Nocera and Pamela Wood contributed to this story.

Orioles slugger Chris Davis was ushered out of the team’s semi-quarantined clubhouse Tuesday afternoon to meet with reporters and speak for his teammates about the measures that Major League Baseball and other major sports leagues are taking to protect against the growing threat from the coronavirus. The MLB response has been fairly basic to this point. The most visible aspect of it at the Ed Smith Stadium complex was the outdoor news conference with the media — who are temporarily prohibited from entering the locker room, matching protocol in the NBA, NHL and MLS — instructed to remain at least six feet away from Davis and any other players made available. To hear Davis and some teammates tell it, there is more hand-washing than hand-wringing over the spreading pandemic. “I definitely don’t like that term, but you can’t let it run how you live,’’ Davis said. “You can be cautious and take certain measures to make sure that you’re protected, but at the same time you’ve got to live your life. We have a job to do. We have a responsibility, not only to the organization but to our fans to go out there and do our job. We’ve been faced with a lot of challenges here in the past … and I think the general focus of our clubhouse is to go out there and continue to do that.” No doubt, there will be more to come from MLB if the situation continues to worsen. There has been speculation that some of the major sports will either postpone games or play them without fans in the stands, a situation Baltimore fans remember well from the Freddie Gray unrest in 2015. “I hope not," Davis said. “They’re going to do everything they can to protect the players and the fans, but I hope that it doesn’t turn into us missing games or pushing scheduled games back. I saw just a few minutes ago on ESPN or one of the outlets that the NBA was talking about playing games without fans in the seats. We don’t even want to go down that road again.” Some organizations have already started barring fans. Johns Hopkins did not allow spectators to attend NCAA Division III basketball games on its campus this past weekend, the Ivy League canceled its men’s basketball tournament Monday and all professional soccer games in Spain, France and Portugal, as well as some in Germany and a European Championship qualifying match in Slovakia, will be played in empty stadiums because of the outbreak. Infielder Richie Martin said he hadn’t heard of that possibility and hopes that it doesn’t become a reality. “It would be a little disappointing," Martin said. “Whatever it is to keep everyone safe, that’s the No. 1 priority. We want to play in front of our home crowd and on the road, but if that’s what needs to be done, then that’s probably the best way to go about it.” Manager Brandon Hyde acknowledged the awkward nature of the two-arms-length interview restriction, but said that the team is ready to do whatever the experts decide is the best way to keep the virus from invading big league clubhouses. “People know a lot more than I do higher up," he said. “I’m going to follow the regulations that MLB put out for us and just hoping for the best going forward. It’s something that we’re going to stick to right now and follow what they tell us to do.” The players are still processing what was handed down, but those that spoke Tuesday said that they would were supportive of the attempt by MLB to be proactive in dealing with the crisis. “I think guys are still kind of trying to figure it out," Davis said. “Obviously, we had the announcement several days ago that there’s going to be hand sanitizer everywhere, even more so than there already was, and to make sure to practice personal hygiene to the fullest. And, also, with the interaction with fans.” Instead of the occasional pregame autograph at the railing, which is one of the things that gives spring training its charm, Davis said that teams have encouraged players to carry signed baseballs with them onto the field and flip them to fans. “The way we have been going about that,” he said, “once the game starts just taking a ball out there and tossing a ball instead of mingling and shaking hands and doing all that stuff. It’s unusual. It’s definitely something we’re not accustomed to, but I guess if MLB sees it necessary for the time being, we’ll abide. “That was kind of an idea that they presented to us a few days ago when we started talking about interaction with the fans, and making sure you’re not coughing on anybody or sharing germs. You don’t want to exclude any fans or neglect them.” Despite the furor, Davis and Martin said that over the past few days the worldwide coronavirus outbreak has not been a particularly hot topic of conversation in the clubhouse. “We haven’t really gotten in depth with it," Martin said. “Mainly, just being smart about it.” Of course, the subject is pretty hard to ignore, since it has spread fear throughout the world and sent global financial markets into free-fall. “It’s on every news channel," Davis said. “We see the headlines. We know it’s being talked about in the community and the general public. For us, it’s more just doing everything that we can to keep ourselves and our fans in a safe environment.”

Johns Hopkins Student Government Association asks for partial tuition refund as coronavirus forces classes to go online 
.W
The Johns Hopkins University student government association last week asked the university’s president and the chair of its board of trustees for a partial refund of students’ tuition. In a letter dated March 31 from the Johns Hopkins Student Government Association to university President Ronald J. Daniels and Lou Forster, the chair of JHU’s board of trustees, the SGA requested a 25% remission of tuition fees for the spring 2020 semester after Johns Hopkins elected to complete the semester online because of the new coronavirus pandemic. Last week, the board of regents for the University System of Maryland, which does not include Johns Hopkins, unanimously voted in favor of partial refunds of student fees for room, board, parking and athletics. Johns Hopkins has announced it will issue pro-rated refunds for on-campus housing, as well as meal plans. “While we can appreciate the efforts that our University has taken to issue credits on unused portions of students living in on-campus housing and with a dining/meal plan, we ask that the University do more to support its students,” the SGA’s letter reads. "Specifically, we believe that The Johns Hopkins University should refund 25% of student’s tuition fees for the Spring 2020 semester. " The SGA wrote that it determined that figure because the latter half of the spring semester will be taught exclusively online and, citing a March 10 letter from U.S. senators to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, it believes that online learning is not equivalent to the in-class education students paid for. Johns Hopkins has a per-semester tuition of $27,675 for undergraduate students enrolled in either the School of Arts and Sciences or the School of Engineering. The university’s Peabody Institute charges an annual enrollment of $51,077. Each undergraduate student would be refunded around $7,000 if university leadership eventually complies with the SGA’s request. In an email Sunday, university spokeswoman Karen Lancaster wrote “at this time Johns Hopkins University is not offering tuition refunds. “We recognize that there may be challenges for some students as we move forward with remote learning,” Lancaster wrote. “Yet we are confident that our faculty and students are rising to the challenge of this altered educational landscape, utilizing tools and technologies to make the most of extraordinary times.” “With instruction continuing online, the core educational experience for students continues to include the same access to the time, resources, and expertise of our faculty and curriculum, as well as many of the surrounding supports normally provided for students, including academic advising, career planning and life design, health and wellness resources, libraries, and information technology support,” Lancaster wrote. SGA President Pavan Patel, disagrees, saying that the move to online courses will eliminate the hands-on learning done in laboratory settings that is necessary for medical degrees. He pointed to how some schools at the university are adopting universal pass/fail grading systems for the spring semester, saying that “it’s not business as usual right now.” “It shouldn’t just be part of the business model that we have to pay the same price tag,” Patel said. The letter to university officials also cites the lack of hands-on learning experiences, saying that the online classes held so far do not serve as an ample alternative. “Our Professors continue to do their best through Zoom and other means, and we are grateful for their effort and dedication,” the SGA’s letter read. “However, it is clear that this online mode of education has not ultimately lived up to the Johns Hopkins standard. Additionally, many of the facilities and services, such as labs, recreation center, library, the counseling center, and Learning Den remain inaccessible to students who pay sizeable fees in exchange for their use.” Attached to the SGA’s letter was a Change.org petition for the partial tuition refund with more than 2,000 signatures, as well as comments on the petition from students. The SGA also included a letter from several members of Johns Hopkins’ 2020 class and a handful of students in subsequent classes asking Provost Sunil Kumar and deans Beverly Wendland, T.E. Schlesinger and Smita Ruzicka to allow students in their final semester to be part-time students and graduate and asking for an extension of the tuition refund semester for the spring 2020 semester. “While we can appreciate the University’s current unprecedented predicament, we call on University leadership to take appropriate action in providing financial compensation to the student body,” the SGA’s letter reads. “In these difficult times, we believe that students must not be the only ones expected to bear the brunt of the cost. Instead, we must all collectively make sacrifices; that includes our beloved institution." Baltimore Sun reporter Phil Davis contributed to this article.

Howard County reports its first coronavirus case; Ball declares state of emergency; Columbia mall to close for a week; CA shuts down
.W
Howard County on Sunday confirmed its first case of coronavirus, as County Executive Calvin Ball has declared a state of emergency and announced that The Mall in Columbia and other commercial gathering places will be closed for at least a week. The first confirmed case in the county is an 82-year-old woman with an underlying health condition who is a resident at Lorien Health Services’ Elkridge facility. She is being treated at a hospital, though Howard County could not confirm which one. Lorien Health Services said they notified residents and visitors who were in close contact with the patient. They also said there were no confirmed cases at their other three locations. “Six members of our department were exposed to the patient. All providers have been contacted, are self-quarantining and are in relatively good spirits considering the circumstances,” said acting Fire Chief Bill Anuszewski. Howard County Health Officer Maura Rossman said there was limited information but that the patient has generally not been in the public. "This is a time for calm and reason. We all need to do our part,” Rossman said. At the 3:30 p.m. news conference, Ball signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency effective Sunday at midnight. Ball also announced sweeping social distancing measures, including closing the mall, excluding restaurants with external access, closing the shops at Savage Mill and closing the county’s movie theaters beginning Sunday at midnight for at least seven days. “We need to remain vigilant but calm. That means to continue social distancing,” Ball said at the news conference. Columbia Association announced at 4 p.m. on its website that all of its facilities are closing at 6 p.m. Sunday through March 29. This includes all sport and fitness facilities (fitness clubs, Haven on the Lake, pools, tennis, ice skating, golf, Columbia SportsPark, etc.); all Community Services facilities, including Columbia Art Center, Youth and Teen Center, and Columbia Archives; and Columbia DogPark, CA Headquarters and the Customer and Member Service Center. Additionally, all CA public programs, classes and events are canceled effective immediately through March 29. A decision whether to extend these closures and cancellations beyond March 29 will be made as additional information becomes available, Columbia Association said. County Council members were told about the first confirmed case shortly after 2 p.m. but were told not to attend the news conference to comply with state and national advice to control social distancing. “We have been preparing for this to happen and are following recommendations of the Health Department on how to further slow community spread,” Ball said in a prepared statement. “Over the past week the State and County have taken significant proactive measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by encouraging social distancing, the cancellation of events, meetings and gatherings, the closing of schools, libraries, and our community college." We will continue to work as a united and unified Howard County government along with our stakeholder partners to ensure that all our residents remain safe, calm and informed.” The Maryland Health Department reported on Sunday at 10 a.m. that there are now 31 confirmed cases of coronavirus statewide, which is up five from Saturday. Mike Ricci, the governor’s spokesman, noted in the late afternoon on Twitter that the Howard case is not one of the 31.

Johns Hopkins researcher wants to fight coronavirus with a serum made from the blood of recovered patients
.W
A Johns Hopkins public health researcher is urging that a serum be developed that they think could potentially become a powerful weapon in the battle against the global coronavirus pandemic. In an article published Friday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, researcher Arturo Casadevall, of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, writing with Liise-anne Pirofski, of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, argue that blood injections from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 might help protect at-risk people — including health care workers and family members caring for sick relatives — from falling prey to the disease. The serum could also be used to treat people who are already ill, though the researchers anticipate that in these cases the serum might be less effective. “Time is of the essence,” they wrote in the opinion piece titled “The convalescent sera option for containing COVID-19.” “As we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, we recommend that institutions consider the emergency use of convalescent sera and begin preparations as soon as possible." Casadevall and Pirofski could not be reached immediately for comment. The traditional treatment for viruses is with a vaccine frequently made from a weakened or dead form of the microbe that causes the disease, which stimulates the patient’s immune system to attack the intruder. According to published reports, health officials have estimated that it will take 12 to 18 months to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. In contrast, a serum would use antibodies, or Y-shaped proteins designed to bombard a particular virus or bacteria. “Currently there are no vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or drugs available for SARS-CoV-2,” Casadevall and Pirofski wrote. “Human convalescent serum is an option for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease that could be rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered and can donate immunoglobulin-containing serum.” Though serums were once widely used, they fell out of favor when new forms of treatment were developed. “Passive antibody therapy has a storied history going back to the 1890s,” the researchers wrote, “and was the only means of treating certain infectious diseases prior to the development of antimicrobial therapy in the 1940s.” The article argues that serums have been helpful in fighting recent international epidemics, including the 2003 SARS1 (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, the 2009 Swine Flu epidemic, the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic and the 2013 West African Ebola epidemic. “Although every viral disease and epidemic is different, these experiences provide important historical precedents that are both reassuring and useful as humanity now confronts COVID-19," they wrote. For example, when a serum was used to treat 80 SARS patients in Hong Kong in 2003, people who received the treatment before their illness reached the two-week mark were released from the hospital by the 22nd day. That result is “consistent with the notion that earlier administration is more likely to be effective,” the article said. “Historical experience suggests that convalescent sera may be more effective in preventing disease than in the treatment of established disease." Nonetheless, they argued that the sera could perform a crucial role in preventing the nation’s health care system from collapsing. Some physicians, nurses, and first responders have developed COIVD-19 after caring for patients who are ill with the disease — including an unnamed provider at Hopkins. As a result, these medical professionals are being quarantined at the time their expertise is needed the most. If the serum proves effective, “individuals who receive convalescent sera may be able to avoid a period of quarantine,” the article said. “This could allow them to continue their critical function as health care providers. "Convalescent sera could also be used to prevent disease among family members caring for COVID-19 patients at home.” The researchers acknowledges that a sera would be at best “clearly a stop-gap measure” and wouldn’t be risk-free. Among other things, there’s a danger that some patients could receive the wrong kind of blood. But Casadevall and Pirofski wrote that possibility has diminished in recent years as screening practices at blood banks have improved. The article listed several conditions that would have to be met for the use of the serum to have its maximum impact: There would have to be widespread testing to determine who has been infected and who has not.  Patients who have recovered from the coronavirus would have to agree to donate blood.  Widespread coordination would be required between medical researchers, physicians, hospitals and blood banks nationwide. “The high mortality of COVID-19 particularly in elderly and vulnerable persons,” the researchers wrote, “suggests that the benefits of [the serum’s use] use ... outweigh the risks.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated a co-author’s affiliation with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Do your homework and we’ll shave our heads: Baltimore school gets creative to keep students engaged during coronavirus
.W
The kids could be heard giggling through the computer as they watched their assistant principal shave off hunks of his hair while seated in his living room. In another box on the computer screen a teacher was having the back of her head shaved by a roommate in a kitchen. The Lakeland Elementary School students filled the chat window with rapid-fire reactions. “Oh my Lord, he is going to be bald,” a student voice said. “When are we going back to school? I want to go back to school now and see him bald." In the days of COVID-19, teachers and administrators have to get creative to keep students engaged. For the past two weeks, teachers at the Baltimore City school have been challenging their fourth graders to complete assignments. Complete a certain number of assignments in each subject collectively and someone will get a pie in the face, or, as happened this week, shaving a couple heads with clippers. As with a lot of school activities during the coronvirus shutdown, all this happened online on a learning platform where students and teachers could see each other. “We were looking for a way to motivate our students and create a sense of community in our fourth grade,” said fourth grade teacher Katie Degener. Educators said they’re seering signs the novelty of online education is wearing off for students, particularly those who were trying to do everything on a smart phone. The school handed out laptops this week and, combined with the challenge, that helped motivate students, teachers said. Nearly every student in the school have connected with school at least once a week in some form, and about three quarters are connecting three times a week. Fourth grade student King Alston said the assignments were so much easier on his new computer. He didn’t really think his teachers would go through with the hair cuts. After tuning in with his classmates, he counted down — “3, 2, 1!” — and the clippers whirred. ″Oh, they are really doing this. Crazy. I was really surprised," Alston said. Emma Sarfaty, who teaches English as a second language, said her new cut was “a little rough, but it will do for now.” Assistant Principal Justin Holbrook said his new clean look felt good. “I used to have my hair cut like this when I started teaching. My wife is not happy, but I feel I lost my COVID-19 pounds.”

Facing uneasy budget picture due to coronavirus, Carroll County commissioners look to cut costs, raise fees
.W
Carroll County’s commissioners, facing a budget planning process with more uncertainty than usual thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, on Thursday sought ways to reduce expenses by raising fees. Ted Zaleski, director of management and budget, said in previous meetings with the Board of County Commissioners that he had concerns about the fiscal year 2021 budget before the COVID-19 disease, caused by the novel coronavirus, hit Carroll. Now, with the pandemic’s economic damage to consider, there is an added layer of uncertainty in the budget process. All decisions made by commissioners during budget meetings are conditional upon the budget being adopted. The commissioners may still change their minds until the budget is finalized in May. On April 2, in a remote session held via live-streamed video, the commissioners focused on raising some fees and creating a new fee so that more money is coming in and less is going out. A fee is set to cover the cost incurred by the county to provide a service. Fees cannot generate revenue for the county and cannot be set higher than what it costs to provide a service, according to Zaleski. Commissioner Dennis Frazier, R-District 3, suggested raising landfill fees to improve the budget picture. He proposed increasing the waste disposal fee for licensed haulers from $64 per ton to $65, generating an additional $100,000 annually. The commissioners unanimously approved the motion, which will be effective Jan. 1, 2021. The commissioners voted, 4-1, to eliminate waste disposal coupons, saving the county nearly $193,000 annually. Commissioner Richard Weaver, R-District 2, voted against the motion. “Each property owner in Carroll County receives two waste disposal coupons with their property tax bill,” Cliff Engle, bureau chief of solid waste, wrote in an email. “The coupons are good for free disposal of waste up to 500 pounds per coupon.” Engle did not know the coupon program’s origin or how long it has been around. He said the county distributes about 131,000 coupons annually, but the vast majority go unused. In fiscal year 2019, 17,224 coupons, or 13%, were redeemed, according to Engle. After a lengthy discussion involving Engle and Eric Burdine, deputy director of public works, the commissioners unanimously voted to create a recycling disposal fee for licensed haulers at $30 per ton, also starting Jan. 1. The change is expected to generate $450,000 annually. Engle said it costs about $80 per ton to process recycling, not including the cost to transport and load the material. Upon hearing this, Commissioner Eric Bouchat, R-District 4, pushed for the fee to be even higher. Engle said creating a new, high fee where there was none before could shock the haulers and lead to them seeking business elsewhere or recycling less. The commissioners agreed to start with a lower fee. After returning from a two-hour recess, the commissioners voted, 4-1, to increase certain development review fees to cover the salary costs incurred to provide these services. Commissioner Ed Rothstein, R-District 5, voted against the motion. “I think we should be looking at other ways to cut funding within the county as opposed to adding this type of revenue on the backs of developers, on the backs of the community, and that’s exactly what I feel like we’re doing," Rothstein said. Five out of 15 county agencies involved in development review charge fees for services, according to Tom Devilbiss, director of the Department of Land and Resource Management. Devilbiss jokingly called the fee structure a “three for one deal." In February, Devilbiss told the commissioners the current fee structure was set in 1995. It has been modified only slightly since. County agencies of development review, engineering, stormwater management, floodplain and forest conservation currently charge fees for development review-related services, Devilbiss then said. About $568,000 in salaries alone is spent in the development review process, Devilbiss said Thursday. Fees recouped an average of 40% spent to provide these services in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. That does not include other expenses such as printing or using county vehicles. Devilbiss found, based on county archives from 1999, that the original intent of the fee structure appeared to be to recover 50% of the entire cost to provide development review services. Frazier made a motion to increase existing development review-related fees to recoup the entire cost of salaries spent to provide services. Deb Effingham, bureau chief of the budget, calculated the difference. She found the change will bring in $342,000 annually and increase as salaries rise. “I don’t see it as we’re trying to grow government here,” Frazier said. “We’re trying to make the end user ... pay for at least half of what the actual permit or fee or whatever it happens to be, actually costs, and not be subsidized by the rest of the people in the county.” Zaleski said salaries account for about half of the costs incurred in the development review process. Rounding out the fee discussion, Jason Green, deputy director of public works, came to the commissioners with a proposal to raise fees in the permits office. Green said he consulted with a committee of people who work in the building industry to determine increases to fees, such as electrical, plumbing and building fees. The increases range from $10 to $20 per fee, he said. Weaver said most of the changes were suggested to keep up with inflation. Currently, these fees recoup about 65% of what’s spent to provide them, Green said, proposing to raise them to cover 78%. After Green assured the commissioners that the new fees were supported by the committee, they voted unanimously in favor of them. The increase will generate about $222,000 annually. The commissioners’ next budget meeting is scheduled for April 7.

‘They never cease to amaze me’: Carroll Hospital nurses on the front lines, in the spotlight during coronavirus pandemic
.W
With health care workers in the spotlight and on the front lines, adapting to ever-changing protocols and dangers during the COVID-19 pandemic, National Nurses Week begins Wednesday and runs through May 12, Florence Nightingale’s birthday. It’s going to be a special celebration this year, even as the pandemic alters the way nurses are honored. “Nurses week is a big one and we have had to change it from what we typically are able to do do just because of social distancing,” said Carroll Hospital Chief Nursing Officer Stephanie Reid. “We are still trying to make our nurses feel appreciated.” That will mean more individual recognition rather than the usual meal and celebration with nursing staff, according to Reid, but she said all 450 nurses working with or in Carroll Hospital deserve all the recognition they receive, not just for what they do every day, but for going above and beyond in a historic point in time. “I’ve been a nurse over 40 years and never in my wildest dreams thought we would work through something like this,” she said. “I have seen and been so impressed and proud with nursing peers I work with every day. They never cease to amaze me.” Nurses like Amy Dinaburg, who works in Carroll Hospital’s emergency department. She’s been a nurse for 10 years. “My first career was, I was a scientist, I had a masters in molecular biology, and I discovered I am not a cubicle, lab person,” Dinaburg said. “I love people, I love to be on my feet, running around. I love biology and I love to help and nursing just seems to fit that perfectly.” Coming from a psychiatric nursing background, Dinaburg began cross-training for the emergency department and found emergency medicine was really the best fit for her personality. Carroll Hospital Critical Care Unit Nurse Nancy Yocum, meanwhile, knew nursing was the career for her ever since she worked in a hospital cleaning instruments during high school. “I just thought it would be a really neat experience to work in the hospital helping people,” she said. “I have been a nurse for 43 years,” about 29 of those spent at Carroll Hospital. But with COVID-19, both nurses have had to adapt to a new reality, primarily in terms of wearing protective gear and adapting to the always changing protocols designed to keep patients and health care workers safe. “It’s labor intensive to get prepared to go into a room, and then be able to stay in the room with all your gear on, and communication is challenged, too,” Yocum said. “Sometimes the patients can’t understand you through all your protective equipment.” “You look like you’re an astronaut,” Reid added. “It takes a little bit away from our patient one-to-one.” But that doesn’t mean patients haven’t been able to communicate about the help they are receiving. Yocum noted, whether it’s while they are in the hospital, or once they are out, along with general support and recognition from the surrounding community. “I would say the appreciation is more visible everywhere of late. The community has been super in sending meals, sending cards,” Yocum said. “Little gifts of encouragement from people. Lots of things to sustain us and encourage our spirit to press on.” There have been all kinds of meals, from pizza to chicken sandwiches, delivered for hospital staff, according to Dinaburg, though she said the best gift anyone could give them is to help flatten the curve with regards to COVID-19. “We’ve gotten so many donations and it’s lovely, it feels really good to be appreciated," Dinaburg said. “But for the most part what we really need is people to stay safe and stay healthy.” At the same time, however, Dinaburg stressed that the emergency department is going to great lengths to keep potential COVID-19 patients and those with unrelated medical emergencies separates, and that people shouldn’t stay away from the hospital if they need help. “We take a lot of precautions to keep everybody safe — don’t wait for your appendix to burst to come to the ER,” she said. “But also you may want to contact your primary care doctor and consult with them about whether your visit is necessary.” And so at a time when nurses are receiving so much support, but also facing the biggest challenges of their careers, Yocum said her message to those interested in joining the profession is clear. “We need more nurses. Our nursing shortage is still present and we just need to encourage more young people to come into the field,” she said. It is, just simply an incredible time to be a nurse, Reid said, with the mission of care giving never more in demand, and the challenges revealing the deep character of all those in the field. “It’s draining, it’s hard, it really is a rough time. But they plug away, which is so incredible to me,” she said. “It’s easy to be a nurse when things are routine, but when it’s difficult, that’s where the rubber meets the road. It’s what you were always trained for.”

Havre de Grace ‘hanging in there’ with current funds during coronavirus pandemic, will keep property tax, utility rates the same for fiscal 2021
.W
Havre de Grace city leaders are “holding the line” and keeping property tax and water and sewer rates the same going into fiscal 2021, according to Mayor William T. Martin, although officials are being very strict with their spending now and leaving room for adjustments in next year’s budget, depending on the economic impact from the coronavirus pandemic. “I don’t really think anybody knows what the financial outlook is going to be, although we’re very confident, as a city, that we’re in good shape,” Martin said during a City Council meeting Monday. Council members voted 5-0 Monday to introduce Ordinance 1033, setting property tax rates, and Ordinance 1034 setting water and sewer rates for the 2021 fiscal year, which begins July 1. Councilman David Martin was absent as he was fighting pneumonia, according to Council President David Glenn. Ordinance 1033 sets tax rates at 56.5 cents per $100 in valuation of real property, $1.705 for personal property, plus 4.4 cents on top of the standard real property rate for properties in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Taxing District near the shoreline. The base rate for water will stay the same at $6.20 per 1,000 gallons, and the sewer rate will remain at $9.30 per 1,000 gallons. Capital cost recovery fees, charged to developers to connect to the municipal water and sewer system, will be $5,300 per residential unit for water and $13,200 per unit for sewer, according to Ordinance 1034. The ordinance also establishes a $30 quarterly service charge for the city’s Infrastructure Reinvestment Program, meant to raise money for debt service on fund borrowed to repair aging water and sewer infrastructure. City voters approved a $15 million bond measure during a special election in February to support infrastructure repairs and new projects. The city is working to take part in the Maryland Department of Housing and Economic Development’s next Local Government Infrastructure Program bond issuance, which is expected to happen in late May or early June, according to Steve Gamatoria, the mayor’s chief of staff. The city held the special election in February with the goal of going to the bond markets this spring — pending voter approval. Gamatoria noted, in an email Monday, that “the bond market has been tumultuous since the social and economic lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.” “Recent news by [Harford] County, however, signals that financial markets are reopening to government bonds,” Gamatoria added. “Further optimism is being fueled by the focus of the federal government on infrastructure programs, but there has been no specifics to-date.” The council is scheduled to vote on adopting the rate ordinances during its next meeting May 18. A public hearing was held Monday after the ordinances were introduced, but no one was present to speak. The mayor encouraged people to contact City Hall at 410-939-1800 or a City Council member over the next two weeks to give their input on the rates, or they can submit comments in writing to be read into the record at the next meeting. People also can give public comments in person during the meeting, although they must adhere to social distancing guidelines. The council also is scheduled to hold a public work session on the budget May 26, starting at 6 p.m. The meeting will be livestreamed, according to Glenn. All council meetings have been broadcast over the internet since April 20. City financial picture Councilman Jason Robertson asked if the property tax rates can be reassessed “at a future date,” since the full scope of COVID-19′s impact on the economy is still unknown. Millions of Americans have been unemployed and businesses have shut down in recent weeks as events small and large have been canceled. Many states — including Maryland — have ordered non-essential businesses to close and enacted strict stay-at-home orders. The mayor submitted his proposed budget to the council in March and proposed that tax and utility rates remain the same next year. “The current budget that you have is based on this tax rate [in the ordinance], so if you were to amend it then we would, by necessity, have to amend the revenues in the current budget,” Finance Director George DeHority said in response to Robertson’s question. Revenues could be adjusted in the separate budget ordinance, scheduled to come out in June, DeHority noted. “It’s probably going to impact 2022’s budget much more than 2021,” Robertson said of the unemployment picture. Martin stressed that the council can keep the tax rate the same, or raise or lower it. He said the budget submitted in March is “a fiscally sound budget.” “I also feel, should revenues not come in as quickly as we need, there is room for attrition in that budget,” the mayor added. Capital projects can be delayed if needed. The city is currently “in good financial shape,” but it does have a rainy day fund of about $1.3 million “that we have not even come close to hitting yet,” Martin said. The mayor issued a directive to his department heads two weeks ago that they cease non-essential spending and “concentrate our spending on necessary purchases that involve day-to-day operations and personnel.” “We just want to make sure that, wherever this COVID-19 pandemic takes us, that the City of Havre de Grace will be prepared and that our number one priority is, and always will be, to provide services to our citizens every single day,” he said. Those services include police, fire and EMS protection, water and sewer service and infrastructure maintenance. “Right now, we’re hanging in there,” Martin said. “We’re doing OK right now — knock on wood — but it’s very tough to see into the future, so we’re being very cautious with things.”

Community Voices (Pyatt): With little ability to test from the outset, US still playing catch-up on coronavirus
.W
The lack of COVID-19 testing kits — which will eventually be debated at length as to whether it was avoidable and whose fault it was — and the shortage of other medical equipment necessary to fight this current pandemic has led to some novel approaches to “flatten the curve” and hopefully to work our way through this mess. This includes our newly acquired “social distancing” skills. This is akin to starting the Super Bowl and giving the opponent several touchdowns. The United States never had a chance. We’re still playing catch-up, and it’s still in the second quarter. Luckily, Gov. Hogan was chair of the Governors’ Association — and in my opinion this was a Godsend for us and may save the state from the worst-case heard of early outbreaks in Washington and California — and took quick and decisive action. Lack of or insufficient testing kit availability — as quoted by the nursing home administrator in the media — likely will be the primary lesson learned from the Pleasant View Nursing Home outbreak on or about March 28th in which at least 81 patients contracted COVID-19 and causing 17 deaths through Tuesday night. At the same time, 31 staff members have tested positive, and it seems incomprehensible that all were asymptomatic. Staff are the guardians of COVID-19 entry. As we evolve into this scenario of “do I have it/don’t I have it” because of very strict criteria for allowing — or not allowing — tests, I recently listened to a radio chat on National Public Radio on this topic. Very soon, folks will need some clarification of whether they either had it at one time or don’t have it or could develop in the future if we’re going to emerge from this financial slowdown. I’ll call them the “Dunnos!” Only about 3% of Maryland’s residents have been tested. So far — fortunately — the vast majority of tests were negative. Again, it’s not the fault of local medical folks. They’re trying. And I believe the situation is slowly improving. Only if you are sick enough to require hospitalization because you have had quite serious breathing issues and — if determined; oxygen sensors are now also in short supply — low blood oxygen levels, will you know the answer. Even then there are false readings. And this comes amid myriad similar symptoms from flu and allergies. So it’s possible all Pleasant View staff members, most with considerable medical training, were faked out. Probably the large majority (say 90% or so) will continue to stumble along for months or even longer not knowing the answer yet not sure they can rejoin the “rat race,” e.g. their jobs. According to a recent survey done by the University of Chicago and reported in a Washington Post opinion article, slightly reworded here, 80% of economists believed that restoring public trust in our public health system and maintaining our social distance policy was more important than an immediate return to employment, particularly when there is a high chance of a recurrence. They want to be sure folks are going to remain healthy. They appreciate that sick workers are not productive. But we haven’t come to terms with those who either think they’re susceptible or just aren’t sure. Not knowing may be just as bad as testing positive. The health care system is in a duct-taped “first responder” mode. The covid19.healthdata.com website — the basis for the March 31 presidential brief — showed a shortage of 1,310 hospital beds, 532 ICU beds and 638 ventilators coming in May for Maryland. Hogan appears to be aware of this, but Superman can only do so much. Lack of bipartisan agreement on fundamental COVID-19 response and national wavering on leadership, e.g. lack of a coherent short-term, mid-term and long-term game plan, will soon have an impact locally. In less than a few weeks. We will soon be promised cures and magic serums and the “availability” of new and wonderful ventilators just like we have repeatedly been misinformed about the availability of tests in the past yet receiving assurances of “wonderful” new tests coming. Most of these won’t pan out. But that’s not a strategy. Established industries will have their struggles, but telecommuting, online chats, and e-trade will eventually re-emerge stronger than ever. There is an opening or opportunity — perhaps more of a necessity — to rethink how humans do commerce and preserve public health concerns The team of virologists, physicians and bio-statisticians assembled to address this and future threats — from both federal agencies and two top-ranked public health programs at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland is truly amazing. We need to listen. Dave Pyatt writes from Mount Airy. Email him at Dpyatt2@verizon.net.

Letters: Trump more concerned about market than coronavirus itself; More important than ever to complete the census; Kudos to Westminster mayor, council
.W
Trump more concerned about market than coronavirus itself Concerns about the coronavirus escalated fast. We were going about our normal lives, and now, COVID-19 has led to the closings of schools, businesses, and sporting events across the United States. It is nothing the world has experienced before. The only event remotely similar was the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, but during that time, we did not have commercial airliners, a multitude of cruise ships, and the like, making the spread significantly slower. Gov. Hogan addressed the pandemic quickly, closing all schools and banning gatherings. We’re lucky to have a proactive governor. Other states are suffering due to the lack of a proactive federal or state government. . Every other country used a coronavirus test developed by the Germans. However, President Trump and the U.S. government decided to make their own test through the CDC, which initially failed. If the U.S. had simply accepted the German test, the virus would not be spreading so fast. The biggest threat is that many younger people who have the virus exhibit symptoms so minor they don’t believe they have it and don’t get tested. Trump’s philosophy that only those with severe symptoms or risk should be tested is flawed, because many are likely spreading it to those in high-risk groups and don’t even know it. According to recent statistics from mid March, South Korea was testing as many people per day as the United States had tested overall. Trump was concerned if the numbers of people who have coronavirus go up, the stock market would crash and his reelection would be threatened. Maryland has more resources than other states to contain this virus. We have more hospital capacity than most states. However, the lack of decisive action by our federal government has placed immense responsibility into local hands. Hogan’s lieutenant governor is basically doing Hogan’s job because Hogan is investing so much time addressing the coronavirus. If our president does not have the ability to think on his feet in difficult situations, he needs to develop it, fast. The U.S. has a worse situation regarding coronavirus than many less-fortunate countries because of Trump’s inability to set his priorities straight. On Feb. 27, Trump literally said, ”The risk to the American people remains very low.” Trump seems more concerned about the stock market than the virus itself. His inaction could cause our loved ones, especially our grandparents, to get the virus and die, which would not have happened if Trump had begun testing as soon as the German test was developed. We need a president who values our lives over our stock market. We need to advocate for our needs in the next election, and vote in a president who cares about us, opposed to money and selfish interests. Jacquelyn Slade Hampstead More important than ever to complete the census Understandably, with the current COVID 19 dominating the news and everyone’s thoughts, the census is being pushed to the back burner. Our hope, is that while you are working remotely, or have a few moments when you are not dealing with the crisis of the day, you take a few minutes and complete the census. Although this is an unprecedented situation, our guess is that information from the previous census is being used to appropriate vital resources. Everyone is worried about their health, their job, public safety, and our communities’ capacity to care for people that get sick, now think about the $18,500 over 10 years that we won’t receive if you don’t complete the census. An $18,500 return for 10 minutes of your time seems like a great investment. Go to my2020census.gov now. Laura Russell, Census Coordinator Lynda Eisenberg, Director of Planning Don Rowe, Chair, Complete Count Committee Kudos to Westminster mayor, council I would like to thank Westminster Mayor Joe Dominick for his tireless work to keep our city safe during this time. I think he got one night’s sleep in a week. City Councilman Kevin Dayhoff and Councilwoman Ann Thomas Gilbert have kept us up to date on Facebook and are important decision makers. I know City Council President Gregory Pecoraro and councilmen Ben Yingling and Tony Chiavacci and the others have been included in important meetings and hard decisions to keep the City of Westminster running. Although we may not always agree with every decision they make, they are our friends and neighbors and spend untold hours all year to make our city great. Thank them. Next time there is an election, make your vote count. These folks are important to our lives. Lyndi McNulty Westminster

Some Carroll County farmers markets postponing start dates due to coronavirus pandemic
.W
Spring is commonly the start of the farmers market season but some in Carroll County won’t be holding theirs until closer to summer, if then, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The seasonal farmers markets are traditionally a place to get fresh produce, shop from local businesses and connect with members of the community, but restrictions aimed at mitigating the spread of coronavirus, is having an impact. Mount Airy Mount Airy Main Street farmers market is annually the first of the weekly farmers markets in Carroll County, but Mount Airy has postponed from May 13 to a tentative June 3 start, still continuing until Sept. 30. Instead of running for 21 weeks, it would run for 18 weeks at 3 North Main Street. Many changes are planned for the market that is usually an event to bring Mount Airy residents together on Wednesdays. The market will have only eight vendors, no hot food distributed, social distancing markers and customers will have to pre-order and pick-up from vendors at the market. Vendors will be required to wear gloves and patrons will have to wear a face masks. According to Alice Settle-Raskin, Mount Airy Farmers Market master, she decided to make changes to the farmers market in March as news of the pandemic developed. Settle-Raskin will be sending a weekly newsletter of what’s available for pre-orders from vendors. They will also be calling for volunteers soon to run products to patrons and a gatekeeper. The market will have two side and there will only be 10 patrons allowed on each side at a time. Even though the market is scheduled for June 3, that could change if the COVID-19 pandemic continues Settle-Raskin said. Sykesville Sykesville’s farmers market was scheduled to begin May 17 and run through Oct. 26, but its start has been postponed until June 21. No end date has been set. The market will be held at Baldwin Drive (in front of Baldwin Station). According to Julie Della-Maria, executive director of the Downtown Sykesville Connection, they are trying to find the best and safest way to hold their market, either virtually or with some kind drive-true because they don’t have enough space to abide social distancing between vendors. Carroll County The Carroll County farmers market had to cancel two of their three spring markets at the Carroll County Agriculture Center — the Spring Fling market that was scheduled for March and their Easter Show in April — but are hoping to have their Mother’s Day Show, according to Heather Kuykendall, Carroll County farmers market manager. Their summer markets are still scheduled from June 13 through Sept. 5 at 700 Ag Center Drive, Westminster. The coronavirus pandemic has affected how the market will operate and the number of vendors. According to Kuykendall, they will abide by state-mandated guidelines to be safe during the pandemic but will also wipe down tabletops, have everyone wearing masks, have vendors at a distance and markings six feet apart on the ground to follow social distancing. They will only have 10 vendors this year compared to the usual 50 to 75 they usually have because some places are nonessential and others are operated by those with compromised immune systems that don’t feel safe to participate at this time, according to Kuykendall. Downtown Westminster The Downtown Westminster farmers market didn’t postpone their market and still plans on opening May 16 and running each Saturday through Nov. 21 at 27 Railroad Ave. Downtown Westminster will also adapt to different procedures this year due to the pandemic. Shoppers must wear facial masks and they are not allowed to touch products at the market. Customers are also encouraged not to bring their own bags but if they do, vendors will not touch them and just place the items in their bags. Customers are also encouraged to use smaller bills if they use cash but cards and vouchers from vendors are also accepted, according to Brooke Hagerty, Downtwon Westminster farmers market manager. Hampstead The Hampstead farmers market is still scheduled to be begin on June 6, its original date, from 8:30 a.m. to noon, at 1341 N. Main Street. According to Keith Johnson, acting manager of the market, patrons will be allowed to pre-order and pick up. There are no walk-up sales to be done and if people only have cash, there will be a separate person who handles cash or transactions for pre-orders. Everything will be prepackaged for pre-orders. Taneytown The Taneytown farmers market will begin on May 30, according to their Facebook page. The market will be held at 501 E Baltimore St.

Nursing home representative: We are taking precautions to prevent spread of coronavirus, but face major challenges | COMMENTARY
.W
Our war against the COVID-19 pandemic will likely end with an armistice. For health care workers on the front lines the cessation of hostilities will be welcome and come just in time. But news from the front right now is that the war is not over. Here in Maryland and in other communities across the nation, courageous health care teams in hospitals and skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers are fighting to save lives. The care teams don’t like to be called warriors, but they are. COVID-19 is a wicked and deadly virus, and unbelievably contagious. People of all ages with preexisting chronic conditions such as heart and lung disease, diabetes and other immune disorders are more at risk of hospitalization. And older people with such conditions are more likely to die from the virus. One of the saddest storylines of this global pandemic is that it will perpetuate the narrative that people in this country go to hospitals to be saved, and to nursing homes to die. I want people to know that their family, friends and neighbors who work in skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers are showing up every day and working in very challenging conditions to save lives. Truth is, many of the people who work in nursing homes have preexisting conditions themselves that put them at risk to die from the virus. And people should know that those of us who work on behalf of the residents, patients, care teams and operators of nursing homes and the sector have been fighting since February to prepare them for this war, and behind the scenes we have been asking federal and state leaders to help us to prepare. Our war against COVID-19 started as a defensive one. Here in Maryland before government orders, nursing homes worked to limit the visits of vendors and families, screen all visitors, review infectious disease protocols and to overcommunicate with workers, families, residents and patients. Some nursing homes did better than others. But let’s be clear about a small but critical point: When we advised nursing homes to limit visits in advance of a government order, we were advising them to break the law, which limited such restrictions. But taking that step ahead of government orders was critical to slow the entry of COVID-19 into nursing homes. In mid-March, about a month after the devastating tragedy of COVID-19 in nursing homes in Kirkland, Washington, the nursing home COVID-19 surge began here in Maryland. We had a single nursing home case on March 15, and a major outbreak in a single nursing home on March 29. Today we estimate over 130 nursing home, assisted living and senior house centers in Maryland with at least a single worker, resident, or patient who is COVID-19 positive. Most COVID-19 cases in nursing homes in Maryland are not major outbreaks, and that is important to note. Centers prepared with observation and isolation units to separate COVID patients from others. Given the nature of COVID-19, and who is most clinically at risk, it must be pointed out that the war of attrition we are now fighting in nursing homes and across all health care settings was inevitable. But it didn’t have to be this hard. Absent massive national testing targeting health care workers and those clinically most at risk and government stay at home orders in January and February, we’ve been fighting this war with one hand tied behind our backs. When we finally progress to the armistice of this fight, we will all examine and fix the long-term systemic government policies, the short-term government orders, the private sector response and health care lessons of the COVID-19 health pandemic which has been the economic world war of our generation. Already there are questions and potential lessons to learn from. The United States has arguably the best national intelligence capacity in the world, and most of our nation’s personal protective equipment is manufactured in China. So why didn’t we see the protective gear crunch coming? What was and is the cause of our lack of testing? Even today in nursing homes in Maryland, adequate testing is still a problem. COVID-19 has focused a bright light on the chronic underfunding of the part of Medicaid that pays for the majority of nursing home care in our country. If we spend wisely on Medicaid for nursing homes our system can avoid higher costs in hospitals and head off the torrent of patients before they reach our hospitals. It is clear in retrospect that not much thought was put into the planning of this war on the long-term care front. COVID-19 has also shone a bright light on the health care disparities of people receiving and providing care, especially true in communities of color and economically disadvantaged communities. This a national shame. Finally, our war to beat COVID-19 is coming at a huge economic cost. Given government spending and the lack of revenue from economic activity, government budgets coming out of this war will be in rough shape. Much more so than even with the 2008 Great Recession. This will be especially true for state government budgets. And the bottom line is obvious: We must prepare better for the future. Joseph DeMattos Jr. (jdemattos@hfam.org) is president of Health Facilities Association of Maryland, Maryland’s oldest and largest nationally affiliated association representing skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers in Maryland.

Facing ‘really unprecedented times,’ Carroll County school officials detail plans for closure amid coronavirus
.W
Carroll County Public Schools officials learned that the system’s schools would be closing down for two weeks at the same time the rest of the state found out from an address by Gov. Larry Hogan after 4 p.m. Thursday. Although many details are still uncertain at this stage, the school system has been putting plans in place in anticipation of such a closure. Officials outlined those plans to the Times Thursday night. State officials announced Thursday afternoon that public schools would close for two weeks beginning Monday, keeping about 1 million children across Maryland home from school in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus and the COVID-19 disease it causes and to save lives, Hogan said. Superintendent Steve Lockard joined a 5 p.m. conference call with Maryland Superintendent Karen Salmon and superintendents from the other state school districts. CCPS began reaching out to families and employees in the same ways they would for a severe weather event: through phone calls, text messages, emails and posting on carrollk12.org and the official CCPS Facebook page. “We will be communicating frequently over the course of the next two weeks,” Lockard said in an interview. “We’re going to be sharing additional information starting tomorrow, and throughout the period of closure.” The first Carroll County case of the coronavirus was announced Friday afternoon. As of Thursday afternoon, the coronavirus had resulted in 40 deaths in the United States out of almost 1,600 people who have tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. The World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic Wednesday. On Friday, students will be given academic materials to review while schools are closed, though officials specified that these will not served as a direct substitute for curricula. Anticipating a possible closure, system officials began working more than a week ago to prepare online materials through Google Classroom and Microsoft 365, alongside more traditional materials for students who have less access to devices or internet. “It really comes down to that, in some areas, as we get into more sophisticated content in our high schools, you know, we can’t expect kids to be learning without having proper instruction,” said Jason Anderson, chief academic, equity and accountability officer. “It’s more around maintenance at this time, rather than introducing new concepts.” Lockard said, “As we think about the educational opportunities for students over the next couple of weeks, our schools are prepared to provide that to our students [Friday], and also to avail that to our parents and families.” For CCPS staff during the closure, it is being treated in practice like a severe weather event, said John O’Neal, chief operating officer for CCPS. Instructional staff and 10-month employees who serve when students are there will also not work. In weather events, it’s expected that the days will ultimately be made up for. “Other staff would work accordingly, and essential personnel know what to do,” O’Neal said. “Those are most especially the folks who would be cleaning the buildings anyway.” If the closure stretches past two weeks, school officials will regroup and decide what to do going forward. “We’re very much wanting to support any efforts to stem or stop the spread,” Lockard said. “So we’re going to do our part. But we’re also looking forward to getting back to — probably like everybody else — getting back to normalcy. ... We appreciate everybody’s patience and understanding as we kind of go through what are really unprecedented times here.” Individual school principals made the decision to cancel some school events Thursday night on the basis that they went against the state directive to avoid large gatherings of people. After dismissal Friday, there will be no after-school activities, either school sponsored or those held on school property by outside groups, Chief of Schools Cindy McCabe said. While the schools are shut down statewide, each individual system is working on a plan to provide meals to students who rely on the Free and Reduced Meals program, with guidance from the state. For CCPS, this means building on the structure of an existing service for summer meals. O’Neal said the state is giving guidance to school systems, and they expect the state will work out reimbursements and some waivers. “That’s something we’ve been thinking about anyway and working towards planning and having ready,” O’Neal said Thursday evening. They hope to have more specific details Friday. During the closure, buses and CCPS buildings will be cleaned and disinfected. CCPS officials were beginning work on a schedule for staff Thursday night. O’Neal said, “Not having the schools in session allows us to utilize our maintenance and operations team more effectively to get through all the schools in a more thorough way.” CCPS officials have been talking with the system’s bus contractors over the past several days already, “sharing appropriate information with them and making sure they’re up to speed on cleaning and disinfecting buses,” O’Neal said. “If we get additional or different guidance, we’ll make sure that’s shared with them and very clear,” he added. Thursday’s school closure announcement was made in a week when colleges, senior centers and other gathering places have closed in attempts to prevent spread of COVID-19. Maryland officials announced on Thursday the first case of the coronavirus contracted through community spread. This means the disease was spread to the patient through the local community rather than from traveling outside the country or state. In some cases, this means that the disease is spreading among community members undetected by testing. The full text of the school system’s message to staff and families is below: Under the direction of State Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon, all Maryland public schools, including Carroll County Public Schools, will be closed beginning Monday, March 16, through Friday, March 27. Schools will re-open on Monday, March 30. All CCPS and non-CCPS sponsored activities in our school facilities will be canceled This action is being taken in all Maryland public school systems as a preventative measure to contain the spread of the coronavirus and out of an abundance of caution. The safety and well-being of students and staff continue to be our top priority. We will be sharing additional information with you tomorrow and throughout this period of closure. In the meantime, we encourage you to review the information and tips on our website for keeping you and your family healthy. And, we can’t stress enough the importance of practicing the preventive measures we have outlined in previous communications. These measures can also be found on our website. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we work through this challenging time.

Letters: Column insulting to Biden, the anti-Trump; Look around anti-Trumpers, America is great again; Social programs in danger after coronavirus crisis
.W
Column insulting to Biden, the anti-Trump Could columnist M.K. Sprinkle (“Democrats’ exploitation of Joe Biden a cruel and shameful means to an end,” March 14) possibly be any more condescending? Poor old Joe Biden, so obviously suffering from dementia, and those cruel Democrats ignoring the obvious and using him to try to gain power. Please. That is demeaning to both Joe Biden and to those of us who support him. Setting aside the issue of President Trump’s own gaffes (covfefe anyone?) and lapses in knowledge and memory, we who support Biden know exactly who we’re supporting and why. He is the anti-Trump. Where Trump is rude, obnoxious, and insulting, Biden is kind, polite, and respectful. Where Trump believes he only has to rely on himself to find all the answers to cure the world’s problems, Biden knows that effective leadership requires forming coalitions of knowledgeable and experienced people. Where Trump only cares about serving his base, Biden is prepared to reach across the aisle and seek common ground. Where Trump has experience in property development, Biden has long experience in government. Where Trump has no empathy, lies easily, and surrounds himself with yes-men, Biden is honest, compassionate, decent, and knows he is not God. Need I go on? It’s important to remember that Biden had a serious stutter when he was young, but he worked hard and overcame it. Sometimes it shows up a little when he’s stressed. It’s also important to know that sometimes us older folk do have memory lapses, especially under pressure. That doesn’t mean we have dementia or that we’re not competent to handle complex tasks. Right now, with the coronavirus pandemic raging, it would be so good to have a leader at the helm who is kind, empathetic, steady, competent, and a coalition builder. Instead we have a president who is a master at denial, divisiveness, lying, and blaming. Who would you rather have leading our country in a crisis? Judy Hake Union Bridge Look around anti-Trumpers, America is great again Columnist Tom Zirpoli and letter-writer David Iacono, you have my deepest sympathy. The anti-Trump virus you both have attracted is very painful. Unlike the coronavirus, which can be cured, your symptoms are guaranteed to last four more years while we continue to Make America Great Again. It will take four more years because of the Obama and Clinton fiasco. The discord they caused in eight years, in setting our nation back, becoming the laughingstock of the world. They all took advantage of our great country, i.e., China, Iran, NATO, and the list goes on. Obama bowed down to foreign kings and rulers and made a tour overseas apologizing for American behavior. He was the star of Hollywood, the elite, the media and the misguided. Then along cam Trump. The man of the people. The MAGA caps, the rallies, the hope for the Walmart people, the gun owners, the real people of America. Everywhere I go, Trump is No. 1. In closing, all I can suggest for your anti-Trump virus is to wake up and smell the roses, look around, America is great again. Harry Griffith Hampstead Social programs in danger after coronavirus crisis Regarding the coronavirus crisis, it is a shame that the buck does not stop with the president and his administration. Everyone else is at fault. We must give the nurses, aides and doctors a big thank-you. As vice president of the American Federation State County Municipal Employees Retirees Chapter 1, I can see after the crisis, the social programs will take a big hit. But you can be, not one penny from his wall. William Stevens Keymar

University System of Maryland moves all undergraduate learning online for rest of semester because of the coronavirus
.W
The chancellor of the University of Maryland System said Thursday night that all undergraduate classes will switch to online instruction for the rest of the semester, though a decision about graduate classes has not been made. Chancellor Jay A. Perman told the board of regents that the presidents of each of the 12 campuses in the system would work out the details for their students, but he said their decision to turn to online was unanimous. Many of the campuses had already begun to plan for going online. There are 177,000 students in the university system. Gov. Larry Hogan had announced at a morning news conference that he was suggesting to the board of regents and Perman that universities move to distance learning, so the board’s action was expected. “I believe this is important not only for our institutions but for our students themselves, who should be assured that they did the work — and successfully demonstrated the knowledge and skills — that their courses required,” he said. Perman said universities will need to look at the graduate programs more closely before a decision is made. “In terms of graduate students and students in professional programs, we have a different set of considerations. We’re working through those considerations now, and we’ll certainly need guidance from the relevant accrediting bodies and boards that provide certification,” Perman said. The system also announced a number of important decisions for families and students. All graduation ceremonies this spring are canceled and Perman said he encourages students and faculty to find creative ways to celebrate without being together physically. He said he would encourage in-person commencements once the health emergency is over. The universities will refund the cost of room and board on a prorated basis. If students took out financial aid to pay for room and board, Perman said, the federal government has assured the university that students will not have their money “clawed back.” Deposits for the fall semester are due May 1, but that deadline will be pushed back. Students who do not have access to a laptop or internet at home will be given both, Perman said, without offering details. The restrictions will also affect research at Maryland’s many universities. Perman said the system will be “advising that laboratories ramp down their research significantly and continue only those research activities currently in a critical phase, meaning that abandoning them would cause a major or irreversible loss in project viability.” In a message to UMBC students on Thursday night, the school’s president, Freeman Hrabowski III, and its provost, Philip Rous, acknowledged student concerns. “We know you have been concerned with what happens next, and we are all feeling for you and with you,” the message said. “There is so much you hoped to do this semester, and it is such a disappointment to have these plans interrupted.” The board of regents also voted to give Perman temporary authority to change the university policies because of the pandemic. Leaders of individual campuses are expected to send information to their communities. Morgan State University, Johns Hopkins University and some others have already announced that their students will not be returning to campus this semester. Perman warned students to take the rest of the semester seriously. “This isn’t a break. It’s not a respite from the semester. It’s not a party. I urge students staying in their family homes or in off-campus housing to follow the state and federal guidelines on gatherings,” he said, noting scenes from spring break partying that has been going on in Florida this week.

Maryland jails are incubators for the coronavirus and precautions must be taken to avoid an outbreak, experts say
.W
Schools, colleges and government agencies nationwide are taking preemptive measures against the spread of the COVID-19 virus, with doctors warning people to avoid close contact and not gather in large groups. But one population is particularly vulnerable because they can’t do that. Inmates at Maryland’s jails and prisons are stuck in incubators that become prime space for the rapid spread of the virus, experts said. And so far, measures taken by Maryland are not enough to protect the inmate population in case the virus strikes, health experts and advocates for inmates said. The Maryland correctional department said no cases have been reported in the state’s jails and prisons, although a spokesman for the department said he has no information that any inmate has been tested. Thursday afternoon, Gov. Larry Hogan did institute a big change, ordering that all visits to state prisons be stopped immediately. Earlier Thursday, the state’s department of corrections said it hadn’t taken measures outside of actively educating its staff, inmates and visitors about taking proper precautions. That includes washing hands thoroughly, using hand sanitizers, and avoiding contact with sick people, according to department spokesman Mark Vernarelli. Nazgol Ghandnoosh, senior research analyst with the Sentencing Project, a Washington D.C. based research and advocacy center, said inmates in prison and jail settings are particularly at risk because of the constant flow of new inmates, guards coming in from the outside and people coming to the facilities to visit inmates. She said the suggestions for more washing and cleanliness provided by MDOC are similar to those offered by prisons nationwide. “It is sort of along the lines of what I have seen in other correctional institutions. They are transferring over plans that they had previously established for the flu," Ghandnoosh said in an interview. “In a place like Maryland where we know there are a lot of obstacles in place for older people to release from prison, this is a way to find a way around that." She said elderly inmates who may not pose any real threat to society should be released with home monitoring whenever possible during an outbreak such as this one. There have been a total of 12 cases reported in Maryland. Health officials report they have tested 94 people for COVID-19, which the World Health Orgranization deemed a pandemic Wednesday. More cases are expected as the testing ramps up. Dr. Homer Venters, a New York based president of the Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, a group focused on healthcare in jails, said jails and prisons have special risks that other spaces may not have. The threat is particularly acute for elderly patients or those suffering from chronic illness -a common problem in many prisons. “Jails and prisons promote spread. Generally these are filthy, dirty places," Venters said. “One of the simplest tools to combat an outbreak is hand washing. Many people in prisons and jails don’t have access. Many sinks are broken or don’t have soap or paper towels. Often there are no sinks. "Think of intake areas, teeming pens of 30 to 40 to 50 people in a room with a concrete floor that people lie on and no place to wash.” Venters said to combat the problem, facilities need to develop plans if inmates become sick. Venters said correctional facilities “drive up the curve” of more potential virus cases. “If people develop symptoms, they will be housed in isolation. If they are diagnosed they have to go to a third place for quarantine. If they become ill there will have to be taken to the hospital,” Venters said. “This requires the ability to move people around, a difficult process ordinarily and harder when they are infectious.” On Thursday, Human Rights Watch, a New York based research and advocacy organization, said authorities in the United States need to “consider supervised release and other non-custodial alternatives" for detainees who are at high risk of infection, in a press release. The organization says protecting inmates also protects staff from the infection. “People behind bars are often forgotten by society during a crisis, but protecting their health is crucial for protecting overall public health,” said Nicole Austin-Hillery, US Program executive director at Human Rights Watch in a press release. “Protecting people in custody also protects staff and visitors from those facilities who return to their communities each day.” Baltimore Sun Reporter Meredith Cohn contributed to this story.

Maryland Gov. Hogan on the coronavirus: ‘In two weeks around Easter, we are going to be looking more like New York’
.W
Maryland likely will continue to see a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases through Easter, Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday morning, indicating that residents can expect social distancing measures to remain in place through next month. The state health department announced five new deaths Sunday afternoon, bringing Maryland’s total to 15, including the first in Howard County. The number of confirmed cases also continued to mount as the state reported 247 more Sunday, bringing Maryland’s tally to 1,239. And late Sunday, the first case of Baltimore City schools employee was announced. “In two weeks, around Easter, we are going to be looking more like New York,” Hogan said in an interview with Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace. “It’s continuing to grow at really frightening paces, and we think it’s going to be worse in two weeks, not better.” Last week, President Donald Trump said he would like to “have the country opened up” by Easter, which is April 12, but Sunday afternoon, Trump called that goal aspirational. The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government had been set to expire Monday, and Trump had expressed interest in relaxing the national guidelines in parts of the country less afflicted by the pandemic to give the economy a boost. But Sunday he instead said he decided to extend them through April 30. Many states, including Maryland, have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings. Governors like Hogan and medical professionals have indicated that Maryland and other states would see increases in case numbers over the next two weeks, and that distancing measures would need to continue. “I think the virus is going to dictate the time frame," Hogan said. "We’re going to follow advice of the scientists and doctors. We don’t see any way we are going to be opening in a couple of weeks.” Asked about Trump’s contradictory comments before Sunday, Hogan said "the messaging isn’t helpful” as he and other governors are encouraging people to stay home. “I think the president is just trying to be hopeful, which is good," Hogan said. “We don’t want people to be scared, but we want them to take it seriously.” Nonessential businesses and schools in Maryland remain closed, and state officials urge residents to stay home as cases continue to rise. Nonessential businesses and schools in Maryland remain closed, and state officials urge residents to stay home as cases and deaths continue to rise. After reporting a 25% increase in cases Sunday morning, the Maryland Department of Health announced the five new deaths late Sunday afternoon. They include a Carroll County man in his 90s; a Howard County man in his 70s; a Prince George’s County man in his 30s; a Prince George’s County woman in her 50s; and a Prince George’s County man in his 70s. All five had underlying health conditions. Howard County reported it had two deaths Sunday afternoon, including a man in his 90s in addition to the man in his 70s. It’s unclear why its number conflicted with the state’s and neither state nor local officials offered an explanation. The dead Carroll County man was a resident of the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy, where a coronavirus outbreak is ravaging residents. Hogan announced Saturday night that 66 residents of the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy had been infected with the disease. As of Sunday, 17 had been hospitalized and one died. As a result of the outbreak, Carroll County experienced the state’s largest spike in cases, jumping from 10 Saturday to 82 Sunday morning. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties continued to lead the state in confirmed cases. Montgomery County has 46 new cases, bringing its total to 301, while Prince George’s has 51 new cases, bringing that D.C. suburb’s total up to 247, according to the Maryland Department of Health. The two counties account for a little less than half of all coronavirus cases in the state. They were followed by Baltimore County with 169 and Baltimore city with 129 Late Sunday, Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced that a city schools employee had tested positive for COVID-19. He said the employee has not been at school since the school year was suspended on March 16 and has not been distributing learning packets or emergency meals. The school system is cleaning and sanitizing school buildings, following recommended guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said. The state health department’s online dashboard reported that 39 people with confirmed cases have been released from isolation and that 12,534 tests for the disease have come back negative. Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, also was interviewed on the Fox News Sunday program and asked when social distancing measures should be eased. “If we go back to work too quickly, this epidemic is going to spread widely and aggressively, and we won’t have a normal economy in that case anyway," Inglesby said. He said a decision to lift measures should be made after evaluating several conditions, such as once a state or region sees numbers on the decline. He said testing, supplies such as adequate masks for medical staff, hospital preparation for an influx of patients, and the ability to trace contacts of confirmed cases should all be considered before measures are lifted.

University System of Maryland board of regents unanimously votes in favor of partial refunds of student fees in the wake of coronavirus safety measures
.W
A week after the University System of Maryland announced that its 12 universities will finish their spring semesters online, the system’s board of regents voted unanimously to allow its chancellor to approve plans for partial refunds of various student fees. On a conference call Thursday afternoon, Chancellor Jay Perman said the plan had the support of all the system’s university presidents as they work to help students and families amid the nationwide shutdowns caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “I have regular conversations each week with all 12 university presidents and their executive cabinets,” Perman said. "One of the foremost topics during these conversations has been the partial refund of student fees, including the cost associated with room and board. “The presidents have expressed throughout these deliberations that they have a responsibility to their students and families, a responsibility to support them through this difficult time when their physical and financial healths are in jeopardy," Perman continued. "There’s agreements among the presidents, therefore, that we should refund a portion of these student fees.” Perman said he and the presidents “want to make more specific decisions around these refunds very soon," with a statement from the University System of Maryland after the call saying the individual campuses will make announcements about their respective refund processes shortly after a public announcement from the system. In addition to room and board, prorated refunds for parking and athletics fees were mentioned specifically when board Chair Linda Gooden presented the motion for a vote, which was unanimously in favor with no abstentions. The university system had an operating budget of $5.8 billion in the 2019 fiscal year, and its 12 campuses feature 177,000 students among them. With campuses closing, students are not making use of campuses’ living, dining and parking options. The National Collegiate Athletic Association has also canceled the year’s remaining sporting events, from the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments to all spring championships. Perman said last week that students who took out financial aid to pay for room and board will not have to worry about returning it to the federal government, adding that students who don’t have access to the internet or a computer at home will be provided both. Students and faculty alike are forced to adapt to a distance-learning format, leaving courses that in some cases are intended to include discussion, lab work and group projects to be done online. Commencement ceremonies have been canceled, as well. Although it won’t help students and their families return to a regular school year, Thursday’s board vote likely will alleviate some of the financial stress they’re facing amid the crisis. “As the University System works through the challenges associated with COVID-19, we’re continuing to act aggressively to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff," Gooden said on the call. "I thank Chancellor Perman again for his strong and decisive leadership during this difficult time, and I thank our university presidents, as well, who’ve been judicious in their actions, always putting their students first.”

Maryland is now under a ‘stay-at-home’ order to fight coronavirus. But not much has actually changed. 
.W
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued a statewide “stay at home” order Monday — sounding the alarm for residents to further curtail their daily lives to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. “Every Marylander can be a hero, just by staying home,” Hogan, a Republican, said in a news conference outside the State House in Annapolis. Maryland residents were already under severe restrictions, with schools, colleges, sit-down restaurants, malls, casinos, gyms, theaters and nonessential businesses ordered closed over the past few weeks. And the governor previously had banned gatherings of more than 10 people. Here’s what the order, which goes into effect Monday at 8 p.m., means for state residents. You can only go out for “essential activities." Those are defined as caring for yourself and your household, including pets and livestock. It’s OK to go to the grocery store and to get household supplies “needed to maintain safety, sanitation, and essential maintenance of the home.” You also can go out for health reasons, such as medical treatment and getting medication. While some home improvement and big-box stores remain open, now is not the time for redecorating, Hogan said. “You shouldn’t be out shopping for new carpets or cabinets or go buying furniture or clothing," he said. Shopping trips should be limited to necessary goods and items for urgent repairs, he said. Liquor stores remain open. However, Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci urged people to consider alternatives. “Liquor stores remain open, BUT this is why the governor authorized carryout and delivery of alcohol, to avoid going into the stores as much as possible,” Ricci tweeted. Some people can still go to work. The order allows people to go to work — if it’s at an essential business that’s still open. Last week, Hogan ordered nonessential businesses to close. He asked even essential businesses Monday to “scale down” their operations as much as possible. Owners of nonessential businesses that are closed can go to and from their workplace “for the purpose of engaging in minimal operations,” according to the order. That covers tasks such as maintaining a property, facilitating telecommuting, processing payroll and caring for animals at a business. Stores and businesses that are nonessential can no longer offer curbside pickup of goods. They can offer delivery service, provided they follow health guidelines. Campgrounds must close, with an exception only for people living in recreational vehicles who have no other place to go. It’s OK to go out to exercise, within reason. If you’re going to go out for a walk, run or bike ride, you must comply with social distancing directives to keep at least 6 feet from other people and not to congregate in groups. You should only go out with members of your immediate household. “Only take a walk by yourself or with the people you live with for a very short period of time,” Fran Phillips, the state’s deputy health secretary, said Monday. Hogan said: “You should be able to get outside for your own physical and mental well-being and go for a walk and take your dog for a walk. You should not be going out with a crowd of 100 people congregating in a park somewhere.” The beaches at state parks were closed over the weekend, along with picnic shelters, playgrounds and visitor centers. Baltimore City parks workers removed basketball rims and tennis nets to discourage players. Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman said his county’s parks would remain open for outdoor exercise only. “You can jog, bike, hike, or walk your dog ... but we are closing restrooms, basketball courts & dog parks,” Pittman tweeted Monday. Howard County, which already closed playgrounds at its parks, announced Monday it would close courts for basketball, volleyball, tennis and pickleball, as well as skate parks and disc golf courses. Parents can pick up meals or supplies from schools. The order includes a provision allowing for travel to schools “for purposes of receiving meals or instructional materials for distance learning.” Maryland has set up hundreds of locations around the state where meals are provided to children. They will remain open. Don’t go on a road trip. Hogan asked Marylanders not to travel out of state unless it is “absolutely necessary.” Anyone who returns to Maryland from another state is asked to self-quarantine at home for two weeks, Hogan said. “We encourage not just businesses, but families and friends, to make every effort to use remote forms of communication to limit person-to-person contact,” he said. It is not illegal, however, to go for a drive. Violating the order is a criminal offense. If you’re caught violating this executive order, you could face penalties of up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine. Maryland State Police and city and county law enforcement officers enforce the orders. Over the weekend, the Charles County Sheriff’s Office charged a man with two counts of violating the order that banned gatherings of more than 10 people, after they had reports he hosted a bonfire with 60 guests. And on Monday, a Lutherville man was charged with hosting a party of 10 teenage guests at a Carroll County hotel.

My father’s funeral is Friday and because of coronavirus, I can’t go. But I will honor him all the same. | COMMENTARY
.W
My father’s funeral is this Friday, but I won’t be there. Just as I wasn’t there with him in the intensive care unit a few weeks ago. Or at the nursing home where he returned to die. I can’t get to Boston in time to attend his funeral. Massachusetts has imposed a 14-day self-quarantine on those entering the state. My father graduated from high school a semester early when he was 17 years old so that he could enlist in the Navy during World War II. He was assigned to the Marines as a Navy corpsman to treat the wounded. He participated in the capture of Iheya Island and then Okinawa, attached to combat team eight, Second Marine Division, in June and July 1945. And on Sept. 24, 1945, he disembarked from the USS Freestone in Nagasaki Harbor, as part of the first group of U.S. troops to enter Nagasaki after the second atomic bomb flattened the city, killed or wounded tens of thousands of Japanese civilians and ended the war. I would later learn that being a Navy corpsman required more than treating wounded American Marines (and Japanese people), it meant picking up body parts and trying to match them with others before putting them in bags to ship home to the U.S. My father rarely spoke about his time in the military while I was growing up. When he did, it was to show me things like how to make a bed or fold a Marine blanket the way they had taught him in boot camp. But as I got older and learned more about the Pacific campaign, I realized that the lesson my father continued to teach was the one he had learned from the Marines: keep going, just keep going. After the war, he was a complicated man who lived a simple life. He was lucky enough to get a job at the Westinghouse Corporation in Boston in a large factory that made industrial fans. A machinist and union member, he eventually became a shipping clerk and shop steward before Westinghouse sold the group to a German company — ending hundreds of high-paying jobs. Not only was my father out of work for the first time in his life, he also lost many of his closest friendships built on the factory floor over decades. But he joined another union and worked part time as a hotel waiter. And he had his bowling league to see some of his old Westinghouse friends. Together, they did what my father and his buddies did during the war: They kept going. Years later, when both my father and his second wife were facing long-term care, I talked him into applying for VA benefits. There were parts of his life, those my sister and I would not forget but tried to look past, that indicated post-traumatic stress disorder. When I took him to be “diagnosed,” the VA contractor interviewing him asked if he had ever been depressed or thought of suicide. By then, my father was in his 80s. He looked at the man silently. Who was he to ask these questions? Who was he to judge my father or his life? After college, I traveled to Asia and then Africa to work with refugees. Some shared how they had left dead or dying relatives behind. Without time or means to bury them, they tried wrapping their bodies or at least their faces in cloth before leaving them by the side of the road or dropped overboard. They didn’t dare: if they went back or delayed, they too could die. So they kept going, they had to keep going. That drive to survive, the duty to do everything you can to live and to make sure that others around you stay healthy and will live, does not erase the sense of failure or even shame from not performing a duty as basic as burying your father. Trying to preserve one’s honor and decency amid fear and death, conflicting duties, defeat and losses, sacrifice, and forced retreats — these were the challenges my father faced as a young man barely out of high school. These conflicts are never resolved satisfactorily, the failure always haunts. My sister, who is immunosuppressed, also can’t be at the funeral on Friday. Instead, she’ll watch the service on her phone, just as I will. And together we’ll do what millions of others will do this year when they cannot say a proper goodbye to their loved ones. We’ll keep going, we’ll all just keep going. Peter Charles Choharis (peter@choharislaw.com) lives in Maryland with his wife and two daughters.

‘People are going to be hungry for a long time’: Maryland food drives seeing spike in demand amid coronavirus job losses 
.W
A long line of cars began to form around 9:30 a.m. Friday, an hour and a half before the food drive at Parkville High School was set to open. Soon it snaked beyond the parking lot, onto Putty Hill Avenue. One by one, drivers pulled up to the curb and popped open their trunks, where volunteers placed bags of non-perishable food, toiletries, sanitary products and other essentials offered by the Student Support Network, state Del. Cathi Forbes and other volunteers. In its Friday food drives at Parkville and Owings Mills high schools in the past six weeks, the Student Support Network has given out tens of thousands of meals to anyone who needs one, said Laurie Taylor-Mitchell, the group’s president and founder. “We’re hoping as donations increase, we’ll be able to open more sites this summer,” she said. “People are going to be hungry for a long time.” The food drive, which operates 11 a.m.-1 p.m. each Friday, is one of a growing number of efforts aimed at feeding the hundreds of thousands of Marylanders who are now unemployed or have seen their hours cut due to the global pandemic. Demand at food drives around the state has doubled over the past month, according to the Maryland Food Bank, which said it distributed 2.2 million pounds of food during the first two weeks of April. The surge in need — combined with a 90% drop in food donations — has forced the Food Bank to purchase $3.6 million of food in the past 30 days, compared with $220,000 in a typical month. The Student Support Network, which started in 2017 at Loch Raven High School, normally stocks school food pantries where low-income students at 10 Baltimore County schools can discreetly pick up food, toiletries and other necessities. But those closed with the schools. About 51,000 Baltimore County students — roughly 44% — already qualify for assistance, “i.e., were in poverty before the pandemic,” Taylor-Mitchell said. “The need is much greater now,” she said. “Once they figure out we’re here every Friday, [the line] will be like that all the time.” In previous weeks, the Parkville food drive received donations from the Maryland Food Bank, including a 9,600-pound delivery last week. But the state’s top nonprofit hunger-relief organization is stretched thin, and the Parkville volunteers were worried they would run out this week. So Forbes, a Towson Democrat, put out a request for canned goods on her Facebook page. Just over 24 hours later, her porch was overflowing with about 3,000 donated cans of soup, vegetables and other non-perishables dropped off by neighbors and constituents from across her district, she said. “The most important thing we can do is to feed people,” Forbes said. “If people aren’t sick and haven’t lost their jobs, they want to help in any way they can.” Charvae Moore has been calling the state unemployment line every day for weeks withoute luck reaching a person who can help her. The 21-year-old, who worked at a now-closed Dave & Busters, picked up food Friday at Parkville High for herself and her parents, brother, godsister and godsister’s daughter, who all live together in Pine Grove. “The only thing keeping me sane is my faith and realizing that nothing lasts forever,” Moore said. The food giveaways are critical for the many families going without paychecks who have children to feed, she said. “There’s a need for it,” Moore said. “If they stopped it, a lot of people would be struggling a lot more.” Edward Keefer, 38, a landscaper who lives in Park Heights, said the food drives are many people’s only way to get a meal as they wait for unemployment checks to arrive. “It means a lot,” he said. “A lot of people can’t afford nothing right now. All they’ve got is hope, that somebody helps them.”

Maryland youth detention center cleared for use as possible quarantine site
.W
State officials have cleared out a juvenile detention facility in Western Maryland for use as a coronavirus quarantine facility if such a need arises. Five youth who were being held at the all-male, high security Savage Mountain Youth Center in Allegany County were transferred over the weekend to the Victor Cullen Center in Frederick County. “We felt that was the best thing to do, just kind of make sure we have that facility just in case,” said Eric Solomon, a spokesman for the Department of Juvenile Services. “Since our population is on the lower side, at least we have some flexibility as to where we can move kids if we need to.” Savage Mountain was well below its capacity of 24. Victor Cullen now has 26 youth committed, and has a capacity for 48. Staff from Savage Mountain have been spread around to other facilities, Solomon said. Though classes at public schools statewide has been cancelled for the foreseeable future, the state’s secretaries of education and juvenile services agreed that instruction will continue at the juvenile detention facilities. Like other state employees deemed “critical,” the teachers and staff are getting double pay. Nick Moroney, of the Attorney General Office’s Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit, said continuing instruction is necessary. “It’s a really good idea that education goes forward, and not just for the normal reason that kids need and are entitled to education," Moroney said. “You’re talking about six hour of the kids’ days - they have nothing else to do except be in class.” Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Emanuel Brown, the judge in charge of the city’s juvenile division, did not respond to a request for comment about whether judges are managing the docket differently in light of coronavirus concerns. Solomon said visitation has been suspended except for parents, and they must go through health screenings.

Disability advocates push Hogan administration for pledge to protect rights if ventilator use is rationed
.W
A coalition of advocates for Marylanders with disabilities petitioned Gov. Larry Hogan to give medical providers clear direction that access to treatment, ventilators and hospital beds should not depend on a person’s abilities if they need to triage patients for scarce resources during the coronavirus pandemic. States are evaluating whether to establish a hierarchy for who would have access to all treatments if there are shortages; the Hogan administration must approve any such plan in Maryland. So far, the Republican governor has not endorsed any such patient priorities and the state does not have a shortage of beds or ventilators, a Hogan spokesman said Tuesday. Protocols in a handful of states have drawn legal challenges. After a civil rights complaint in Alabama, that state withdrew a policy that instructed hospitals there to deny ventilators to patients with “severe or profound mental retardation,” “moderate to severe dementia” and “severe traumatic brain injury.” Lauren Young, litigation director for Disability Rights Maryland, said critical medical treatment must be equally accessible. About 20 disability advocates signed on to a letter sent in early April to Hogan, including the Maryland chapters of The Arc, the National Federation of the Blind and the National Alliance on Mental Health. The letter describes the protection people with disabilities have from discrimination in medical treatment under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Affordable Care Act. The advocates say the country’s “history of discrimination in health care for persons with disabilities must be recognized as continuing to impact healthcare decisions and biases, and must be addressed.” Having the governor affirm the rights of all Marylanders during the pandemic, both in policy public statement and influence, would be an important step to making sure treatment is accessible and guide providers to avoid discrimination, Young said. Short of such an action, she said, medical providers could be left to their own judgments. “These laws apply to hospitals experiencing a medical equipment, bed or staffing shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as state policies concerning how resources should be allocated in the event of such shortages,” the advocates wrote to Hogan. "Direction is needed to ensure equal access to ventilators and other treatment, and to prevent the unlawful deprivation of life based on disability status. “Ableism must not direct our response to this crisis.” Hogan was expected to be presented with a plan drafted by ethicists, doctors and state leaders, but it is unclear whether the governor has received a final set of recommendations or when he might act. The plan was to be based on treatment for people who are likely to survive the new coronavirus and also believed to be healthy enough to survive longer term. The governor would need to approve the plan before hospitals could begin any rationing of equipment, should that become necessary. Ventilators have been the subject of much attention, as doctors in Italy and Spain reported widespread shortages and medical teams are bracing for such a threat in the United States. COVID-19 can cause severe respiratory problems, so ventilators are key tools in helping people survive. The machine pumps oxygen into their lungs while their bodies heal. Including new shipments of ventilators, the state has almost 2,000. Less than a third are actively in use, according to the Maryland Hospital Association. As of Tuesday, 14,193 Marylanders have tested positive for the coronavirus and 584 people have died. Under guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, states must ensure treatment decisions are based only on individualized assessments and objective medical evidence. The agency’s office of civil rights said no one should be denied medical care because of “stereotypes, assessments of quality of life, or judgments about a person’s relative ‘worth’ based on the presence or absence of disabilities.” In the letter to Hogan, Maryland’s disability advocates demanded: People with disabilities must have an equal opportunity to receive life-sustaining treatment.  Doctors and triage teams must assume that they are not free from bias in making critical treatment decisions.  Medical teams must not assume that if a patient has a diagnosis, such as an intellectual disability, autism, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida or schizophrenia, he or she can be denied care. That person also cannot be given lower priority for treatment.  Assumptions should not be made about the strength of a person’s immune system based on a diagnosis, such as AIDS, without an individualized review.

‘Why not make masks?’: Westminster cleaners giving out face coverings for essential workers
.W
A Westminster-based cleaners business has started making face masks for members of the community who still need to be out and about during the coronavirus pandemic. Admiral West Cleaners announced via Facebook on Tuesday that they would be selling two cloth face masks for $15 and giving out free cloth face masks for essential workers with a work ID starting Thursday. The masks are available in solid patterns and neutral colors and are cleaned and sanitized. After they wash the face masks, they use a steamer to sanitize them, according to co-owner Jemima Moise. Moise thought of the idea to distribute masks as way to build business while also helping the community. “Last week it was really slow and I was thinking, ‘OK, what can we do? We don’t have any customers coming in,’ ” Moise said. "I saw online that a lot of people were asking about face masks — people that were working in a hospital, all the essential people, they didn’t have masks. I was thinking, ‘How can I help?’ As a dry cleaner, we have all the equipment, we have fabrics, why not make masks?” In order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order that customers and employees must wear face masks while in stores or using public transportation, starting April 18. According to Moise, it was after this announcement when things got “crazy” and “overwhelming.” The Carroll County Health Department and Board of County Commissioners issued a statement Wednesday in support of that measure and strongly recommending that residents wear a cloth face covering in all public settings where social distancing is difficult. It was because of the high demand for masks that Moise was able to hire back four employees that she had to lay off, and she gained a volunteer as well. “It was only the two of us making the masks in the beginning, so we’ve been working really hard, but now I have everybody here, the whole team and we’re working together, we’re making masks,” Moise said. “We’re trying to catch up and fulfill all the orders that we have in so far. It’s been rewarding; people are so grateful that we’re doing this, and it makes us feel good to be able to help.” Moise has not had a chance to calculate the exact number of masks they have made so far because of how busy they have been. As of Thursday, they had a request for about 500 masks, with even more added on Friday that Moise had not had a chance to calculate at the time. They also plan to donate to any organization that asks — but only 10 at a time for now while they catch up on other orders, according to Moise. The company has mainly been promoting their service on Facebook, but they have not been able to respond to all requests on the page. “I haven’t had a chance to go on Facebook and look at any other request. I’m still trying to catch up from the day before [Wednesday],” Moise said. The demand for masks in the community has been great, and she said they will continue to make them as long as they are needed; they are just working to catch up on orders. The cleaners offers free pickup and delivery along with drive-thru service during business hours. Masks can be picked up at the company’s locations in Westminster, at 103 Englar Road, and in Phoenix, at 14242 Jarrettsville Pike. The Westminster location is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Phoenix location is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Customers may sign up online for pickup and delivery at the company’s website, https://admiralwestcleaners.com.

South Laurel/Montpelier: Things to do while you’re in quarantine
.W
We are all experiencing challenging times. These challenges are causing us to extend a hand to those in our community who have a need we can help with, and to share information about services, activities and other ways to deal positively with this new situation, the coronavirus pandemic. In my own family, there are now four of us full time at home. My husband and I are in the senior citizen “high risk” category; our adult daughter is working from home; and our 15-year-old granddaughter has been out of school for two weeks and is not scheduled to go back until at least the end of April. Her school is providing online lessons and assignments, but she misses actually being there. At least the weather has been passable, so we can get out of the house for awhile. Among the many options for students now that schools are temporarily closed are a wide range of free audible books at stories.audible.com. The selections are grouped by grade level and include a large selection of classics such as “The Call of the Wild,” “Frankenstein” and “Moby Dick.” The selections are available in six different languages. This is a fun way to engage those at home, and to provide a learning experience as well. Many grocery and convenience stores have initiated special morning shopping hours for seniors during periods of the day when the stores are less crowded. Those stores include Aldi’s, Target, Trader Joe’s, Walgreens, Giant and Walmart. Check out the stores’ websites for hours and days when this service is available. State Sen. Douglas Peters’ staff has compiled a list of contact points for various resources that our residents may find valuable. The list includes websites for CDC, the governor’s office, Maryland Departments of Health and Department of Commerce, Prince Georges’ public schools, utilities and various other public service groups. If you wish to contact the senator’s office directly, email Douglas.Peters@senate.state.md.us. Blessings to all in the South Laurel/Montpelier community. Enjoy the spring flowers and the squirrels, bunnies and birds in your yard.

Hundreds in DC asked to quarantine after exposure in church
.W
Several hundred people are being asked to self-quarantine after potential exposure to the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in Washington D.C., identified as the rector of prominent Episcopal church. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that anyone who entered Christ Church Georgetown on Feb. 24 or between Feb. 28 and March 3 is requested to self-quarantine for two weeks from the date of their entrance to the church. The new precautions come as the virus continues to roil the normal routine in the nation’s capital. A popular convention city and a springtime destination for hundreds of school trips and thousands of tourists, Washington officials have insisted that the city remains open for business. But tourism leaders admit that they expect virus fears to cut into the visitor numbers — including for the popular Cherry Blossom Festival, which starts on March 20. Officials on Saturday had announced the district’s first positive test, but identified the victim only as a man in his 50s. A second local positive test involves a man who visited the Washington area from Nigeria, but he was being hospitalized in Maryland. Rev. Timothy Cole, the church rector, announced Sunday that he was the person whom city officials had been referring to as “patient 1.” He remains hospitalized in stable condition and the church has canceled all activities until further notice. Late Monday, the district announced three more confirmed cases, including one man who had attended Christ Church. The church's Facebook page said its organist/choirmaster was quarantined at home but feeling well “given the circumstances.” Dr. Anjali Talwalkar of the Washington Health Department said Monday that an exposure risk is defined as coming within six feet of a person with active virus symptoms. “Several hundred people were potentially impacted,” she said. A Washington high school linked to the second case was closed Monday, though no new confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported. Three people who stayed at the same house as the Nigerian man who tested positive in Maryland were tested Sunday and all were negative. But one of them works at the School Without Walls High School. Bowser said the school was closed for a deep cleaning and to give time to communicate with staff and parents; she expects the school to re-open Tuesday. Two charter schools in Washington, D.C., also voluntarily closed Monday but there have been no reported or suspected virus cases linked to either. Several Republican members of Congress announced they would self-quarantine after coming in contact with an infected person during the recent Conservative Political Action Conference. Bowser said she was “evaluating" whether to declare a ”public health emergency" if the virus continues to spread. As both a mayor and the de-facto governor of a quasi-state, Bowser has more powers than the average city mayor. Formally declaring a health emergency would enable her to impose quarantines and closures and also take steps to prevent price gouging on supplies, she said. “I don't believe that's where we are right now,” Bowser said. Maryland has reported six confirmed cases. Virginia has reported three. ___ Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo and Robert Burns in Washington, and Randall Chase in Dover, Delaware, contributed to this report.

University of Maryland providing masks, personal protective equipment to hospitals
.W
As hospitals around the country face a shortage of personal protective equipment to fight the new coronavirus, the University of Maryland, College Park is delivering N95 respirators and surgical face masks to the state university’s medical system in Baltimore, President Wallace D. Loh announced Monday. The state’s flagship university discovered the face masks in emergency stockpiles stored more than 15 years ago during the avian flu pandemic, officials said. The 12,000 N95 respirators and 12,000 surgical masks will be provided to the University of Maryland Medical System for health care workers fighting to save those infected by COVID-19, according to the university. As of Friday, the university’s Fischell Department of Bioengineering had collected 14,650 pairs of gloves, 2,660 surgical masks, 102 disposable lab coats, 59 N95 masks, 100 shoe covers, 17 pairs of goggles, 200 conical test tubes, 320 coveralls, 500 hair covers and 18 gallons of ethanol, the university said. More than 15 labs, including bioengineering, biology, physics, animal sciences, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and the Nanocenter donated needed medical supplies to hospitals in Prince George’s County and Baltimore, the university said. Even the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center’s Scene Shop’s six boxes of N95 masks and about 40 boxes of protective gloves went to a hospital: Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda. “When something big like this is going on, everybody is figuring out what they can do to help,” said Reuven Goren, the scene shop’s coordinator, who uses protective gear like masks and gloves to build sets and props. The university libraries’ conservation department donated an additional 250 N95 respirator masks along with gloves and cover garments to the University Health Center. The equipment had been kept on hand as part of its disaster response protocol, in the event books and other library materials needed saving. The university’s Department of Animal and Avian Sciences is hoping to lend to a hospital a ventilator that had been used for humans for several years before being acquired by the department to be used on swine, officials said. A shortage of the devices is expected as COVID-19 cases overwhelm U.S. hospitals. Veterinarian and instructor Angela Black said she never had a chance to use her department’s ventilator on animals. "I glanced at it and thought, ‘Oh my God, we should donate that,’” Black said in a news release.

Maryland seeks investigation of politically connected company that hasn’t delivered masks, ventilators
.W
Maryland’s governor is asking the attorney general to investigate a politically connected company that contracted to provide the state with millions of dollars’ worth of medical equipment that never arrived. The state signed a $12.5 million deal April 1 with Blue Flame Medical LLC for 1.5 million N95 masks and 110 ventilators. The masks and ventilators were supposed to ship April 14, according to documents provided by the state. The state paid half of the money up front, according to the documents. The goods never arrived, and Maryland canceled the contract Friday. “Unfortunately, despite numerous requests for information and order status, Blue Flame Medical has yet to deliver any items under this order, or provide any pertinent data as to a pending shipment,” wrote Danny Mays, the state’s director of procurement, in a letter sent to Blue Flame on Thursday. Blue Flame Medical was founded just weeks ago by Mike Gula, a former Republican Party fundraiser and consultant whose resume shows no experience in the medical field. A spokeswoman for Attorney General Brian Frosh confirmed receiving a referral about the contract. The office has a policy not to comment on pending or potential investigations. Gov. Larry Hogan’s office referred questions to the Department of General Services. The contract dispute between Maryland and Blue Flame Medical was first reported Saturday by the Wall Street Journal. In a text sent to The Baltimore Sun, Blue Flame officials dispute the state’s characterization of the deal. The company says the due date for delivering the masks and ventilators is June 30. “We were hoping to deliver the shipment of masks and ventilators in April, significantly earlier than the agreed upon June date," the company said. The company provided the first page of a purchase order showing a “deliver by” date of June 30. The state countered by providing a copy of an invoice from Blue Flame listing a “ship date” of April 14. A state source familiar with the contract said the June 30 date simply represented the end of the state’s fiscal year. Blue Flame officials said via text that they’ve had trouble getting supplies out of China and have kept Maryland officials apprised of the situation. Gula started Blue Flame in late March with John Thomas, also a Republican consultant and former candidate, according to multiple news reports. When asked how political consultants could successfully switch to selling healthcare supplies in the midst of a global pandemic, Thomas told Politico in March: “It’s just relationship-based. I can’t say anything else.” The sudden rise in demand for masks, gowns, gloves, ventilators and testing supplies because of the coronavirus pandemic has left hospitals and states scrambling to find suppliers. Hogan earned national acclaim — and criticism from President Donald Trump — for leveraging his connections with South Korean officials to buy 500,000 coronavirus tests from a South Korean company. Hogan’s wife, Yumi Hogan, was born in South Korea and called the South Korean ambassador for help in securing the deal. The state still needed to obtain swabs and other supplies to put the tests into use, and has been rolling them out in “high-priority hot spots” such as nursing homes and at test sites on the Eastern Shore targeting poultry industry workers.

Johns Hopkins engineers develop makeshift ventilators
.W
Johns Hopkins University engineers are working to develop a simple battery powered, pumpless ventilator to fill the need for the life-preserving breathing machines during the coronavirus pandemic. The device can be manufactured quickly and relatively inexpensively because it has fewer moving parts, and can run for 24 hours on a single 12-volt battery. It can use oxygen and pressurized air lines already in hospitals or from sources in the field. The engineers are testing their prototype on simulated patients. As cases of the COVID-19 illness continue to climb in many states or remain high, ventilators have been in high demand and sometimes short supply. They afford patients critically ill with the respiratory disease time to heal by pumping needed oxygen into their lungs. Hopkins teams also have sought other ways to boost their use, including by creating a special device so patients could share one machine. This team is also working on software to monitor multiple ventilators from a central location. For the simple ventilators, the engineers are trying to determine the fastest way to manufacture them. The prototype parts were made with 3-D printing that could be too costly. They also are short on some supplies such as electromagnets needed to make valves. The goal is to have 10,000 ventilators made with this design.

Our View: Thumbs up to local makers of masks, private schools’ quick online pivot, a drive-thru confessional
.W
THUMBS UP: With all the tragic and discouraging news unfolding daily out of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s heartening to see so many local citizens stepping up to fill a critical void. We featured some, though certainly not all, in Thursday’s Times, among them the Carroll County Mask Makers Facebook group founded by Julie Thieberger Rosenthal. “Friday [March 21], I made a mask and posted it on the Sykesville page and a nurse from Fort Meade contacted me and said, ‘Oh my God, can you please make some of these?’ ” Rosenthal told us. By the middle of last week, the group had more than 650 members — 70 volunteers who sew, 20 who pick up and drop off the finished masks, and others who donate materials — and had sewn and donated more than 2,600 free masks to health care workers all around the region, including at Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center, Frederick Hospital, Sinai Hospital and University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, according to the group’s records. While hand- or machine-sewn masks are filling some gaps immediately, masks of a more sophisticated manufacture might soon meet hospital approvals and help fill in for more critical situations. Zach Tomlin is taking his IT company, Westminster-based Tomlin Technology Inc., in that direction. After finding open-sourced plans for using 3-D printers to print face masks, Tomlin and his company decided to jump all in, got monetary donations from other companies, and ordered machinery. “We are up to over $3,000 in donations and now have nine printers on the way,” he told us. Tomlin said he hopes to get up and running next week and will be donating the masks they produce. Kudos to the Mask Makers to Tomlin and to everyone out there doing what they can to help get us through this crisis. THUMBS UP: When the Maryland State Department of Education closed schools after March 13, private schools followed suit. And the private schools in Carroll seem to have made a speedy and successful transition to online learning. Students at Springdale Preparatory Academy in New Windsor were already learning virtually on March 18. Part of keeping a structured environment was writing an adjusted honor code for an online environment and having each teacher draft their own “classroom” expectations. Carroll Christian School in Westminster started with work packets for students through a drive-thru system for picking up and turning in work. Technology staff began setting up students and staff for virtual classroom learning, which began March 23, with teachers teaching video lectures just as they would in person, and students watch from home. Mount Airy Christian Academy began distance learning March 18. Each day, first thing in the morning, students receive a video from teachers for each of their subjects and notes on what assignments to complete for the day. At Gerstell Academy in Finksburg, remote educational opportunities are for academic classes as well as special areas. Division heads at the school are holding video conference meetings with parents to update them. North Carroll Community School in Westminster, started distance learning on Monday, March 30 with a focus on teacher created content. Teachers are working on preparing video lessens and interactive games to teach concepts. The Montessori School of Westminster sent kids home on March 13 with two weeks of work to do as well as some digital activities for the older ones, and they moved learning online on March 30. Carroll Lutheran School in Westminster also began with two weeks of hard copy work and then moved to educational websites such as Google Classroom on March 30. THUMBS UP: With the restrictions put in place as we attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus, gatherings are forbidden and churches have been closed. But, to many, the need to exercise their faith is more important than ever, so various houses of worship are doing what they can, including holding services online. St. John Roman Catholic Church in Westminster has been offering drive-thru confessionals as a way to help members of the community exercise their faith while also social distancing. “Everyone knows when you go to Burger King or when you go to Chick-fil-A or you go through a drive-thru — you kind of pull up to the window, you place your order — so we kind of set it up the same way as a drive-thru experience,” said Father Mark Bialek of St. John. According to Emily Alster, communications coordinator for St. John Roman Catholic Church, they have tried to stick to their regular times for confessions: 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Wednesdays; 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays; and 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Sundays. The confessions started March 18, and they had a bigger turnout than expected, Bialek said. “We were surprised at the response,” he said. “We had over 70 cars show up between those two hours, so I heard confessions for about two and a half hours. People were very patient, people stayed in their cars and we got through all the confessions.”

Letters: Grateful for masks donated to direct support professionals; In support of Titus for Circuit Court judge; No shortage of milk thanks to dairy farmers
.W
Grateful for masks donated to direct support professionals During the current coronavirus/COVID-19 crisis, well-deserved attention has been given to the needs of our health care workers and first responders. This holds true with the distribution of Personal Protective Equipment, commonly called “PPE.” Unfortunately, essential direct support professionals (DSP’s) supporting citizens with intellectual and developmental disabilities are at the bottom of the list when it comes to the allocation of PPE. There are numerous group homes and assisted living homes across Carroll County supporting many segments of our population who are considered “vulnerable.” The Direct Support Professionals working in these homes need PPE too! I would like to give heartfelt thanks to Edith Burbage and Kathy Smyth. These two ladies reached out to me after reading Jon Kelvey’s March 24 article, “Vulnerable in group homes coping with concerns.” Edith and Kathy made over 80 washable fabric masks for use by the DSP’s working in the group homes operated by Flying Colors of Success. It is nice to know that there are community members willing to help us as we care for some of Carroll County’s most vulnerable citizens! C. Michael Hardesty Littlestown, Pennsylvania The author is the president and CEO of the nonprofit Flying Colors of Success, Inc. In support of Titus for Circuit Court judge I am writing in support of Judge Richard Titus, and his election to the Circuit Court. There are many reasons that I support retaining Judge Titus, Gov. Hogan’s selection to the Circuit Court. I could mention that he is the only one in this race that has been vetted by a rigorous selection process, and is the only one who has actually served as a judge on our Circuit Court. Mostly, though, I support him because I know him to be a thorough, thoughtful and impartial judge and person. I also know of his professionalism and skill as a litigator. I litigated against Judge Titus when he was a practicing attorney. I also had the privilege of being on the same side with him representing the same client for a brief period before he was appointed to the bench. I have seen up close his legal ability, hard work, honesty and skill in the representation of his clients. Even as his opponent, he treated me and my clients with courtesy and civility, while at the same time vigorously representing his clients. As a practicing attorney, I believe that he lends the kind of skill, diligence, temperament, impartiality and professionalism that makes him well suited to be on the bench. Judge Titus has already proven, as attorney and Judge, that he possesses each of these qualities. I urge everyone voting in the upcoming election to strongly consider voting to retain Judge Titus on our Circuit Court bench regardless of your political party. The election of Judges should not be a partisan matter. It should only be about who is best qualified in terms of skill, temperament, experience and diligence to serve on the bench. To me, that is Judge Titus. Tom McCarron Eldersburg The author is former chair of the Carroll County Democratic Central Committee and former chair of the Freedom Area Citizens Council. No shortage of milk thanks to dairy farmers On behalf of the 10,000 dairy farm families that I have the privilege to represent, I want to acknowledge how difficult this time is for everyone. Our prayers are especially with those families whose health has been affected by the coronavirus. Our dairy farm families are committed to providing wholesome dairy products to feed our communities, especially during these challenging, changing times. And even though times are tough, we are in this together. While consumers are facing unprecedented changes in the way they live their lives, dairy farmers are affected as well. With dramatic shifts in the distribution network, school and restaurant closures, the dairy supply chain has been disrupted. Half of all the cheese that’s produced is normally consumed through restaurants, and about 7% of the milk that’s produced is used for in-school meals. And while school meals are still being provided to families, it’s not nearly as much as when school is in session. The good news is that more consumers are preparing meals at home, so the demand for milk at grocery stores has skyrocketed. Initially, panic-buying led to limited availability in stores; however, the distribution system is catching up, products are becoming more readily available, and supply limits are few. Rest assured that there is no shortage of milk. Farmers will continue to produce a product that is safe and nutritious. Consumers can continue to support the local economy and farmers by purchasing dairy as a part of their regular groceries.

Carroll County companies helping keep ventilators running, making protective masks in COVID-19 fight
.W
Three Carroll County-based companies were among those granted a combined $1.6 million by the state for their part in producing personal protective equipment (PPE). The owners of these companies say the funding will pay engineering costs and ramp up their processes. Three of the 20 Maryland companies who received money from the Maryland COVID-19 Emergency Relief Manufacturing Fund are from Carroll: CoastTec of Eldersburg, LAI International of Westminster, and Strouse of Westminster. The funding is going to companies that produce items to protect against infection from the coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, including face shields, gowns, gloves masks, and hospital equipment. CoastTec is switching part of its operation to creating battery packs for Vyaire ventilators after realizing they had the advanced engineering power to solve a problem facing hospitals. Jonathan Sevel, CEO of CoastTec, learned that one of the first things to fail in many ventilators is the battery pack that might last three to five years. He learned that many ventilators are sitting in storage for want of a battery pack. Ventilators can be lifesaving for patients who experience the most serious respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. CoastTec is a national leader in battery backups for computers. They invested engineering to design ventilator battery packs, and will start producing them after adding a new production line and doing some tooling changes. The state grant will help with these startup costs. Sevel believes they can have the first 3,000 packs built and assembled in the next 30 days. “When it comes to electronics, that what we know, that’s what we do,” he said. “I’m totally thrilled about it.” Strouse, of Westminster, was already producing N95 masks off and on before the COVID-19 threat emerged, President and CEO Sue Chambers said. Now they are fulfilling much larger orders. The company is also producing face shields because its equipment is conducive to that kind of manufacturing, she said. They’re able to make the PPE at a high volume, about 15,000 N95 masks per day and 8,000 face shields per day. They are adding additional shifts to their schedule. The state grant will help automate more on the packaging end to increase capacity, she said. For their employees, she said it is a good feeling to know they are doing important work to protect people in a difficult time. LAI International is a manufacturer of high-tech components for the aerospace, energy, and industrial sectors According to the news release, the state grant will support their production of face shields for medical personnel and other workers who use them for protection. The company had not responded to a call as of 1:30 p.m. Friday. More than 200 companies applied for the grant and the state plans to award more funds in coming weeks, according to a news release. In the release, Gov. Larry Hogan said: “Ramping up our supply of PPE is a critical building block in our state’s recovery plan, and we are taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to secure these resources for our front line workers. I want to thank and commend the local businesses who have shifted their operations and increased production to help us save lives and flatten the curve.”

From directing traffic to sewing masks, hospital worker Hizbawi Kiros does whatever’s asked to battle COVID-19
.W
Until early March, Hizbawi Kiros worked as a valet at Sinai Hospital. He’s happiest when interacting with people who need his help, so he liked the job, which he’d held for almost three years. But when Sinai created a drive-up COVID-19 testing center on the parking lot where Kiros worked, his bosses asked him to become a traffic director for patients, some of whom would show up frightened or confused. He embraced the new role. “It was not difficult at all,” the Owings Mills resident said. “We just asked what was required and how do we make it efficient?” The 42-year-old Kiros has become a one-man Swiss Army knife for LifeBridge Health since the hospital chain began confronting the coronavirus pandemic. “In the mix of everything that was going on in the past weeks, with everybody scrambling to adjust and be prepared, it stood out that the one person constantly asking, ‘What can I do?’ or ‘How can I help?’ was Kiros,” said Bernie Gerst, assistant vice president for parking and security at Lifebridge. Kiros grew up in Ethiopia. His life carried him across an ocean and into information-technology jobs with large companies such as Monsanto and Veritas — preparation for the current crisis. Using pre-written billboards, he was able to explain to patients how they would approach the testing tent without them having to roll down their windows. Others he had to turn away because they arrived without referrals or appointments. “Some would get angry,” he said. “And of course, it takes a certain skill set to understand what the requirement is and give the right information … From my background, I worked in high-efficiency, high-stress environments where you have to remain calm and concise to what it required.” Those who worked with Kiros praised his clarity and poise. “He was perfect,” Gerst said. “That was a job where he clearly stepped out of his normal role and jumped into this one in such a great fashion. He’s got that attitude and that approach of, ‘Whatever you need, just let me know and I’ll do it for you.’” On a recent Wednesday afternoon at Northwest Hospital in Randallstown, Kiros bent over a white counter in a makeshift operations room adorned by little more than exposed pipes and bare lightbulbs. With hands covered by blue surgical gloves, he assembled the masks needed by doctors and nurses to battle the disease. He had not sewed a stitch of clothing since he was a boy, working at his grandmother’s side as she mended pants ripped during neighborhood soccer games. Now, he is part of a team of 30 assembling masks from materials donated by Under Armour. He does not view himself as any kind of hero. “If I’m efficient enough, and I’m providing what needs to be done, that’s where I derive my satisfaction" he said. "I don’t individually say, ‘I did this because this happened.’ I say, ‘I participated to make something better.’” Know a hero?
